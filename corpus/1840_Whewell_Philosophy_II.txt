the philosophy of biology 



chapter i 
analogy of biology with otheil scifinces 

 in the history of the sciences after treating of 
the sciences of classification we proceeded to what are 
there termed the organical sciences including in this 
term physiology and comparative anatomy a peculiar 
feature in this group of sciences is that they inyolre the 
notion of litdng things the notion of ltfe however vague 
and obscure it may be in mens minds is apprehended as 
a peculiar idea not resolvable into any other ideas such 
for instance as matter and motion the separation be 
tween living creatures and inert matter between organ 
ized and unorganized beings is conceived as a positive 
and insurmountable barrier the two classes of otgects 
are considered as of a distinct kind produced and pre 
served by different forces whether the idea of life is 
really thus original and fundamental and whether if so 
it be one idea only or involve several it must be the 
province of true philosophy to determine what we 
shall here offer may be considered as an attempt to con 
tribute something to the determination of these ques 
tions but we shall perhaps be able to make it appear 
that science is at present only in the course of its pro 
gress towards a complete solution of such problems 

since the main feature of those sciences of which 

b

 philosophv op biology 

we have now to examine the philosophy is that they 
involve the idea of life it would be desirable to have 
them designated by a name expressive of that circum 
stance the word physiology by which they have most 
commonly been described means the science of nature 
and though it would be easy to explain by reference to 
history the train of thought by which the word was 
latterly restricted to living nature it is plain that the 
name is etymologically speaking loose and improper 
the term biology which means exactly what we wish to 
express the science of lifcy has often been used and has 
of late become not uncommon among good writers i 
shall therefore venture to employ it in most cases rather 
than the word physiology 

 as i have already intimated one main inquiry 
belonging to the philosophy of biology is concerning the 
fundamental idea or ideas which the science involves 
if we look back at the course and the results of our dis 
quisitions respecting other sciences in this work and 
assume as we may philosophically do that there will be 
some general analogy between those sciences and thisf 
in their developement and progress we shall be enabled 
to anticipate in some measure the nature of the view 
which we shall now have to take we have seen that 
in other subjects the fundamental ideas on which sci 
ence depended and the conceptions derived from these 
were at first vague obscure and confused — that by 
gradual steps by a constant union of thought and obser 
vation these conceptions become more and more clear 
more and more definite — and that when they approached 
complete distinctness and precision there were made 
great positive discoveries into which these conceptions 
entered and thus the new precision of thought was 
fixed and perpetuated in some conspicuous and lasting 
truths thus we have seen how the first confused 



digitized by vjooq ic 



analogy op biology with other sciences 

mechanical conceptions force and the like were from 
time to time growing clearer down to the epoch of newton 
— how true conceptions of genera and of wider classes 
gradually unfolded themselves among the botanists of the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries — how the idea of 
substance became steady enough to govern the theories 
of chemists only at the epoch of lavoisier — how the 
idea of polarity although often used by physicists and 
chemists is even now somewhat vague and indistinct in 
the minds of the greater part of speculators in like man 
ner we may expect to find that the idea of life if indeed 
that be the governing idea of the science which treats 
pf living things will be found to have been gradually 
approaching towards a distinct and definite form among 
the physiologists of all ages up to the present day and 
if this be the case it may not be considered superfluous 
with reference to so interesting a subject if we employ 
some space in tracing historically the steps of this pro 
gress — the changes by which the originally loose idea 
of life or of vital powers became more nearly suited 
to the purposes of science 

 but we may safely carry this analogy between bio 
logy and other sciences somewhat further we have 
seen in other sciences that while men in their speculations 
were thus tending towards a certain peculiar idea but 
before they as yet saw it clearly to be peculiar and inde 
pendent they naturally and inevitably clothed their specu 
lations in conceptions borrowed from some other extra 
neous idea and the unsatisfactoriness of all such at 
tempts and the necessary consequence of this a constant 
alteration and succession of such inappropriate hypotheses 
were indications and aids of the progress which was going 
on towards a more genuine form of the science for 
instance we have seen that in chemistry so long as men 
refused to recognise a peculiar and distinct kind of power

in the affinity which binds together the elements of 
bodies they framed to themselves a series of hypotheses 
mch constructed according to the prevalent ideas of the 
time by wm they tried to represent the relation of the 
compound to the ingredients rst supposing that the 
elements bestowed upon the whole qualities resenming 
their own i — then giving up this supposition and imagin 
ing that the properties of the body depended upon the 
hape of the component particles — then as their view 
expanded assuming that it was not the shape but the 
jnihanical forees of the particles which gave the body 
its attributes — and finally acquiescing in or rather re 
luctantly admitting the idea of affinity conceived as a 
peculiar power different not only from material contact 
but from any mechanical or dynamical attraction 

now we cannot but think it very natural to find that 
the history of biology offers a series of occurrences of the 
same nature the notions of life in general or of any 
vital functions or vital forces in particular are obviously 
very loose and vague as they exist in the minds of most 
men the discrepancies and controversies respecting the 
definitions of all such terms which are found in all works 
on physiology afford us abundant evidence that these 
notions are not at least not generally apprehended with 
complete clearness and steadiness we shall therefore 
find approaches and advances intermediate steps gra 
dually leading up to the greatest degree of distinctness 
which has yet been attained and in those stages of 
imperfect apprehension in which the notions ef life and 
of vital powers are still too loose id unformed to be 
applied independently we may expect to find them sup 
pohed and embodied by means of hrpotheses borrowed 
from other suljects and thus made so distinct and sub 
etwtial as to supply hk least a temporary possibility of

sect l mystical schoollji order to ablnreviate as 
much as can conveniently be done the historical view 
which i have now to take i shall altogether pass over 
the physiological speculations of the ancients and begin 
my survey with the general revival of science in modem 
times 

we need not dwell long on the fantastical and xmsub 
stantial doctrines concerning physiology which prevailed 
in the sixteenth century and which flowed in a great 
measure from the fertile but illregulated imaginations of 
the cultivators of alchemy and magic one of the pro 
minent doctors of this school is the celebrated paracelsus 
whose doctrines contained a combination of biblical in 
terpretations visionary religious notions fanciful ana 
logies and bold experiments in practical medicine the 
opinion of a close but mystical resemblance of parts 
between the universe and the human body the macrocosm

succsssive biological hypotheses 

and the microcosm as these two things thus compared 
were termed had probably come down from the neopla 
tonists it was adopted by the paracelsists and con 
aeeted with tarious astrological dreams and cabbalistic 
riddles a succession of later paracelsistsf bosicrucians 
and other fanatics of the same kind continued into the 
seventeenth century upon their notions was founded the 
pretension of curing pounds by a sympathetic powder 
which sir kenelm digby among others asserted while 
animal magnetismand the transfer of diseases from one per 
son to another i were maintained by others of this school 
they held too the doctrines of astral bodies correspond 
ing to each terrestrial body and of the signatures of plants 
that is certain features in their external form by which 
their virtues might be known how little advantage or 
progress real physiology could derive from speculations of 
this kind may be seen frxm this that their tendency was 
to obliterate the distinction between living and lifeless 
things according to paracelsus all things are alive eat 
drink and excrete even minerals and fluids accord 
ing to him and his school besides material and immaterial 
beings there are elementally spirits which hold an inter 
mediate place sylvansj nymphs gnomes salamanders cc 
by whose agency various processes of enchantment may be 
achieved and things apparently superiiatural explained 
thus this spiritualist scheme dealt with a world of its 
own by means of fseinciful inventions and mystical visions 
instead of making any step in the study of nature 

perhaps however one of the most fantastical of the 
inventions of paracelsus may be considered as indicating a 
perception of a peculiar character in the vital powers 
according to him the business of digestion is performed 
by a certain demon whom he calls arcjueus who has his

this fitnciful notion was afterwards adopted and expanded 
by van heimontf according to him the stomach anil 
spleen are both under the direction of this msterspiriti 
and these two organs form a sort of duumvirate in the body 

but though we msy see in such writers occasiona 
gleams of physiological thought the absence of definit 
physical relations in the speculations thus promulgated 
was naturally intolerable to men of sound understaudipg 
and scientific tendencies such men naturally took hold pf 
that part of the phenomena of life which eould be most disr 
tinctly conceived and which could be appwroptly explaine 
by means of the sciences then cultivated and this was th 
part which appeared to be reducible to chemical concop 
tions and doctrines it will readily be supposed tht fiie 
processes of chemistry have a considerable bearing upoa 
physiological processes d might till their range wa 
limited by a sound investigation be supposed to havq 
still more than they really had and thus a physiology

yius of halle in saxony physician and teacher in the 
gymnasium at koberg is pointed out by sprengel as the 
person who began to cultivate chemistry as distinct from 
the theosophic fisintasies of his predecessors and angelus 
sala of vienna f as his successor the latter has the 
laudable distinction of having rejected the prevalent con 
ceits about potable gold a universal medicine and the 
like in germany already at the beginning of the 
seventeenth century a peculiar chair of chtmiahria was 
already created at marpurg and many in various places 
pursued the same studies till in the middle of the seven 
teenth century we come to lemery§ the principal 
reformer of pharmaceutical chemistry but we are not 
here so much concerned with the practical as with the 
theoretical parts of iatrochemistry and hence we pass oh 
to sylvius i mid his system 

the opinion that chemistry had an important bearing 
upon physiology did not however begin with sylvius 
paracelsus among his extravagant absurdities did some 
service to medicine by drawing attention to this iniportant 
truth he used chemical principles for the explanation 
of particular diseases most or all of them according to 
him arise from the effervescence of salts from the com 
bustion of sulphur or from the coagulation of mercury 
his medicines were chemical preparations and it waib 
an undeniable advantage of the paracelsian doctrine that 
cbemistiy thus became indispensable to the physician 
we still retain a remnant of the chemical npmidhclaturq 
of paracelsus in the term tartoty denoting the stony con 
cretion which forms on the teeth ft according to him 
there is a certain substance the basis of all diseases which 
arise from a thickening of the juices and a collection of

eartby matter and this substance he calls tartattis 
because it burns like the fire of hell helmont the 
successor of paracelsus in many absurdities also followed 
him in the attempt to give a chemical account however 
loose and wild of the functions of the human body and 
is by sprengel considered with all his extravagancies as 
a meritorious and important discoverer the notion of 
the fermentation of fluids and of the aerial product 
thence resulting to which he gave the name of gas forms 
an important part of his doctrines and of the six diges 
tions which he assumes the jirst prepares an acid which 
is neutralized by the gall when it reaches the duodenum 
and this constitutes the second digestion 

i have already in the history of chemistry f stated 
that the doctrine of the opposition of acid and alkali the 
great step which theoretical chemistry owes to sylvius 
was first brought into view as a physiological tenet 
although we had then to trace its consequences in ano 
ther science tlie explanation of all the functions of the 
animal system both healthy and morbid by means of 
this and other chemical doctrines and the prescription of 
methods of cure founded upon such explanations form 
the scheme of the iatrochemical school a school which 
almost engrossed the favour of european physicians 
during the greater part of the seventeenth century 

sylvius taught medicine at leyden from the year 
 with so much success that boerhaave alone sur 
passed him his notions although he piqued himself 
on their originality were manifestly suggested in no 
small degree as all such supposed novelties are by the 
speculations of his predecessors and the spirit of the 
times like helmont he considers digestion as con 
sisting in a fermentation but he states it more definitely

as the effervescence of an acid supplied by the saliva 
and the pancreatic juice with the alkali of the gall by 
various other hypothetical processes all of a chemical 
nature the blood becomes a collection of various juices 
which are the subjects of the speculations of the iatro 
chemists to the entire neglect of the solid parts of 
the body diseases were accounted for by a supposed 
prevalence of one or the other of the acrid principles the 
acid or the alkaline and sylvius was bold enough to 
found upon these hypotheses practical methods of cuk 
which were in the highest degree mischievous 

the sylvian doctrine was often combined vnth some 
of the notions of the cartesian system of philosophy 
but this mixture i shall not notice since my present 
object is to trace the history of a mere cheniical physio 
logy as one of the unsuccessful attempts at a philosophy 
of life with various modifications this doctrine was 
diffused over europe it gave rise to several contro 
yersies which turned upon the questions of the novelty 
of the doctrine and the use of chemical remedies to 
wliich it pointed as well as upon its theoretical truth 
we need not dwell long upon thse controversies 
although they were carried on with no small vehemence 
in their time thus the school of paris opposed all 
innovation remained true to the galenic dogmatism and 
declared itself earnestly against all combination of che 
mistry with medicine and even against the chemical 
preparation of medicaments guy patin a celebrated 
and learned professor of that day declares f that the 
chemists are no better than forgers and ought to be pun 
ished as such the use of antimonial medicines was a 
main point of dispute between the iatrochemists and 
their opponents patin maintained that more men had 
been destroyed by antimony than by the thirty years wai

of germany and endeavonred to substantiate this asser 
tion by collecting all such cases in his martologium 
antimonii it must have been a severe blow to patin 
when in the doctors of the faculty of pari 
assembled by command of the parliament declared by a 
inajorlty of ninetytwo voices that the use of antimonial 
inedioin was allowable and laudable and when all 
attempts to st aside this decision iled 

fjorentius schuyl of leyden sought to recommend 
the iatrochemical doctrines by maintaining that they 
were to be found in the hippocratic writings nor was 
it difficult to give a chemical interpretation of the 
humoral pathdlogy of the ancients the italian f phy 
sicians also for the most part took this line and 
attempted to show the agreement of the principles of 
the ancient school of tnedicine with the new chemical 
notions this indeed is the usual manner in which the 
diffiision of new theoretical ideas becomes universal 

the progress of the cheniical school of medicine in 
england inquires our more especial nbtice willis was 
the most celebited champion of this sect he assumed 
but with modifications of his own the three paracelsian 
principles salt sulphur and mercury considered diges 
tion as the effect of an acid and explained other parts of 
the animal economy by distillation fermentation and the 
like all diseases arise from the want of the requisite 
ferment and the physician he saysf may be compared to 
a vintnerj since both the one and the other have to take 
care that the necessary fermentations go on that no 
foreign matter mixes itself with the wine of life to inter 
rupt or derange those operations in the middle of the 
seventeenth century medicine had reached a point in 
which the life of the animal body was considered as

taerely a chemical process the wish to explain fevery 
thing on known principles left no recognised difference 
between organized and unorganized bodies and diseases 
were treated according to this delusive notion the 
condition of chemistrj itielf during this period though 
net one of brilliant progress was sufficiently stable and 
flourishing to give a plausibility to any speculation which 
was founded on chemical principles and the real iiiflu 
ence of these principles in the animal fitame could not be 
denied 

the iatrochemists were at first resisted as we have 
seen by the adherents of the ancient schools they wer 
attacked on various grounds and finally deposed from 
their ascendency by another sect which we have to speak 
of as the iatromathematical or mechanical schieol this 
sect was no less unsatisfactory and errotieotis in its posi 
tive doctrines than the chemists had been fbl th animal 
frame is ho more a mere machine than a mere laboratory 
but it promoted the cause of truth by detecting and 
exposing the insufficient explanations and unproved 
assehions of the reigning theory 

boyle was one of the persons who first raised doubts 
against the current chemical doctrines df his time as we 
have elsewhere noted but his objections had no peculiar 
physiological import hermann conring the most 
learhed physician of his time a contemporary with syl 
vius took a view more pertinent to our present object 
for he not only rejected the alchemical and hermetical 
medicines but taught expressly that chemistry in its 
then existing condition was better fitted to be of use in 
the practice of pharmacy than in the theories of physio 
logy and pathology he made the important assertion 
alsc that chemical principles do not preexist as such in 
the animal body and that there are higher powers which

operate ia the organic world and which do not depend 
on the form and mixture of matter 

attempts were made to prove the acid and alkaline 
nature of the fluids of the human body by means of expe 
riments as by john viridet of geneva and by baimond 
vieussensf the latter of whom maintained that he had 
extracted an acid from the blood and detected a ferment 
in the stomach in opposition to him hecquet a dis 
ciple of the iatromathematical school endeavoured to 
prove that digestion was performed not by means of fer 
mentation but by trituration hecquets own opinions 
cannot be defended but his objections to the chemical 
doctrines and his assertion of the difference of chemical 
and organical processes are evidences of just thought f 

the most important opponents of the iatrochemical 
school were pitcaim in england bohn and hoffman in 
glermany and boerhaave in holland these eminent 
physicians about the end of the seventeenth century 
argued on the same grounds of observation that digestion 
is not fermentation and that the sylvian accounts of the 
origin of diseases by means of acid and alkali are false 
the arguments and authority of these and other persons 
finally gained an ascendency in the medical world and 
soon after this period we may consider the reign of 
the chemical school of physiology as past in fact the 
attempts to prove its assertions experimentally were of 
the feeblest kind and it had no solid basis on which it 
could rest so as to resist the shock of the next hypothesis 
which the progress of the physical sciences might impel 
against it we may therefore now consider the opinion 
of the mere chemical nature of the vital processes as 
disproved and we proceed next to notice the history of 
another unsuccessful essay to reduce vital actions to 
known actions of another kind

sect iii the latromaiheinaiical schoolin the firtt 
section of this chapter we enumerated the biological 
hypotheses which at first present themselves as the 
mystical the mechanical the chemical we might have 
expected that they should occur to mens minds in the 
order thus stated and in fact they did so for the phy 
siology of the ancient materialists as democritub and 
lucretius is mechanical so far as it is at all distinct in 
its views and thus the mechanical preceded the che 
mical doctrine but in modem times the fluid or che 
mical physiology was developed before the solid or 
mechanical of which the reason appears to have been 
this — that mechanics and chemistry began to assume a 
scientific character about the same time and that of the 
two chemistry not only appeared at first sight more 
applicable to the functions of the body because fill the 
more rapid changes appear to be connected with modi 
fications of the fluids of the animal system but also bjr 
its wider range of facts and morfe indefinite principle 
afltorded a better temporary refuge for the mind when 
perplexed by the difficulties and mysteries which spring 
out of the speculations concerning life but if chemistry 
was thus at first a more inviting field for the phyriologist 
mechanics soon became more attractive in virtue of the 
splendid results obtained by the schools of galileo and 
newton and when the insufficiency of chemical phy 
siology was discovered by trial as we have seen it vras 
the hope naturally arose that the mechanical principles 
which had explained so many of the phenomena of the 
external universe might also be found applicable to the 
smaller world of material life that the microcosm as 
well as the macrocosm might have its mechanical princi 
ples from this hope sprung the iatromathematical 
school or school of mechanical physiologists 

we may however divide this school into two parts

the italian and the cartesionewtoniau sect the 
former employed themselves in calculating and analysing 
a number of the properties of the animal frame which 
are undoubtedly mechanical the latter somewhat intoxi 
cated by the supposed triumphs of the corpuscular philo 
sophy endeavoured to extend these to physiology and 
for this purpose introduced into the subject many arbi 
trary and baseless hypotheses i will very briefly men 
tion some of the writers of both these sects 

the main points to which the italian or genuine 
mechanical physiologists attended were the application 
of mechanical calculations to the force of the muscles 
and of hydraulical reasonings to the motion of the fluids

similar principles the velocity of the blood we need not 
notice the controversies which thus arose since there is 
not involved in them any peculiar physiological principle 

the peculiar character of the iatromathematical 
school as an attempt at phrsiological theory is more 
manifest in its other section which we have called the 
cartesionewtonian the cartesian system pretended 
to account for the appearances and changes of bodied by 
means of the size figure and motion of their minute 
particles and though this system in its progress toward 
the intellectual empire of europe was suddenly overs 
turned by the rise of the newtonian philosophy these 
corpuscular doctrines rather gained than lost by the revo 
tion for the newtonian philosophy enlarged the powers 
of the corpuscular hypothesis by adding the effects of the 
attractive and repulsive forces of particles to those of 
their form and motion by this means although new 
tons discoveries did not in ct augment the probability 
of the corpuscular hypotliesis they so r increased its 
plausibility that this hypothesis found ftivour both with 
newton himself and his contemporaries no less than it 
had done with the cartesians 

the attempt to apply this corpuscular hypothesis to 
physiology was made by des cartes himself the gene 
ral character of such speculations may easily be guessed 
the secretions are effected by the organs operating after 
the manner of sieves round particles pass through 
cylindrical tubes pyramidal ones through triangular 
pores cubical particles through square apertures and 
thus different kinds of matter are separated similar

france cole keill jurin in england were the prin 
cipal cultivators of such studies in the earlier part of 
the eighteenth century physiological theorists considered 
it as almost selfevident that their science required them 
to reason concerning the size and shape of the particles 
of the fluids the diameter and form of the invisible 
vessels such was for instance the opinion of cheyne 
who held that acute fevers arise from the obstruction of 
the glands which occasions a more vehement motion of 
the blood mead the physician of the king and the 
friend of newton in like manner explained the effects of 
poisons by hypotheses concerning the form of their par 
ticlesf as we have already seen in speaking of chemistry 

it is not necessary for us to dwell longer on this 
subject or to point out the total insubsciency of the mere 
mechanical physiology the iatrochemists had neglected 
the effect of the solids of the living frame the iatro 
mathematicians attended only to these and even 
these were considered only as canals as cords as levers 
as lifeless machines these reasoners never looked for 
any powers of a higher order than the cohesion the 
resistance the gravity the attraction which operate in 
inert matter if the chemical school assimilated the 
physician to a vintner or brewer the mechanical physio 
logists made him an hydraulic engineer and in fact 
several of the iatromathematicians were at the same time 
teachers of engineering and of medicine 

several of the reasoners of this school combined chcr 
inical with their mechanical principles but it would 
throw jio additional light upon the subject to give any 
account of these and i shall therefore go on to sjieak of 
the next form of the attempt to explain the processes of 
life

sect iv the vitalfluid school — i speak here not 
of tlat opinion which assumes some kind of fluid or 
ether as the means of communication along the nerves in 
particular but of the hypothesis that all the peculiar 
functions of life depend upon some subtle ethereal sub 
stance diffused through the frame — not of a nervous 
fluid but of a vital fluid again i distinguish this 
opinion from the doctrine of an immaterial vital power or 
principle an animal soul which will be the subject of the 
next section nor is this distinction insignificant for a 
material element however subtle however much spiritual 
ized must still act everywhere according to the same 
laws whereas we do not conceive an immaterial spirit 
or soul to be subject to this necessity 

the iatromathematical school could explain to their 
own satisfaction how motions once begun were trans 
ferred and modified but in many organs of the living 
frame there seemed to be a power of beginning motion 
which is beyond all mere mechanical action tliis led to 
the assumption of a principle of a higher kind though 
still material such a principle was asserted by frederick 
hoffinan who was bom at halle in and became 
professor of medicine at the newlyestablished university 
there in according to himf the reason of the 
greater activity of organized bodies lies in the influence 
of a material substance of extreme subtilty volatility 
and energy this is he holds no other than the ether 
which diffused through all nature produces in plants the 
bud the secretion and motion of the juices and is 
separated from the blood and lodged in the brain of 
animals from this acting through the nerves must 
be derived all the actions of the organs in the animal 
frame for when the influence of the nerve upon the 
snuscle ceases muscular motion ceases also

the mode of operation of this yital fluid was how 
ever by no means steadily apprehended by hoflhiann 
and hi followers its operations are so far mechanical 
that all effects are reduced to motion yet they cannot be 
explained according to known mechanical laws at one 
time the effects are said to take place according to laws 
of a higher mechanics which are still to be disco veedf 
at another time in complete contradiction of the general 
spirit of the system metaphysical conceptions are intro 
doced each particle of the vital fluid is said to have a 
determined idea of the whole mechanism and organism 
and according to this it forms the body and preserves it 
by its motion by means of this fluid the soul operates 
upon the body and the instincts and the passions have 
their source in this material sensitive soul this attribu 
tion of ideas to the particles of the fluid is less unaccount 
able when we recollect that something of the same kind 
is admitted into leibnitzs system whose monads have 
also ideas 

notwithstanding its inconsistencies hoffmans system 
was received with very general favour both in germany 
and in the rest of europe the more so inasmuch as it 
fell in very well with the philosophy both of leibnitz 
and of newton the newtonians were generally inclined 
to identify the vital fluid with the ether of which their 
master was so strongly disposed to assume the existence 
and indeed he himself suggested this identification 

when the discoveries made respecting electricity in 
the course of the eighteenth century had familiarized 
men with the notion of a pervading subtle agent invi 
sible intangible yet producing very powerful effects in 
every part of nature physiologists also caught at the sug 
gestion of such an agent and tried by borrowing or 
imitating it to aid the imperfection of their notions ol

the vital powers the vital principle was imagined to 
be a substance of the same kind by some to be the same 
substance with the electric fluid by its agency all 
these processes in organized bodies were accounted for 
which cannot be explained by mechanical or chemical 
laws as the secretion of various matters tears milk 
bije c from an homogeneous fluid the blood the 
production of animal heat digestion and the like 
according to john hunter this attenuated substance 
pervaded the blood itself as well as the solid organic 
frame and the changes which take place in the blood 
which has flowed out of the veins into a basin are ex 
plained by saying that it is for a time till this vital fluid 
evaporates truly alive 

the notion of a vital fluid appears also to be favour 
ably looked upon by cuvier although with him this 
doctrine is mainly put forwards in the form of a nervous 
fluid yet in the following passage he extends the 
operation of such an agent to all the vital functions f 
 we have only to suppose that all the medullary and 
nervous parts produce the nervous agent and that they 
alone conduct it that is that it cto only be transmitted 
by them and that it is changed or consumed by their ac 
tions then everything appears simple a detached por 
tion of muscle preserves for some time its irritability on 
account of the portion of nerve which always adheres to it 
the sensibility and the irritability reciprocally exhfiust each 
other by their exercise because they change or consumet 
the same agent all the interior motions of digestion 
secretion excretion participate in this exhaustion or may 
produce it all local excitation of the nerves brings

bilitj by augmenting the production of the nervous agent 
hence the pleasures of titillations the pains of inflame 
mation the particular sensations increase in the same 
aianner and by the same causes and the imagination 
exercises still by means of the nerves upon the internal 
fibres of the arteries or other parts and through them on 
the sensations an action analogous to that of the will 
upon the voluntary motions as each exterior sense is 
exclusively disposed to admit the substances which it is 
to perceive so each interior organ secretory or other is 
also more excitable by some one agent than by another 
and hence arises what has been called the proper sensi 
hility or proper life of the organs and the influence of 
specifics which introduced into the general circulation 
affect only certain parts in fine if the nervous agent 
cannot become sensible to us the reason is that all sensa 
tion requires that this agent should be altered in some 
way or other and it cannot alter itself 

 such is the summary idea which we may at present 
form of the mutual and general working of the vital 
powers in animals 

against the doctrine of a vital fluid as one uniform 
material agent pervading the organic frame an argument 
has been stated which pointy out extremely well the 
philosophical objection to such an hypothesis if the 
vital principle be the same in all parts of the body how 
does it happen it is asked that the secretions are so 
afferent f how do the particles in the blood separated 
irom their old compounds and united into new ones 
under the same influence give origia to all the different 
fluids which are produced by the glands the liver 
secretes bile the lacrymal gland tears and so on is the 
vital principle different in all these organs to assert 
this is to multiply nominal principles without limit and

without any advance in the explanation of facts is the 
yital principle the same bat its operation modified by 
the structure of the organ we have then two unknown 
causes the vital principle and the organic structure to 
account for the eflfect by such a multiplication of 
hypotheses nothing is gained we may as well say at 
once that the structure of the organ acting by laws yet 
unknown is the cause of the peculiar secretion it is 
as easy to imagine this structure acting to produce the 
whole effect as it is to imagine it modifying the activity 
of another agent thus the hyjjothesis of the vital fluid in 
this form explains nothing and does not in any way help 
onwards the progress of real biological knowledge 

the hypothesis of an immaterial vital principle must 
now be considered 

sect v the psychical school — the doctrine of an 
animal soul as the principle which makes the operations 
of organic different from those of inorganic matter is quite 
distinct from and we may say independent of the 
doctrine of the soul as the intelligent moral responsible 
part of mans nature it is the former doctrine alone of 
which we have here to speak and those who thus hold 
the existence of an immaterial agent as the cause of the 
phenomena of life i term the psychical school 

such a view of the constitution of living things is 
very ancient for instance aristotles treatise o the 
soidi goes entirely upon the supposition that the soul is 
the cause of motion and he arrives at the conclusion that 
ere are different parts in the soul the ntdritive or 
vegetative the sensitive and the rational 

but this doctrine is more instructive to us when it 
appears as the antagonist of other opinions concerning 
the nature of life in this form it comes before us as 
promulgated by stahl whom we have already noticed as

 philosopht of biology 

one of the great discoverers in chemistry bom in the 
same year as hoffman and appointed at his suggestion 
professor at the same time in the same new university of 
halle he soon published a rival physiological theory in 
a letter to lucas schrock the president of the academy 
of naturalists he describes the manner in which he was 
led to form a system for himself educated in the 
tenets of sylvius and willis according to which all dis 
eases are derived from the acidity of the fluids stahl when 
a young student often wondered how these fluids so liable 
to be polluted and corrupted are so wonderfully preserved 
through innumerable external influences and seem to be 
far less affected by these than by age constitution pas 
sion no material cause could he thought pnduce such 
effects no attention to mechanism or chemistry alone 
could teach us the true nature and laws of organisation 
so far as stahl recognised the influence in living 
bodies of something beyond the range of mechanics and 
chemistry there can be no doubt of the sound philosophy 
of his views but when hei proceeds to found a positive 
item of physiology his tenets become more precarious 
the basis of his theory is thisf the body has as body 
no power to move itself and must always be put in 
motion by immaterial substances all motion is a spi 
ritual actj the source of all activity in the oiffanic 
body from which its preservation the permanency of its 
oomposition and all its other functions proceed is an 
immaterial being which stahl calls the soul because 
as he says when the effects are so similar he will not 
multiply powers without necessity of this principle he 
says as the hippocratians said of nature that it does 
without teaching what it ought to do j and does it

interpreta in such a manner that eyen the involuntary 
motions proceed from the soul though without reflection 
or clear consciousness it is indeed evident that there 
are many customary motions and sensations which are 
perfectly rational yet not the objects of distinct conscious 
ness and thus instinctive motions and those of which 
we are quite unconscious may still be connected with 
reason tbe questions which in this view offer themselves 
as how the soul passes from the mother to the childi 
be dismisses as unprofitable he considers nutrition 
and secretion as the work of the soul the corpuscular 
theory and the doctrine of animal spirits are he rightly 
observes mere hypotheses which are arbitrary in their 
character and only shift the difficult for if the ani 
mal spirits are not matter how can they explain the 
action of an immaterial substance on the body and if 
they are matter how are they themselves acted on 

this doctrine of the action of the soul on the body 
was accepted by many persons especially by the iatro 
mathematicians who could not but feel the insufficiency 
of their system without some such supplement such 
were cbeyne and mead in germany stahls disciples 
in physiology were for the most part inconsiderable per 
sonsf several englishmen who speculated concerning 
the metaphysics as well as the physiology of sensation 
and motion inclined to this psychical view as porterfield 
and whytt among the french boissier de sauvageii 
was the most zealous defender of the stahlian system

trolled by it as the starting from fear or the trembling 
at danger unzer a physician at altona was also a 
philosophical stahlianf 

we need not dwell on the opposition which was 
offered to this theory first by hoffman and afterwards 
by haller the former of these had promulgated as we 
have seen the rival theory of a nervous fluid the latter 
was the principal assertor of the doctrine of irritability 
an important theory on which we may afterwards have to 
touch hallers animosity against the stahlian hypothesis 
is a remarkable feature in one who is in general so tole 
rant in his judgment of opinions his arguments are 
taken from the absence of the control of the will over 
the vital actions from the want of consciousness accom 
panying these actions from the uniformity of them in dif 
ferent conditions of the mind and from the small sensi 
bility of the heart which is the source of the vital actions 
these objections and the too decided distinction which 
haller made between voluntary and involuntary muscles 
were very satisfactorily answered by whytt and platner 
in particular it was urged that the instinctive actions of 
brutes are inexplicable by means of mechanism and may 
be compared with the necessary vital actions of the 
human body neither kind are accidental neither kind 
are voluntary both are performed without reflection 

without tracing further the progress of the psychical 
doctrine i shall borrow a few reflections upon it from 
sprengelt — 

 when the opponents of the stahlian system repeat 
incessantly that the assumption of a psychical cause in 
corporeal effects is a metaphysical speculation which does 
not belong to medicine they talk to no purpose the 
states of the soul are objects of our internal experience 
and interest the physician too nearly to allow him to

nee them the innumerable upcotiscious tefforts of 
the soul the powerful and daily effects of the passions 
upon the body too often put to confusion those who 
would expel into the region of metaphysics the disposi 
tions of the mind the connexion of our knowledge of 
the soul as gathered from experience with our know 
ledge of the human body is far closer than the mecha 
nical and chemical physiologists suspect 

the strongest objection against the psychical sys 
tem and one which has never been sufficiently answered 
by any of its advocates is the universality of organic 
effects in the vegetable kingdom the comparison of 
the physiology of plants with the physiology of animals 
puts the latter in its true light without absolutely 
trihing with the word satdy we cannot possibly derive 
from a soul the organic operations of vegetables but 
just as little can we as some stahlians have done draw 
a sharp line between plants and animals and ascribe the 
processes of the former to mere mechanism while we 
derive the operations of the latter from an intellectual 
principle not to mention that such a line is not pos 
sible the rise of the sap and the alteration of the fluids 
of plants cannot be derived entirely from material causes 
as their highest origin 

thus i may add this psychical theory however diffi 
cult to defend in its detail does in its generalities express 
some importent truths respecting the vital powers it 
not only like the last theory gives unity to the living 
body but it marks more clearly than any other theory 
the wide interval which separates mechanical and che 
mical from vital action and fixes our attention upon the 
new powers which the consideration of life compels us to 
assume it not only reminds us that these powers are 
elevated above the known laws of the material world but 
also that they are closely connected with the world of

ihought and feeling with il and reason and thus it 
carries tis in a manner in which none of the preceding 
theories have done to a true conception of a living 
conscious sentient active individual 

at the same time we cannot but allow that the life 
of plants and of the lower orders of animals shows us very 
clearly that in order to arrive at any sound and consistent 
knowledge respecting life we must form some conception 
of it from which all the higher attributes which the term 
• soul involves are utterly and carefully excluded and 
therefoie we cannot but come to the conclusion that the 
psychical school are right mainly in this that in ascrib 
ing the functions of life to a soul they mark strongly and 
justly the impossibility of ascribing them to any known 
attributes of body 



chapter iii 
attempts to analyse the idea op life 

 definitions of life — we have seen in the pre 
ceding chapter that all attempts to obtain a distinct con 
ception of the nature of life in general have ended in 
failure and produced nothing beyond a negative result 
and the conjecture may now naturally occur that the 
cause of this failure resides in an erroneous mode of pro 
pounding to ourselves the problem instead of contem 
plating life as a single idea it may perhaps be proper to 
separate it into several component notions instead of 
seeking for one cause of all vital operations it may be 
well to look at the separate vital functions and to seek 
their causes when the view of this possibility opens 
upon us how shall we endeavour to verify it and to 
take advantage of it f

attempts to analyse thb idba of life 

let us as one obvious oourse take some of the 
attetnpts vhich have been made to define life and let uft 
see whether they appear to offer to us any analysis of the 
idea into component parts such definitions when they 
proceed from men of philosophical minds are the ulti 
mate result of a long course of thought and observation 
and by no means deserve to be slighted as arbitrary selec 
tions of conditions or empty forms of words 

 life has been defined by stahl the con 
dition by which a body resists a natural tendency to che 
mical changes such as putrefaction in like manner 
m von humboldt t defines living bodies to be those 
which notwithstanding the constant operation of causes 
tending to change their form are hindered by a certain 
inward power from undergoing such change the first 
of these definitions amounts only to the assertion that 
vital processes are not chemical a negative result which 
we may accept as true but which is as we have seen a 
barren truth the second appears to be in its import 
identical with the first an inward principle can only 
be understood as distinguished from known external 
powers such as mechanical and chemical agencies or 
if by an internal principle we mean such a principle as 
that of which we are conscious within ourselves we 
ascribe a soul to all living things an hypothesis which 
we have seen is not more efifective than the former in 
promoting the progress of biological science nearly th 
same criticism applies to such definitions as that of kant t 
that life is an internal faculty producing change 
motion and action 

other definitions refer us not to some property 
residing in the whole of an organized mass but to the 
connexion and relation of its parts thus m von hum

boldt has given another definition of a living body 
that it is a whole whose parts arbitrarily separated no 
longer resist chemical changes but this additional 
assertion concerning the parts adds nothing of any value 
to the definition of the whole and in some of the lower 
kinds of plants and animals it is hardly true as a fact 

 another definition f places the character of life in 
motions serviceable to the body moved to this it 
has been objected that on this definition the earth and 
the planets are living bodies perhaps it would be more 
philosophical to object to the introduction of so loose a 
notion as that of a property being serviceable to a body 
we might also add that if we speak of all vital func 
tions as fnotions we make an assumption quite unautho 
rized and probably false 

other definitions refer the idea of life to the idea of 
organization life is the activity of matter according 
to laws of organization we are then naturally led to 
ask what is organization in reply to this is given us 
the kantian definition of organization which i have 
already quoted elsewhere an organized product of 
nature is that in which all the parts are mutually ends 
and means that this definition involves exact fun 
damental ideas and is capable of being made the basis of 
sound knowledge i shall hereafter endeavour to show 
but i may observe that such a definition leads us some 
what further if the parts of organized bodies are known 
to be means to certain ends this must be known because 
they fulfil these ends and produce certain effects by the 
operation of a certain cause or causes the question then

attempts to analyse the idea op life 

recqi what is the cause which produces such effects as 
take place in organized or living bodies and this is iden 
tical with the problem of which in the last chapter we 
traced the history and related the failure of physiologists 
in all attempts at its solution 

 but what has been just said suggests to us 
that it may be an improvement to put our problem in 
another shape not to take for granted that the cause 
of all vital processes is one but to suppose that there 
may be several separate causes at work in a living body 
if this be so life is no longer one kind of activity but 
several we have a number of operations which are 
sonhow bound together and life is the totality df dl 
the in shoirt life is not one function but a system of 
functions 

 we are thus brought very near to the celebrated 
dnition of life given by bichat life is the sum of 
the functions by which death is resisted but upon the 
definition thus stated we may venture to observe — first 
that the introduction of the notion of death in order to 
define the notion of life appears to be unphilosophical 
we may more naturally define death with reference to 
life as the cessation of life or at least we may consider 
life and death as correlative and interdependent notions 
again the word sum used in the way in which it here 
occurs appears to be likely to convey an erroneous con 
ception as if the functions here spoken of were simply 
added to each other and connected by coeistence it 
is plain that our idea of life involves more than this the 
functions are all clearly connected and mutually depend 
on each other nutrition circulation locomotion repro 
duction each has its influence upon all the others 
these functions not merely coexist but exist with many 
mutual relations and connexions they are continued j

as to form not merely a sum but a system and thus 
we are led to modify bichats definition and to say that 
life is the system of vital functions 

 but it will be objected that by such a definition 
we explain nothing the notion of vital functions it may 
be saidj intolves the idea of life and thus brings us round 
again to our starting point or if not at least it is as 
necessary to define vital functions as to define life itself 
so that we have made little progress in our task 

to this we reply that if any one seeks upon such 
subjects some ultimate and independent definition from 
which he can by mere reasoning deduce a series of con 
clusions he seeks that which cannot be found in the 
inductiye sciences a definition does not form the basis 
of reasoning but points out the course of investigation 
e ofinition must include words and the meaning of 
these words must be sought in the progress and results 
of observations as i have elsewhere said the meaning 
of words is to be sought in the progress of thought the 
hiiory of science is our dictionary the steps of scientific 
induction are our definitions it will appear i think 
that it is more easy for us to form an idea of a separate 
function of the animal frame as nutrition or reproduc 
tion than to comprehend life in general tmder any single 
idea and when we say that life is a system of vital 
functions we are of course directed to study these fiinc 
tions separately and as in all other subjects of scientific 
research to endeavour to form of them such clear and 
definite ideas as may enable us to discover their laws 

 the view to which we are thus led of the most 
promising mode of conducting the researches of biology 
la one which the greatest and most philosophical physio 
logists of modem times have adopted thus cuvier 
considers this as the true office of physiology at present

attebipta to anaiiysb the idea op life 

 it belongs to modern times he says to fonn a just 
elassification of the vital phenomena the task of the 
present time is to analyse the forces which belong to 
each organic element and upon the zeal and activity 
jvhieh are given to this task depends according to my 
judgment the fortune of physiology this classifica 
tion of the phenomena of life involves of course a dift 
tinetion and arrangement of the vital functions and the 
investigation of the powers by which these functions ar 
carried on is a natural sequel to such a classification 

 clamjications of functions — attempts to elaesify 
the vital functions of man were made at an early period 
and have been repeated in great number up to modern 
times the task of classification is exposed to the same 
difficulties apd governed by the same conditions in this 
as in other subjects here as in the case of other things 
there may be many classifications which are moderately 
good and natural but there is only one which is the best 
and the true natural system here as in other cases 
one classification brings into view one set of relations 
another another and each may be valuable for its spe 
cial purpose here as in other cases the classes may be 
well constituted though the boundary lines which divide 
them be somewhat indistinct and the order doubtful 
here as in other cases we may have approached to the 
natural classification without having attained it and hero 
as in other caes to define our classes is the last and 
hardest of our problems 

the most ancient classification of the functions of 
living thingsf is the division of them into vital natural 
and animal the vital functions are those which can

functions are those which without the intervention of 
 the will operate on their proper occasions to preserve 
the bodies of animak they are digesuonf absorption 
nutrition to which was added generation the animal 
functions are those which involve perception and will 
•by which the animal is distinguished from the vegetable 
•they are sensimlity locomotion and voice 

the two great grounds of this division the distinction 
of functions which operate continually and those which 
operate occasionally and again the distinction of func 
tions which involve sensation and voluntary motion from 
those which do not are really of fundamental import 
ance and gave a real value to this classification it 
was however liable to obvious objections namely jptvt 
that the names of the classes were ill chosen for all the 
junctions are natural all are vital second that the 
lines of demarcation between the classes are obscure and 
vague respiration is a fital function as being continu 
ally necessary to life but it is also a natural function 
since it concurs in the formation of the nutritive fluid 
•and an animal function since it depends in part on the 
will but these objections were not fatal for a classi 
£cation may be really sound and philosophical though 
its boimdary lines are vague and its nomenclature ill 
selected the division of the functions we have men 
tioned kept its ground long or was employed with a 
subdivision of one class so as to make them four the 
vitals natural animal and sewual functions 

 i pass over many intermediate attempts to clas 
sify the functions and proceed to that of bichat as that 
which is i believe the one most generally assented to in 
modern times the leading principle in the scheme of 
this celebrated physiologist is the distinction between 
organic and animal life this separation is nearly iden 
tical with the one just noticed between the vital and

attempts to analyse the idea of life 

animal functions bnt bichat by the contrasts which he 
pointed out between these classes of fiinctions gave a 
decided prominence and permanence to the distinction 
the organic life which in animals is analogous to the 
life of vegetables and the animal life which implies 
sensation and voluntary motion have each its system of 
organs the centre of the animal life is the brain of the 
organic life the heart the former is carried on by a 
symmetrical the latter by an unsymmetrical system of 
organs the former produces intermitting the latter con 
tinuous actions and in addition to these other differ 
ences are pointed out this distinction of the two lives 
being thus established each is subdivided into two orders 
of functions the animal functions are passive as 
sensation or active as locomotion and voice again the 
organic functions are those of composition which are 
concerned in taking matter into the system digestion 
absorption respiration circulation assimilation and 
those of decomposition which reject the materials when 
they have discharged their office in the system and these 
are again absorption circulation and secretion to these 
are added calorification or the production of animal heat 
it appears from what has been said that absorption and 
circulation and we may add assimilation and secretion 
which are difficult to separate belong alike to the pro 
cesses of composition and decomposition nor in truth 
can we with any rigour separate the centripetal and 
centrifugal movements in that vortex which as we iall 
see is an apt image of organic life 

several objections have been made to this classifica 
tion and in particular to the terms thus employed it 
has been asserts to be a perversion of language to ascribe 
to animals tuh lives and to call the higher faculties in 
man perception and volition the animal iimctions but 
as we have already said when a classification is really

good such objections which bear only upon the mode id 
which it is presented are by no means fatal and it i 
generally acknowledged by all the most philosophical 
cultivators of biology that this arrangement of the func 
tions is better suited to the purposes of the science than 
those which preceded it 

 but according to the principles which we havd 
already laid down the solidity of such classification id 
to be verified by its serving as a useful guide in biological 
researched if the arrangement which we hate explained 
be really founded in natural relations it vnll be found that 
in proportion as physiologists have studied the separate 
functions above enumerated their ideas of these functions 
and of the powers by which they are carried on have 
become more and more clear— have tended more and 
more to the character of exact and rigorous science 

to examine how ftir this has been the case with 
lgard to all the separate functions would be to attempt 
to estimate the vttlue of all the principal physiological 
speculations of modem times — a task far too vast and 
too arduous for any one to undertake who has not devoted 
his life to such studies but it may properly come withitil 
the compass of our present plan to shew how with regard 
to the broader lines of the above classification there has 
been such a progress as we have above described from 
more loose and inaccurate notions of some of the vital 
functions to more definite and precise ideas this i

and secretion 

sect i course of biological research 

 it is to be observed that at present i do not speak 
of the progress of our knowledge with regard to the de 
tail of the processes which take place in the htiman body 
but of the approach made to some distinct idea of the 
specially vital part of each process in the history of 
physiology it has been seen that all the great discoveries 
made respecting the organs and motions of the animal 
frame have been followed by speculations and hypotheses 
connected with such discoveries the discovery of the 
circulation of the blood led to theories of animal heat 
the discovery of the motion of the chyle led to theories 
of digestion the close examination of the process of re 
production in plants and animals led to theories of gne 
ration in all these cases the discovery brought to light 
some portion of the process which was mechanical of 
chemical but it also in each instance served to show 
that the process was something more than inechanical ot 
chemical the theory attempted to explain the process 
by the application of known causes but there always 
remained some part of it which must unavoidably be 
referred to an tmknown cause but though unknown 
such a cause was not a hopeless object of study a the 
vital functions became better and better understood it 
was seen more and more clearly at what precise points of 
the process it was necessary to assume a peculiar vital 
energy and what sort of properties this energy must be 
conceived to possess it was perceived where art hat

manner in what degree mechanical and chemical agen 
cies were modified overruled or counteracted by agencies 
which must be hypermechanical and hyperchemical 
and thus the discoveries made in anatomy by a laborious 
examination of facts pointed out the necessity of intro 
ducing new ideas in order that the facts might be intel 
ligible observation taught much and among other 
things she taught that there was something which could 
not be observed but which must if possible be con 
ceived i shall notice a few instances of this 

sect ii attempts to form a distinct conception of 
assimilation and secretion 

 the ancients — that plants and animals grow by 
taking into their substance matter previously extraneous 
is obvious to all but as soon as we attempt to conceive 
this process distinctly in detail we find that it involves 
no inconsiderable mystery how does the same food 
become blood and flesh bone and hair perhaps the 
earliest attempt to explain this mystery is that recorded 
by lucretius as the opinion of anaxagoras that food 
contains some bony some fleshy particles some of blood 
and so on we might on this supposition conceive that 
the mechanism of the body appropriates each kind of 
particle to its suitable place 

but it is easy to refute this essay at philosophizing 
as lucretius refutes it by remarking that we do not 
find milk in grass or blood in fruit though such food 
gives such products in cattle and in men in opposition 
to this homoiomereia the opinion that is forced upon 
us by the facts is that the process of nutrition is not a 
selection merely but an assimilation the organized sys 
tem does not find but make the additions to its structure 

 buffbn — this notion of assimilation may be vari 
ously expressed and illustrated and all that we can do

attempts to form ideas op separate vital forces 

here in order to show the progress of thought is to ad 
duce the speculations of those writers who have been most 
successful in seizing and marking its peculiar character 
buffon may be taken as an example of the philosophy of 
his time on this subject the body of the animal 
says he is a kind of interior mould in which the 
matter subservient to its increase is modelled and 
assimilated to the whole in such a way that without 
occasioning any change in the order and proportion of 
the parts there results an augmentation in each part 
taken separately this increase this development if we 
would have a clear idea of it how can we obtain it except 
by considering the body of the animal and each of the 
parts which is to be developed as so many interior moulds 
which only receive the accessory matter in the order 
which results from the position of all their parts this 
development cannot take place as persons sometimes 
persuade themselves by an addition to the outside on 
the contrary it goes on by an intimate susception which 
penetrates the mass for in the part thus developed the 
size increases in all parts proportionally so that the new 
matter must penetrate it in all its dimensions and it is 
quite necessary that this penetration of substance must 
take place in a certain order and according to a certain 
measure for if this were not so some parts would de 
velope themselves more than others now what can 
there be which shall prescribe such a rule to the acces 
sory matter except the interior motddf 

to speak of a mould simply would convey a coarse 
mechanical notion which could not be received as any 
useful contribution to physiological speculation but 
this interior mould is of course to be understood figura 
tively not as an assemblage of cavities but as a collec 
tion of laws shaping directing and modifying the new

 philosophy op biology 

•matter giving it not only form but motion and activit 
mich as belong to the parts of an organic being 

 it must be allowed however that even with this 
explanation the comparison is very loose and insufficient 
a mould may be permitted to mean a collection of laws 
but still it can convey no conception except that of laws 
regulated by relations of space and such a conception is 
very plainly quite inadequate to the purpose what can 
we conceive of the interior mould by which chyle is sepa 
rated from the aliments at the pores of the lacteals or 
tears secreted in the lacrymatory gland 

an additional objection to this mode of expression of 
buffbn is that it suggests to us only a single marked 
change in the assimilated matter not a continuous series 
of changes yet the animal fluids and other substances 
are in ffect undergoing a constant series of changes 
food becomes chyme and chyme becomes chyle chyle 
is poured into the blood from the blood secretions take 
place as the bile the bile is poured into the digestive 
canal and a portion of the matter previously introduced 
is rejected out of the system here we must have a 
series of interior moulds and these must imprest 
matter at its ejection from the organic system as well as 
at its reception but moreover it is probable that none 
of the above transformations are quite abrupt change 
is going on between the beginning and the end of each 
stage of the nutritive circulation to express the laws 
of this continuous change the image of an interior mould 
is quite unsuited we must seek a better mode of 
isonception 

 vegetable and animal nutrition is as we have 
sitid a constant circulation the matter so assumed is 
not all retained a perpetual subtraction accompanies a 
lerpetual ikddition there is an excretion as well as an 
intussusception th matter which is assumed by the

living creature is retained only for a while and is then 
parted with the individual is the same but its partd 
are in a perpetual flux they come and go for a time 
the matter which belougs to the organic body is bound 
to it by certain lavrs but before it is thus bound and 
after it is loose this matter may circulate about the unu 
yeroe in any other form life consists in a permanent 
influence over a perpetually changing set of particles 

 cuvier — this condition also has been happily ex 
pressed by means of a comparison by another great 
naturalist if says cuvier if in order to obtain a 
just idea of the essence of life we consider it in the 
beings where its effects are most simple we shall soon 
perceive that it consists in the faculty which belongs to 
certain bodily combinations to continue during a deter 
minate time under a determinate form constantly attract 
ing into their composition a part of the surrounding 
substances and giving up in return some part of tbeif 
own substance 

 life is tiius a vortmy more or less rapid more or less 
complex which has a constant direction and which alwayid 
carries along its stieam particles of the same kinds but 
in which the individual particles are constantly enter 
ing in and departing out so that the jorm of the living 
body is more essential to it than its matter 

 so long as this motion subsists the body in which 
it takes place is auve it lives when the motion stops 
finally the body dies after death the elements whloli 
compose the body given up to the ordinary chemical 
affinities soon separate and the body which was alive is 
dissolved 

this notion of a vortex f which is permanent while

 philosophy of biology 

the matter which composes it constantly changes — of pe 
culiar forces which act in this vortex so long as it exists 
and which give place to chemical forces when the circu 
latory motion ceases — appears to express some of the 
leading conditions of the assimilative power of living 
things in a simple and general manner and thus tends 
to give distinctness to the notion of this vital function 

 but we may observe that this notion of a vortex 
is still insufficient particles are not only taken into the 
system and circulated through it for a time but as we 
have seen they are altered in character in a manner to 
us unintelligible both at their first admission into the 
system and at every period of their progress through it 
in the vortex each particle is constantly transformed 
while it whirls 

it may be said perhaps that this transformation may 
be conceived to be merely a fiew arrangement of particles 
and that thus all the changes which take place in the 
circulating substances are merely so many additional 
windings in the course of the whirling current but to 
say this is to take for granted the atomic hypothesis in 
its rudest form what right have we to assume that 
blood and tears bile and milk consist of like particles of 
matter differently arranged what can arrangement a 
mere relation of space do towards explaining such differ 
ences is not the insufficiency the absurdity of such 
an assumption proved by the whole course of science 
are not even chemical changes according to the best 
views hitherto obtained something more than a mere 
pew arrangement of particles and are not vital as 
much beyond chemical as chemical are beyond geome

attempts to form ideas of separate vital forces 

trical modifications it is not enough then to conceive 
life as a vortex the particles which are taken into the 
organic frame do more than circulate there they are 
at every point of their circulation acted upon by laws of 
an unknown kind changing the nature of the substance 
which they compose life is a vortex in which vital 
forces act at every point of the stream it is not only a 
current of whirling matter but a cycle of recurring 
powers 

 matter and fwm — this image of a vortex is 
closely connected with the representation of life offered 
us by writers of a very different school in schellinqs 
lectures on academic study he takes a survey of the 
various branches of human knowledge determining ac 
cording to his own principles the shape which each science 
must necessarily assume the peculiar character of orga 
nization according to him is that the matter is only an 
accident of the thing itself and the organization consists 
in form alone but this form by its very opposition to 
matter ceases to be independent of it and is only ideally 
separable in organization therefore substance and 
accident matter and form are completely identical f 
this notion that in organization the form is essential and 
the matter accidental or in other words that the form is 
permanent and the matter fluctuating and transitory 
agrees if taken in the grossest sense of matter and form 
with cuviers image of a vortex in a whirlpool or in a 
waterfall the form remains the matter constantly passes 
away and is renewed but we have already seen j that in 
metaphysical speculations in which matter and form are 
 opposed the word form is used in a far more extensive 
sense than that which denotes a relation of space it may

indeed designate any change which matter can undergo 
and we may very allowably say that food and blood are 
the same matter under different forms hence if we 
assert that life is a constant form of circtdating matter we 
express cuviers notion in a mode free from the false 
suggestion which vortex conveys 

 we may however still add something to this 
account of life the circulating parts of the system not 
only circulate but they form the noncirculating parts 
or rather there are no noncirculating parts all por 
tions of the frame circulate more or less rapidly the 
food which we take circulates rapidly in the fluids nlore 
slowly in the flesh still more slowly in the bones but in 
all these parts it is taken into the systein retained there 
for some time and anally replaced by other matter but 
while it remains in the body it exercises upon the other 
circulating parts the powers by which their motion is 
produced nutriment forms and supports the organs 
and the organs carry fresh nutriment to its destination 
the peculiar forces of the living body and its peculiar 
structure are thus connected in an indescribable manner 
the forces produce the structure the structure again 
is requisite for the exertion of the forces the idea of 
an organic or living being includes this peculiar condi 
tion — that its construction and powers are such that it 
constantly appropriates to itself new portions of substance 
which so appropriated become indistinguishable parts of 
the whole and serve to carry on subsequently the same 
functions by which they were assimilated and thus 
organic life is a constant form of circulating matter in which 
the matter and the form determine each other hy peculiar 
laws that w by vital forces

 i have already stated that in our attempts to obtain

attempts to fqbh ipbas of ep abate vital forces 

dear and bcientific ideas of vital forces we have in the 
first place to seek to understand the course of change 
and motion in each function so as to see at what points 
of the process peculiar causes come into play and next 
to endeavour to obtain some insight into the peculiar 
jcharacter and attributes of these causes having spoken 
of the first part of this mode of investigation in regard 
to the general nutrition of organic bodies i must now 
say a few words on the second part 

the forces here spoken of are vital forces from 
what has been said we may see in some measure the dis 
tinction between forces of this kind and mechanical or 
chemical forces the latter tend constantly to produce a 
final condition after which there is no further cause of 
change mechanical forces tend to produce equilibrium 
ihemlcal forces tend to produce composition or decompo 
sition and this point once reached the matter in which 
these forces reside is altogether inert but an organic 
ody tends to a constant motion and the highest activity 
of organic forces shows itself in continuous change 
again in mechanical and chemical forces the force of 
any aggregate is the sum of the forces of all the parts 
the sum of the forces corresponds to the sum of the 
matter but in organic bodies the amount of effect does 
not depend on the matter but on the form the particles 
lose their separate energy in order to share in that of the 
aystem they are not added they are assimilated 

 it is diflscult to say whether anything has been 
ined to science by the various attempts to assign a 
fixed name to the vital force which is thus the immediate 
ause of assimilation it has been called organic attrao 
tian or vital attraction organic affinity or vital affimty 
being thus compared with mechanical attraction or che 
mical aflsnity but perhaps as the process is certainly

priate to it a peculiar name and the name assimilation 
or organic assimilation by the usage of good biological 
writers is generally employed for this purpose and may 
be taken as the standard name of this vital force to 
illustrate this i will quote a passage from the excellent 
elements of physiology of professor miiller in the pro 
cess of nutrition is exemplified the fundamental principle 
of organic assimilation each elementary particle of an 
organ attracts similar particles from the blood and by 
the changes it produces in them causes them to partici 
pate in the vital principle of the organ itself nerves 
take up nervous substance muscles muscular substance 
even morbid structures have the assimilating power 
warts in the skin grow with their own peculiar structure 
in ah ulcer the base and border are nourished in a way 
conformable to the mode of action and secretion deter 
mined by the disease 

 the force of organic assimilation spoken of in the 
last paragraph denotes peculiarly the fone by which each 
organ appropriates to itself a part of the nutriment re 
ceived into the system and thus is maintained and aug 
mented with the growth of the whole but the growth 
of the solid parts is only one portion of the function of 
nutrition besides this we must consider the motion and 
changes of the fluids and must ask what kind of forces 
may be conceived to produce these what are the 
powers by which chyle is absorbed from the food by which 
bile is secreted from the blood by which the circulating 
motion of these and all other fluids of the body are con 
stantly maintained to the questions — what are the 
forces by which absorption secretion and the vital motions 
of fluids are produced — no satisfactory answer has been 
returned yet still some steps have been made which 
it may be instructive to point out 

 in absorption it would appear that a part of the 



digitized by vjooq ic 



attempts to form ideas of separate vital forces 

agency is inorganic for liot only dead membranes but 
inorganic substances absorb fluids and even absorb tliem 
with elective forces according to the ingredients of the 
fluid a force which is of this kind and which hils been 
termed endosmose has been found to produce very curious 
effects when a membrane separates two fluids holding 
in solution different ingredients the fluids pass through 
the membrane in an imperceptible manner and mix or 
exchange their elements the force which produces 
these effects is capable of balancing a very considerable 
pressure it appears moreover to depend at least among 
other causes upon attractions operating between the 
elements of the solids and the fluids as well as between 
the different fluids and this force though thus appa 
rently of a mechanical and chemical nature probably has 
considerable influence in vital phenomena 

 but still though endosmose may account in part 
for absorption in some cases it is certain that there is 
some other vital force at work in this process there 
must be as miiller says an organic attraction of a 
kind hitherto unknown if absorption he addsf is 
to be explained in a manner analogous to the laws of 
endosmose it must be supposed that a chemical affinity 
resulting from the vital process itself is exerted between 
the chyme in the intestines and the chyle in the lacteals 
by which the chyle is enabled to attract the chyme with 
out being itself attracted by it but such affinity or 
attraction would be of a vital nature since it does not 
exist after death 

 if the force of absorption be thus mysterious in 
its nature the force of secretion is still more so in this 
ease we have an organ filled with a fine network of 
bloodvessels and in the cavities of some glandf or open 
part we have a new fluid formed of a kind altogether

different from the blood itself it is easily shown that 
this cannot be explained by any action of pores or capil 
lary tubes but what conception can we form of the 
forces by which such a change is produced here again 
i shall borrow the expressions of miiller as presenting 
the last result of modem physiology he says the 
indre probable supposition is that by virtue of imbibition 
fer the general organic porosity the fluid portion of the 
blood becomes diffiised through the tissue of the secreting 
brgan that the external surface of the glandular canals 
exerts a chemical attraction on the elements of the fluid 
inftising into them at the same time a tendency to unite 
in new combinations and then repels them in a manner 
which is certainly quite inexplicable towards the inner 
fturfe of tjie secreting membrane or glandular canals 
 although quite unsupported by facts he adds this 
theory of attraction and repulsion is not without its ana 
logy in physical phenomena and it would appear that 
very similar powers effect the elimination of the fluid in 
secretion and cause it to be taken up by the lymphatics 
in absorption he elsewhere saysf • absorption seems 
to depend on an attraction the nature of which is un 
known but of which the very counterpart as it were 
takes place in secretion the fluids altered by the se 
creting action being repelled towards the free side or 
open surface only of the secreting membranes and then 
redsed forwards by the successive portions of the fluids 
jbeoreted 

 with regard to the forces which produce the 
motion of absorbed or secreted fluids along their destined 
bourse it may be seen from the last quoted sentence 
that the same vital force which changes the nature also 
produces the movement of the substance the fluids aie 
pressed forwards by the successive portions absorbed or 
secreted that this is the sole cause or at least a very 
 phyihloffy p t lb p

powerfiil cause of the moticm of the nutritive fluids in 
oiganic bodies is easily shown by experience it is found 
that the oins which effect the ascent of the sap in trees 
duf ing the spring wre the terminal parts of the roots 
that the whole force by which the sap is impelled upwards 
is the vis a tergh as it has been called the force pushing 
from behind exerted in the roots and thus the force 
which produces this motion is exerted exactly at those 
points where the organic body selects from the contiguous 
mass those particles which it absorbs and appropriates 
and the same may most probably be taken for the cause 
oi the motion of the lymph and cliyle at least miiller 
saysf that no other motive power has been detected which 
impels those fluids in their course 

thus though we must confess the vital fowe con 
cerned in assimilation and secretion to be unknown in 
its nature we still obtain a view of some of the attributes 
which it involves it has mechanical efficacy producing 
motions often such as would require great mechanical 
force but it exerts at the same point both an attraction 
and a repulsion attracting matter on one side and repel 
ling it on the other and in this circumstance it diflfers 
entirely from mechanical forces again it is not only 
mechanical but chemical producing a complete change 
in the nature of the substance on whidi it acts to which 
we must add that the changes produced by the vital 
forces are such as for the most part our artificial che 
mistry cannot imitate but again by the action of the 
tital force at any point of an organ not only are fluids 
made to pass and changed as they pass but the organ 
itself is maintained nd strengthened so as to continue 
or to increase its operation and thus the vital energy 
supports its activity by its action and is augmented by 
being exerted

we have thus endeavoured to obtain a view of some 
of the peculiar characters which belong to the force of 
organic assimilation — the force by which life is kept up 
conceived in the most elementary form to which we can 
reduce it by observation and contemplation it appears 
that it is a force which not only produces motion and 
chemical change but also vitalizes the matter on which 
it acts giving to it the power of producing like changes 
on other matter and so on indefinitely it not only cir 
culates the particles of matter but puts them in a stream 
of which the flow is development as well as movement 

the force of organic assimilation being thus con 
ceived it becomes instructive to compare it with the force 
concerned in generation which we shall therefore endea 
vour to do 

sect iv attempts to conceive the process of generation 
 at first sight the function of nutrition appears 
very different from the function of generation in the 
former case we have merely the existing organs main 
tained or enlarged and their action continued in the 
latter we have a new individual produced and extricated 
from the parent the term reprodiiction has no doubt 
been applied by different writers to both these func 
tions — to the processes by which an organ when muti 
lated is restored by the forces of the living body and to 
the process by which a new generation of individuals is 
produced which may be considered as taking the place of 
the old generation as these are gradually removed by 
death but these are obviously different senses of the 
word in the latter case the term reproduction is 
figuratively used for the safne indiyiduals are not repro 
duced but the species is kept up by the propagation of 
new individuals as in nutrition the organ is kept up by 
the assimilation of new matter to escape ambiguity i 
shall avoid using the term repvduction in the sense of 
propagation

 in nutrition as we have seen the matter which 
from being at first extraneous is appropriated by the 
living system and directed to the sustentation of the 
organs undergoes a series of changes of which the detail 
eludes our observation and apprehension the nutriment 
which we receive contributes to the growth of flesh and 
bone viscera and organs of sense but we cannot trace 
in its gradual changes a visible preparation for its final 
office the portion of matter which is destined to repair 
the waste of the eye or the skin is not found assuming a 
likeness to the parts of the eye or the structure of the 
skin as it conies near the place where it is moulded into 
its ultimate form the new parts are insinuated among 
the old ones in an obscure and imperceptible matter 
we can trace their progress only by their effects the 
organs are nourished and that is almost all we can learn 
we cannot discover how this is done we cannot follow 
pature through a series of manifest preparations and 
processes to this result 

 in generation the case is quite different the 
youngf being is formed gradually and by a series of dis 
tinguishable processes it is included within the parent 
before it is extruded and approaches more or less to the 
likeness of the parent before it is detached while it 
is still an embryo it shares in the nutriment which circu

is already clear while the new and the old parts in 
every other portion of the mother ire undistioguishably

tinct from the rest of the system and becomes rapidly 
more and more so as the time goes on and thus there

first onlj the development of a part of the organization 
of the mother — of a germ an ovule but it is not 
developed like other organs retaining its general form 
it does not become merely a largier bud a larger ovule 
it is entirely changed it becomes from a bud a blossom 
a flower a fruit a seed from an ovule it becomes an 
eggf a chick a bird or it may be a foetus a child the 
original rudiment is not merely nourished but unfolded 
and transformed through the most marked and remote 
changes gradually tending to the form of the new indi 
vidual 

id but this is not all the faetus is as we have 
said a development of a portion of the mothers organi 
jsation but the foetus supposing it female is a likeness 
of the mother the mother even before conception 
contains within herself the germs of her progeny the 
fomale foetus therefore at a certain stage of develop 
ment will contain also the germs of possible progeny 
and thus we may have the germs of future generations 
preexisting and included snccesisively within one another 
and this state of things which thus suggests itself to us 
as possible is found to be the case in facts which obser 
vation supplies anatomists have traced ovules in the 
unborn foetus and thus we have three generations in 
cluded one iidthin another 

 supposing we were to stop here the process of 
propagation might appear to be altogether different from 
that of nutrition the latter as we have seen may be 
in some measure illustrated by the image of a vwtea 
the former has been represented by the image of a series 
of germs sheathed one within another successively and 
this without any limit this view of the subject has 
been termed the doctrine of the preeanstence of getns

tinschachtelungstheorie descriptive of the successive

sheathing of which i have spoken imitating this term 
we may call it the theory of stwcesme inclusion it hqs 
always had many adherents and has been perhaps up 
to the present time the most current opinion on tbib 
subject of generation cuvier inclines to this opinion 
 fixed forms perpetuating themselves by generation dis 
tinguish the species of living things these forms do 
not produce themselves do not change themselves life 
supposes them to exist already its flame can be lighted 
only in organization previously prepared and thq mort 
profound meditations and the most delicate researches 
terminate alike in the mystery of the preexistence of 
germs 

 yet this doctrine is full of difficulty it is aa 
cuvier says a mysterious view of the subject o mys 
terious that it can hardly be accepted by us who seek 
distinct conceptions as the basis of our philosophy can 
it be true not only that the germ of the offspring is 
originally included in the parent but also the getms of 
its progeny and so on without limit — so that each fruits 
ful individual contains in itself an infinite collection of 
future possible individuals — a reserve of infinite sue 
ceeding generations this is hard to admit have we 
no alternative what is the opposite doctrine 

 the opposite doctrine deserves at least some 
notice it extends to the production of a new individual 
the conception of growth by nutrition according to 
this view we suppose propagation to take place not as in 
the view just spoken of by inclusion afid extrusion but 
by assimilation and development — not by the dnatdrial 
mexistence f germs but by the communication of 
vital forces to new matter this opinion appears to be 
entertained by som of the most eminent physiologists 
of the present time thus miiller says theorganie

force is also creative tlie organic force which resides in 
the whole and on which the existence of each part 
depends has also the property of generating from organic 
matter the parts necessary to the whole life he adds 
is not merely a harmony of the parts on the contrary 
the harmonious action of the parts subsists only by the 
influence of a force pervading all parts of the body 
 this force exists before the harmonizing parts which 
are in fact formed by it during the development of the 
embryo and again the creative force exists in the 
germ and creates in it the essential force of the future 
animal the germ is potmtiauy the whole animal during 
the development of the germ the parts which constitute 
the iactual whole are produced 

 in this view we extend to the reproduction of 
an individual the same conception of organic assimilation 
which we have already arrived at as the best notion we 
can form of the force by which the reproduction and sus 
tentation of parts takes place and is not such an 
extension really very consistent if a living thing can 
appropriate to itself extraneous matter invest it with its 
own functions and thus put it in the stream of constant 
development may we not conceive the development of a 
new whole to take plac in this way as well as of a part 
if the organized being can infuse into new matter its vital 
forces is there any contradiction in supposing this infu 
sion to take place in the full measure which is requisite 
for the production of a new individual the force of 
organic assimilation is transferred to the very matter on 
which it acts it may be transferred so that the operation 
of the forces produces not only an organ but a system of 
organs 

 this identification of the forces which operate 
in nutrition and generation may at first seem forced 
and obscure in consequence of the very strong apparent

differences of the two processes which we have already 
noticed but this defect in the doctrine is remedied by 
the consideration of what may be considered as inter 
mediate cases it is not true that in the nutrition of 
special organs the matter is always conveyed to its ulti 
mate destination without being on its way moulded into 
the form which it is finally to bear as the embryo is 
moulded into the form of the future individual on the 
contrary there are cases in which the waste of the organs 
is supplied by the growth of new ones which are prepared 
and formed before they are used just as the offspring is 
prepared and formed before it is separated from the 
parent this is the case with the teeth of many animals 
and especially with the teeth of animals of the croco 
dile kind young teeth grow near the root of the old 
ones like buds on the stem of a plant and as these 
become fully developed they take the place of the 
parent tooth when that dies and is cast away and 
these new teeth in their turn are succeeded by others 
which germinate from them several generations of 
such teeth it is said as many as four have been detected 
by anatomists visibly existing at the same time just 
as several generations of germs of individuals have been 
as we already stated observed included in one another 
but this case of the teeth appears to show very strikingly 
how insufficient such observations are to establish the 
doctrine of successive inclusion or of the preexistence of 
germs are we tp suppose that every crocodiles tooth 
includes in itself the germs of an infinite number of pos 
sible teeth as in the theory of preexisting germs every 
individual includes an infinite number of individuals if 
this be true of teeth we must suppose that organ to 
follow laws entirely different from almost every other 
organ for no one would apply to the other organs in 
general such a theory of reproduction but if such a

 philosophy of bioloay 

theory be not maintained respecting the teeth how cati 
we maintain the theory of the preexisting germs of indi 
viduals which has no recommendation except that of 
accounting for exactly the same phenomena 

it would seem then that we are by the closest consi 
deration of the subject led to conceive the forces by 
which generation is produced as forces which vitalize 
certain portions of matter and thus prepare them for 
development according to organic forms and thus the 
conception of this generative force is identified with 
the conception of the force of organic assimilation to 
which we were led by the consideration of the process 
of nutrition 

i shall not attempt to give further distinctness and 
fixity to this conception of one of the vital forces but i 
shall proceed to exemplify the same analysis of life by some 
remarks upon another vital process and the forces of 
which it exhibits the operation

 wb formerly noticed the distinctions of wganic 
and animal functions organic and animal forces as one 
of the most marked distinctions to which physiologists 
have been led in their analysis of the vital powers i 
have now taken one of the former the organic class of 
ftinctions namely nutrition and have endeavoured to 
point out in some measure the peculiar nature of the 
vital forces by which this function is carried on it may 
serve to show the extent and the difficulty of this dubjet

attempts to foem ideas of separate vital forces 

if before quitting it i offer a few remarks suggesteil by a 
function belonging to the other class the animal unc 
tions this i shall briefly do with respect to voluntary 
motion 

 in the history of physiology i have already 
related the progress of the researches by which the 
organs employed in voluntary motion became known to 
anatomists it was ascertained to the satisfaction of all 
physiologists that the immediate agents in such motion 
are the muscles that the muscles are in some way con 
tracted when the nerves convey to them the agency of 
th will and that thus the limbs are moved it was 
ascertained also that the nerves convey sensations from 
the organs of sense inwards so as to make these sensa 
tions the object of the animals consciousness in man 
and the higher animals these impressions upon the 
nerves are all conveyed to one internal organ the brain 
and from this organ all impressions of the will appear to 
proceed and thus the brain is the centre of animal life 
towards which sensations converge and from which voli 
tions diverge 

but this being the process we are led to inquire how 
fitr we can obtain any knowledge or form any conception 
of the vital forces by means of which the process is carp 
ried on and here i have further stated in the history 
that the transfer of sensations and volitions along the 
nerves was often represented as consisting in the motion 
of a nervous fluid i have related that the hypothesis of 
such ft fluid conveying its impressions either by motions 
of translation or of vibration was countenanced by many 
great names as newton haller and even cuvier but 
i have ventured to express my doubt whether this hypo 
thesis can have much value for i have said this 
principle cannot be mechanical chemical or physical 
and therefore cannot be better understood by embodying 

 ht fnd sciy iii

 philosophy of biology 

it in a fluid the difficulty we have in conceiving what 
the force w is not got rid of by explaining the machinery 
by which it is transferred 

 i may add that no succeeding biological researches 
appear to have diminished the force of these considera 
tions in modem times attempts have repeatedly been 
made to identify the nervous fluid with electricity or 
galvanism but these attempts have not been satisfac 
tory or conclusive of the truth of such an identity and 
professor miiller probably speaks the judgment of the 
most judicious physiologists when he states it as his 
opinion after examining the evidence that the vital 
actions of the nerves are not attended with the deve 
lopment of any galvanic currents which our instruments 
can detect and that the laws of action of the nervous 
principle are totally different from those of electricity 

that the powers by which the nerves are the instru 
ments of sensation and the muscles of motion are vital 
endowments incapable of being expressed or explained 
by any comparison with mechanical chemical and elec 
trical forces is the result which we should expect to find 
judging from the whole analogy of science and which 
thus is confirmed by the history of physiology up to the 
present time we naturally then turn to inquire 
whether such peculiar vital powers have been brought 
into view with any distinctness and clearness 

 the property by which muscles under proper sti 
mulation contract and produce motion has been termed 
iititability or contractility the property by which nerves 
are susceptible of their appropriate impressions has been 
termed sensibility a very few words on each of these 
subjects must suffice 

irritabilitt — i have in the history of physiologyf 
noticed that glisson a cambridge professor distinguished 
the irritation of muscles as a peculiar property different 

 elem phyi p f w set iii 



digitized by vjooq ic 



attempts to form ideas of sepaeate vital forces 

from any merely mechanical or physical action i have 
mentioned also that he divides irritation into natural 
vital and animal and points out though briefly the 
graduated differences of irritability in different organs 
although these opinions did not at first attract much 
notice about seventy years afterwards attention was 
powerfully called to this vital force irritability by haller 
i shall borrow sprengels reflections on this subject 

 hitherto men had been led to see more and more 
clearly that the cause of the bodily functions the funda 
mental power of the animal frame is not to be sought in 
the mechanism and still less in the mixture of the parts 
in this conviction they had had recourse partly to the 
quite supersensuous principle of the soul partly to the 
halfmaterial principle of the animal spirits in order to 
explain the bodily motions glisson alone saw the 
necessity of assuming an original power in the fibres 
which independent of the influence of the animal spirits 
should produce contraction in them and gorter first 
held that this original power was not to be confined to 
the muscles but to be extended to all parts of the living 
body 

 but as yet the laws of this power were not known 
nor had men come to an understanding whether it were 
fully distinct from the elasticity of the parts or by what 
causes it was put in action they had neither instituted 
observations nor experiments which established its rela 
tion to other assumed forces of the body there was 
still wanting a determination of the peculiar seat of this 
power and experiments to trace its gradual differences 
in different parts of the body in addition to other 
causes the necessity of the assumption of such a power 
was felt the more in consequence of the prevalence of 
leibnitzs doctrine of the activity of matter but it 
was an occult quality and remained so till haller by 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 philosophy op biology 

numerous experiments and solid observations placed in 
a clear light the peculiarities of the powers of the animal 
body 

 perhaps however haller did more in the way of 
determining experimentally the limits and details of the 
application of this idea of irritability as a peculiar attri 
bute than in developing the idea itself in this way his 
merits were great as early as the year he pub 
lished his opinion upon irritability as the cause of mus 
cular motion which he promulgated again in but 
from the year he was more attentive to the pecu 
liarities of irritability and its difference from the effect of 
the nerves in the first edition of his physiology y which 
appeared in he distinguished three kinds of force 
in muscles — the dead force the innate force and the 
nervous power the first is identical with the elastic 
force of dead matter and remains even after death the 
innate force continues only a short time after death and 
discloses itself especially by alternate oscillations the 
motions which arise from this are much more lively than 
those which arise from mere elasticity they are not 
excited by tension nor by pressure nor by any mechai 
nical alteration but only by irritation the nervous 
force of the muscle is imparted to it from without by the 
nerves it preserves the irritability y which cannot long 
subsist without the influence of the nervous force but is 
not identical with it 

in the yefir haller laid before the society of 
gottingen the result of one hundred and ninety experi 
ments from which it appears to what parts of the 
animal system irritability and nervous power belong 
these i need not enumerate he also investigated with 
care its gradations in those parts which do possess it 
thus the heart possesses it in the highest degree and 
other organis follow in their order

attempts to foem ideas of separate vital forces 

 hallers doctrine was that there resides in the 
muscles a peculiar vital power by which they contract 
and that this power is distinct from the attributes of the 
nerves and this doctrine has been accepted by the 
best physiologists of modem times but this distinction 
of the irritability of the muscles from the setmbility of the 
nerves became somewhat clearer by giving to the former 
attribute the name of contractility this accordingly 
•was done it is for example the phraseology used by 
bichat by speaking of animal sensibuity and animal 
thmfyactility the passive and the active element of the 
processes of animal life are cjearly separated and opposed 
to each other the sensations which we feel and the 
muscular action which we exert may be losely and 
inseparably connected yet still they are clearly distin 
guishable we can easily in our apprehension separate 
he titillation felt in the nose on taking snuft from the 
action of the muscles in sneezing or the perception of 
an object falling towards the eye from the exertion which 
shuts the eyeiid although in these cases the passive and 
active part of the process are almost or quite inseparable 
in fact and this clear separation of the active from the 
passive power is something it would seem peculiar to 
the animal vital powers it is a character by which they 
differ not only from mechanical chemical and all other 
merely physical forces but even from organic vital 
powers 

 but this difibrence between the animal and the 
organic vital powers requires to be further insisted upon 
for it appears to have been overlooked or denied by very 
eminent physiologists for instance bichat classifies the 
vital powers as animal sensibility animal contractility 
organic sensibility organic contractility 

now the view which suggests itself to us in agreoi 
ment with what has been said is this — that though ani 
mal sensibility and animal contractility are clearly and 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 philosophy of biology 

certainly distinct organic sensibilityand organic contrac 
tility are neither separable in fact nor in our conception 
but together make up a single vital power that they 
are not separable in fact is indeed acknowledged by 
bichat himself the organic contractility he says 
 can never be separated from the sensibility of the same 
kind the reaction of the excreting tubes is immediately 
connected with the action which the secreted fluids exer 
cise upon them the contraction of the heart must neces 
sarily succeed the influx of the blood into it it is not 
wonderful therefore that it should have happened as he 
complains that authors have by no means separated 
these two things either in their consideration or in lan 
guage we cannot avoid asking are organic sensibility 
and organic contractility really anything more than 
two different aspects of the same thing like action and 
reaction in mechanics which are only two ways of con 
sidering the action which takes place at a point or like 
the positive and negative electricities which as we have 
seen always coexist and correspond to each other 

 but we may observe moreover that bichat by his 
use of the term contractility includes in it powers to 
which it cannot with any propriety be applied why 
should we suppose that the vital powers of absorption 
secretion assimilation are of such a nature that the name 
contractility may be employed to describe them we 
have seen in the last chapter that the most careful study 
of these powers leads us to conceive them in a manner 
altogether removed from any notion of contraction is 
it not then an abuse of language which cannot possibly 
lead to anything but confusion to write thiisf the 
insensible organic contractility is that by virtue of which 
the excreting tubes react upon their respective fluids 
the secreting organs upon the blood which flows into

them the parts where nutrition is performed upon the 
nutritive juices and the lymphatics upon the substances 
which excite their open extremities in the same man 
ner he ascribes to the peculiar sensibility of each organ 
the peculiarity of its products and operations an 
increased absorption is produced by an increased suscep 
tibility of the absorbent orifices and thus in this 
view each organic power may be contemplated either as 
sensibility or as contractility and may be supposed to be 
rendered more intense by magnifying either of these its 
aspects although in fact neither can be conceived to 
be increased without an exactly commensurate increase 
of the other 

 this opinion unfounded as it thus appears to be 
that all the different organic vital powers are merely dif 
ferent kinds of contractility or excitability was connected 
with the doctrines of brown and his followers which 
were so celebrated in the last century that all diseases 
arise from increase or from diminution of the vital force 
the considerations which have already offered themselves 
would lead us to assent to the judgment which cuvier 
has pronounced upon this system the theory of exci 
tation he says so celebrated in these later times by its 
influence upon pathology and therapeutick is at bottom 
only a modification of that in which including under a 
common name sensibility and irritability and we may 
add applying this name to all the vital powers the 
seculator takes refuge in an abstraction so wide that if 
by it he simplifies medicine he annihilates all positive

 liyipg fpre and fhis condition would be satisfied by 
consiering the force as derived from the nervous system 
but it appears that though the nervous system has the 
ipost important influence upon all vital actions the 
musculai irritability must peeds be considered as some 
thinf distinct and thus the irritability or contractility 
pf the njuscje is a peculiar eiowment of the texture but 
it is at the saine time an endowment which can only co

action a straight fibre could bend itself at certain points 
and at certain points only since the elementary force 
must act at every point of the fibre and not at certain 
selected points 

 a circumstance which remarkably marks the 
difference between the vital force of contractility inhe 
rent in muscles and any merely dead or mechanical force 
is this that in assuming their contractile state muscles 
exert a tension which they could not themselves support 
or convey if not strengthened by their vital irritability 
they are capable of raising weights by their exertion 
which will tear them asunder when the power of con 
trieution is lost by death this has induced cuvier and 
other physiologists to believe that in the moment of 
action the particles that compose a fibre not only ap 
proach towards each other longitudinally but that their 
cohesive attraction becomes instantaneously much greater 
than it was before for without such an increase of 
cohesive force the tendency to shorten could not as it 
would appear prevent the fibre from being torn we 
see here the diflsculty or leather the impossibility of con 
ceiving muscular contractility as a mere mechanical force 
and perhaps thre is little hope of any advantage by call 
ing in the aid of chemical hypothesis to solve the mecha 
nical difficulty cuvier conjectures that a sudden change 
in the chemical composition may thus so quickly and 
powerfully augment the cohesion but we may ask are 
not a chemical synthesis and analysis suddenly performed 
by a mere act of the will as difficult to conceive as a 
sudden increase and decrease of mechanical power directly 
produced by the same cause

uties which we ascribe to external objects as a bitter 
taste a sweet odour a shrill sound a red colour a hard 
or a hot object of touh some of these sensations are 
but obscurely the objects of our consciousness as for 
example the feeling which our feet have of the ground 
or the sight which our eyes have of neighbouring objects 
when we walk in a reverie in these cases the sensa 
tions though obscure exist for they serve to balance and 
guide us as we walk in other cases our sensations are 
distinctly and directly the objects of our attention 

but our sensations as we have already said we ascribe 
as qualities to external objects by our senses we perceive 
objects and thus our sensations become perceptions we 
have not only the sensation of round purple and green 
repeated and varied but the perception of a bunch of 
grapes partly ripe and partly unripe we have not only 
sensations of noise and of variouslycoloured specks ra 
pidly changing their places but we have perceptions by 
sound and sight of a stone rolling down the hill and 
crushing the shrubs in its path we scarcely ever dwell 
upon our sensations our thoughts are employed upon 
objects we regard the impressions upon our nerves 
not for what they are but for what they tell us 

but in what language is it that the impressions upon 
the nerves thus speak to us of an external world of the 
forms and qualities and actions of objects how is it 
that by the aid of our nervous system we become ac 
quainted not only with impressions but with things that 
we learn not only the relation of objects to us but to 
one another 

 it has been shown at some length in the previous 
books that the mode in which sensations are connected 
in our minds so as to convey to us the knowledge of 
objects and their relations is by being contemplated with 
reference to ideas our sensations connected by the

idea of space become figures connected by the idea of 
time they become causes and effects connected by the 
idea of resemblance they become individuals and kinds 
cbniiected by the idea of organization they become 
living things it has been shown that without these 
ideas there can be no connexion among our sensations 
ftnd therefore no perception of figure action kind or 
iti stiort of bodies under any aspect whatever sensations 
fcre the rude matter of bur perceptions and are nothing 
except so far as they have foim given them by ideas 
but thus moulded by our ideas sensation becomes the 
source of an endless store of iniportant knowledge of 
fevery possible kind 

 but one of the most obvious uses of our percep 
tions and our knowledge is to direct our actions it is 
suitable to the condition of our being that when ye per 
eive a bunch of grapes we should be able to pluck and 
eat th ripfe ones that when we perceive a stone rushing 
iown the side of a hill we should be able to mote so as td 
avidit and this must be done by moving our limbs 
in short by the use of our muscles and thus sensation 
leads hot directly but through the medium of ideas to 
muscular contraction i say that sensation and muscular 
action are iii siich cases connected through the medium 
of ideas for when we proceed to pluck the grape 
tvhick we see the sensation does not determine the 
motion of the hand by any necessary geometrical or 
mechanical conditions as an impression made upon a 
inachine determines its motions but the perceptiofi leads 
us to stretch forth the hand to that part of space where 
ever it is wtere we know that the grape is and this not in 
any deteriniriate path but it may be avoiding r removing

kind the cause and the eitect are bound together hot 
by physical but by intellectual ties 

 and thus in such cases between the two vital 
operations sensation and muscular action there inter 
venes as an intermediate step perception or knowledge 
which is not merely vital but ideal but this is not all j 
there is still another mental part of the process which may 
be readily distinguished from that which we have de 
scribed an act of the willy a volition is that in the mind 
which immediately determines the action of the muscles 
of the body and thus will intervenes betweeii know 
ledge and action and the cycle of operations whicli takd 
place when animals act with reference to external objects 
is this — sensation ierception volition muscular con 
traction 

 to attempt further to analyse the mental pari oi 
this cycle does not belong to the present part bnt 
work but we may remark here as we hav aiietfdf 
remarked in the history how irresistibly we kte led 
by physiological researches into the domain of thought 
and mirid we pass from the body to ihe soiil from 
physics to metaphysics from biology to psychology 
from things to persons from nouns to pronbims t have 
there noticed the manner in which cuvier expresses this 
transition by the introduction of the pronoun flie 
impression of external objects upon the me the produc 
tion of a sensation of an image is a mystery impene 
trable to our thoughts 

 feut to return to the merely biological part of 
oiif speculations we have arrived it will be perceived 
at this result that in animal actions there intervenes 
betweeri the two terms of sensation and muscular coiir 
traction an intermediate process which inay fed described

 philosophy of biology 

the seat of the sentient and volent faculties and is of a 
hyperphysical nature but the existence of such a centre 
as a necessary element in the functions of the animal life 
is a truth which is important in biology this indeed may 
be taken as the peculiar character of animal as distin 
guished from merely organic powers accordingly it is 
so stated by bichat for although he superfluously as it 
would seem introduces into his list of vital powers an 
organic sensibility he still draws the distinction of which 
i have spoken in the animal life sensibility is the 
faculty of receiving an impression plits that of referring it 
to a common centre 

 but since sensibility and contractility are thus 
connected by reference to a common centre we may ask 
before quitting the subject what are the different forms 
which this reference assumes is the connexion always 
attended by the distinct steps of knowledge and will — by 
a clear act of consciousness as in the case which we 
have taken of plucking a grape or may these steps 
become obscure or vanish altogether 

we need not further illustrate the former connexion 
such actions as we have described are called voluntary 
actions in extreme cases the mental part of the process 
is obvious enough but we may gradually pass from 
these to cases in which the mental operation is more and 
more obscure 

in walking in speaking in eating in breathing our 
muscular exertions are directed by our sensations and 
perceptions yet in such processes how dimly are we 
conscious of perceptive and directive power how the 
mind should be able to exercise such a power and yet 
should be scarcely or not at all conscious of its exercise 
is a very curious problem but in all or in most of the 
above instances the solution of this problem appears to 
 ltfe and deaths p

attempts to form ideas op separate vital forces 

depend upon psychological rather than biological prin 
ciples and therefore does not belong to this place 

 but in cases at the other extreme the mental 
part of the operation vanishes altogether in many 
animals even after decapitation the limbs shrink when 
irritated the motions of the iris are determined by the 
influence of light on our eyes without our being aware 
of the motions here sensations produce motions but 
with no trace of intervening perception or will the 
sensation appears to be reflected back from the central 
element of animal life in the form of a muscular contrac 
tion but in this case the sensation is not modified or 
regulated by any idea these reflected motions have no 
reference to relations of space or force among surround 
ing objects they are blind and involuntary like the 
movements of convulsion depending for direction and 
amount only on the position and circumstances of the 
limb itself with its muscles here the centre from which 
the reflection takes place is merely animal not intellec 
tual 

in this case some physiologists have doubted whether 
the reflection of the sensation in the form of a muscular 
contraction does really take place from the centre and 
have conceived that sensorial impressions might affect 
motor nerves without any communication with the nerv 
ous centre but on this subject we may i conceive 
with safety adopt the decision of professor miiller deli 
berately given after a careful examination of the subject 
• when impressions made by the action of external stimuli 
on sensitive nerves give rise to motions in other parts 
these motions are never the result of the direct reaction 
of the sensitive and motor fibres of the nerves on each 
other the irritation is conveyed by the sensitive fibres 
to the brain and spinal cord and is by these communi 
cated to the motor fibres

 thus we have two extreme cases of the connexiori 
of sensation with muscular action in one of which the 
connexion clearly isy and in the other it as clearly is nou 
determined by relations of ideas iii its transit through 
tlie nervous centre there is another highly curious case 
standing intermediate between these two and extremely 
difficult to refer to either i speak of the case of w 

instinct leads to actions which are such as if tjiey 
were deteimined by ideas the lamb follows its mother 
by instinct but the motions by which it does this the 
special muscular exertions depend entirely upon the 
geornetrical and mechanical relations of external bodies 
as the form of the ground and the force of the wind 
the contractions of the muscles which are requisite in 
order that the creature inay obey its instinct vary with 
every variation of these external conditions — are not 
determined by any rule or necessity but by properties of 
space and force thus the action is not governed by 
sensations directly but by sensations moulded by ideas 
and the same is the case with other cases of instinct 
the dog hunts by instinct but he hunts certain kinds of 
animals merely thus showing that his instinct acts ac 
cording to resemblances and differences he crosses the 
field repeatedly to find the track of his prey by scent 
thus recogtiising the relations of space with reference to 
the track he leaps adjusting his force to the distance 
and height of the leap with mechanical precision and 
thus he practically recognises ihe ideas of reseriiblance 
space and force 

but have animals such ideas lii any proper sense 
in vhich we caii speak of possessing ideas it appeals 
jlain that they have not animals cannot at any time 
be sfeid pfroperly to possess ideas for ideas imply the 
possibility of speculative knowledge

attempts to form ideas of separate vital forces 

 but if we allow to animals the practical posses 
sion of ideas we have still a great diflbculty remaining 
in the case of man his ideas are unfolded gradually by 
his intercourse with the external world the child learnt 
to distinguish forms and positions by a repeated and 
incessant use of his hands and eyes he learlis to walk 
to run to leap by slow and laborious degrees he dis 
tinguishes otie man from another and one animal from 
another only after repeated mistakes nor can we con 
ceive this to be otherwise how should the child know 
at once what muscles he is to exert in order to touch 
with iiis hand a certain visible object ttow should he 
know what muscles to exert that he may stand and not 
fall till he has tried often how should he learn 
direct his attention to the differences of different faces 
and persons till he is roused by some memory or hope 
which implies memory it seems to us as if the sensa 
tions could not without considerable practice be rightly 
referred to ideas of space force resemblance and the 
like 

yet that which thus appears impossible is in fclct 
done by animals the lamb almost immediately after its 
birth follows its mother accommodating the actions of its 
muscles to the form of the ground the chick just 
escaped from the shell picks up a minute insect directing 
its beak with the greatest accuracy even the huraari 
infant seeks the breast and exerts its muscles in sucking 
almost as soon as it is born hence then we see that 
instinct produces at once actions regulated by ideas or 
at least which take place as if they were regulated by 
ideas although the ideas cannot have been developed 
by exercise and only appear to exist so far as such 
actions are concerned 

 the term instinct may properly be opposed to 
sight the former implies an inward principle of action

implanted witbin a creature and practically impelling it 
but not capable of being developed into a subject of con

and knowing that the ideas by which he commonly di 
rects his actions space cause resemblance and the like 
have been developed to that degree of clearness in which 
he possesses them by the assiduous exercise of the senses 
and the mind from the earliest stage of infancy and that 
these ideas are capable of being still further unfolded 
into long trains of speculative truth he is unable to con 
ceive the manner in which animals possess such ideas as 
their instinctive actions disclose — ideas which neither 
require to be unfolded nor admit of unfolding which 
are aduate for practical purposes without any previous 
exercise and inadequate for speculative purposes with 
whatever labour cultivated 

i have ventured to make these few remarks on in 
stinct since it may perhaps justly be considered as the 
last province of biology where we reach the boundary 
line of psychology i have now before quitting this 
subject only one other principle to speak of

chapter vl 
of the idea of final causes 

 by an examination of those notions which enter 
into all our reasonings and judgments on living things it 
appeared that we conceive animal life as a vortex or cycle 
of moving matter in which the form of the vortex deter 
mines the motions and these motions again support the 
form of the vortex the stationary parts circulate the 
fluids and the fluids nourish the permanent parts each 
portion ministers to the others each depends upon the 
other the parts make up the whole but the existence 
of the whole is essential to the preservation of the parts 
but parts existing under such conditions are organs and 
the whole is organized this is the fundamental concep 
tion of organization organized beings says the physio 
logist are composed of a number of essential and 
mutually dependent parts an organized product of 
nature says the great metaphysician f is that in which 
all the parts are mutually ends and means 

 it will be observed that we do not content our 
selves with saying that in such a whole all the parts are 
muttiaut dependent this might be true even of a me 
chanical structure it would be easy to imagine a frame 
work in which each part should be necessary to the 
support of each of the others for example an arch of 
several stones but in such a structure the parts have 
no properties which they derive from the whole they 
are beams or stones when separate they are no more 
when joined but the same is not the case in an 
organized whole the limb of an animal separated from 

 mollbr elem p 
t kant utiheilikrqft p

 philosophy op biology 

the body loses the properties of a limb and soon ceases 
to retain even its fomi 

 nor do we content ourselves with saying that the 
parts are mutuaut eomes and effects this is the case 
in machinery in a clock the pendulum by means of 
the escapement causes the descent of the weight the 
weigjit by the same escapement keeps up the motion of 
the pendulum but things of this kind may happen by 
accident stones slide from a rock down the side of a 
hill and cause it to be smooth the smoothness of the 
slope causes stones still to slide yet no one would call 
such a slide n organized system the system is organ 
ized when the effects which take place among the parts 
are essential to our conception of ike whole when the 
whole would not be a whple nor the parts parts except 
these effects were produced when the effects not only 
hfippen in fact but are included in the idea of the object 
whep they are not only seen but foreseen not only ex 
pected but intended in short when instead of being 
causes and effects they are ends and meansy as they are 
termed in the above definition 

thus we necessarily include in our idea of organi 
zation the notion of an end a purpose a design or to 
use another phrase which has been peculiarly appro 
priated in this case a final cause this idea of a final 
cause is an essential condition in order to the pursuing 
our researches respecting organized bodies 

 this idea of final cause is not deduced from the 
phenomena by reasoning but is assumed as the only con 
dition under which we can reason on such subjects at all 
we do not deduce the idea of space or time or effi 
cient cause from the phenomena about us but necesfarily 
look at phenomena as subordinate to these ideas from 
the beginning of our reasoning it is true our ideas of 
relations of space ind time and force may become

idea of final causes 

ducb more clear by our familiarizing ourselves with par 
ticijlar pbepomeua but stil the fundamedtal deas are 
not generated but unfolded not extracted from the 
external world but evolved from the orld within jn 
like manner in the contelplation of organic structures 
we consider each part as subservient to some use and we 
cannot study the structure as organic without such a 
conception this notion of adaptation — this idea pf an 
end — ipay become much more clear and impressive by 
seeing it exemplified in particulai cases but still 
though suggested and evoked by specia cs it is not 
furnished by them jf it be not supplied by the min 
itself it can never be logically deduced from the pheno 
qiena it is not a portion of the facts which we study 
but it is a principle which connect includes and renders 
hem intelligible as our other fundamental idea do 
the classes of facts to which they respectively apply 

 this has already been confirmed by reference tp 
fact in the history of physiology i have shown that those 
who studied the structure of animals were irresistibly led 
to the conviction that the parts of this structure have 
each its end or purpose — that each member and organ 
not merely produces a certain effect or answers a certain 
use but is so framed as to impress us with the persuasioi 
that it was constructed yiw that use — that it was intended 
to produce the effect it was there seen that this per 
suasion was repeatedly expressed in the most emphatic 
manner by galen — that it directed the researches an 
led to the discoveries of harvey — that it has always 
been dwelt upon as a favourite contemplatiop and fol 
lowed as a certain guide by the best anatomists — and 
that it is inculcated by the physiologists of the profoundest 
views and naost extensive knowledge of our own time 
u these persons have deemed it a most certain and im 
portant principle of physiology that in every organized 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 phaosopht of biology 

structure plant or animal each intelligible part has its 
allotted office — each organ is designed for its appropriate 
function — that nature in these cases produces nothing 
in vain that in short each portion of the whole arrange 
ment has its final came an end to which it is adapted 
and in this end the reason that it is where and what 
it is 

 this notion of design in organized bodies must i 
say be supplied by the student of organization out of 
his own mind a truth which will become clearer if 
we attend to the most conspicuous and acknowledged 
instances of design the structure of the eye in which 
the parts are curiously adjusted so as to produce a distinct 
image on the retina as in an optical instrument — the 
trochlear muscle of the eye in which the tendon passes 
round a support and turns back like a rope round a 
pulley — the prospective contrivances for the preservation 
of animals provided long before they are wanted as the 
milk of the mother the teeth of the child the eyes and 
lungs of the foetus — these arrangements and innumer 
able others call up in us a persuasion that design has 
entered into the plan of animal form and progress and 
if we bring in our minds this conception of design nothing 
can more fully square with and fit it than such instances 
as these but if we did not already possess the idea of 
design — if we had not had our notion of mechanical 
contrivance awakened by inspection of optical instruments 
or pulleys or in some other way — if we had never been 
conscious ourselves of providing for the future — if this 
were the case we could not recognise contrivance and 
prospectiveness in such instances as we have referred to 
the facts are indeed admirably in accordance with these 
conceptions when the two are brought together but the 
facte and the conceptions come together from different 
quarters — from without and from within 



digitized by vjooq ic 



idea op final caue 

 we may farther illustrate this point by referring 
to the relations of travellers who tell us that when con 
summate examples of human mechanical contrivance 
have been set before savages they have appeared inca 
pable of apprehending them as proofs of design this 
shows that in such cases the idea of design had not 
been developed in the minds of the people who wer 
thus unintelligent but it no more proves that such an 
idea does not naturally and necessarily arise in the pro 
gress of mens minds than the confused manner in 
which the same savages apprehend the relations of space 
or number or cause proves that these ideas do not 
naturally belong to their intellects all men have these 
ideas and it is because they cannot help referring their 
sensations to such ideas that they apprehend the world 
as existing in time and space and as a series of causes 
and effects it would be very erroneous to say that the 
belief of such truths is obtained by logical reasoning 
from facts and in like manner we cannot logically 
deduce design from the contemplation of organic struc 
tures although it is impossible for us when the facts 
are clearly before us not to find a reference to design 
operating in our minds 

 again the evidence of the doctrine of final 
causes as a fundamental principle of biology may be 
obscured and weakened in some minds by the constant 
habit of viewing this doctrine with suspicion as unphi 
losophical and at variance with morphology by che 
rishing such views it is probable that many persons 
physiologists and others have gradually brought them 
selves to suppose that many or most of the anange 
ments which are familiarly adduced as instances of design 
may be accounted for or explained away — that there is 
a certain degree of prejudice and narrowness of compre 
hension in that lively admiration of the adaptation of

means to ends which common minds derive from the 
speetacle of organic arrangements and yet eren in 
persons accustomed to these views the strong and ttatu 
rai influence of the idea of a final cause the spon 
taneous recognition of the relation of means to an end 
as the assumption which makes organic arrangements 
intelligible breaks forth when we bring before them a 
new case with regard to which their genuine contictioni 
have not yet been modified by their intellectual habits 
i will offer as an example which may serve to illustrate 
this the discoveries recently made with regard to the 
process of suckling of the kangaroo in the case of this 
as of other pouched animals the young animal is re 
moved while very small and imperfectly formed from 
the womb to the pouch in which the teats are and is 
there placed with its lips against one of the nipples but 
the young animal taken altogether is not so large as 
the nipple and is therefore incapable of sucking after 
the manner of common mammala here is a difficulty 
how is it overcome — bj an appropriate contritxmee the 
nipple which in common mammals is not furnished with 
any muscle is in the kangaroo provided with a powerftil 
extrusory muscle by which the mother can inject the 
milk into the mouth of her offspring and again in 
order to give attachment to this muscle there is a bone 
which is not found in animals of other kinds but this 
mode of solving the problem of suckling so small a 
creature introduces another difficulty if the milk is 
injected into the mouth of the young one without any 
action of its own muscles what is to prevent the fluid 
entering the windpipe and producing suffocation how 
is this danger avoided nby another appitpriate ean 
frivanee there is a funnel in the back of the throat by 
which the air passage is completely separated from the 
passage for nutriment and the injected milk pastes in a

ditided stream on each side of the larynx to the oeso 
pha and as if to show that this apparatus is really 
formed with a yiew to the wants of the young one the 
structure alters in the course of the animals growth and 
the ainnel no longer needed is modified and disappears 
with regard to this and similar examples the remark 
which i would urge is thisthat no one however pre 
judiced or un philosophical he may in general deem the 
reference to final causes can at the first impression 
help regarding this curious system of arrangement as 
the means to an end so contemplated it becomes 
significant intelligible admirable without such a prin 
ciple it is an unmeaning complexity a collection of con 
tradictions producing an almost impossible result by a 
portentous conflict of chances the parts of this appara 
tus cannot have produced one another one part is in 
the mother another part in the young one without 
their harmony they could not be effective but nothing 
except design can operate to make them harmonious 
they are intended to work together and we cannot resist 
the conviction of this intention when the facts first come 
before us perhaps there may hereafter be physiolo 
gists who tracing the gradual development of the parts 
of which we have spoken and the analogies which con 
nect them with the structures of other animals may think 
that this development these analogies account for the 
conformation we have described and may hence think 
lightly of the explanation derived from the reference 
to final causesi yet surely it is clear on a calm con 
sideration of the subject that the latter explanation is 
not disturbed by the former and that the observers 
first impression that this is an irrefragable evidence 
of creative foresight f can never be obliterated how

ever miicli it may be obscured in the minds of those 
who confuse this view by mixing it with others which 
are utterly heterogeneous to it and therefore cannot be 
contradictory 

 i have elsewhere remarked how physiologists 
who thus look with suspicion and dislike upon the 
introduction of final causes into physiology have still 
been unable to exclude from their speculations causes 
of this kind thus cabanis saysf i regard with 
the great bacon the philosophy of final causes as 
sterile but i have elsewhere acknowledged that it was 
very difficult for the most cautious man never to have 
recourse to them in his explanations accordingly he 
says the partisans of final causes nowhere find argu 
ments so strong in favour of their way of looking at 
nature as in the laws which preside and the circumstances 
of all kinds which concur in the reproduction of living 
races in no case do the means employed appear so 
clearly relative to the end and it would be easy to find 
similar acknowledgments express or virtual in other wri 
ters of the same kind thus bichat after noting the dif 
ference between the organic sensibility by which the organs 
are made to perform their offices and the animal sensi 
bility of which the nervous centre is the seat says j no 
doubt it will be asked way — that is as we shall see for 
what end — the organs of internal life have received from 
nature an inferior degree of sensibility only and why 
they do not transmit to the brain the impressions which 
they receive while all the acts of the animal life imply 
this transmission the reason is simply this that all the 
phenomena which establish our connexions with surround 
ing objects ought to be and are in fact under the influence

of the will while all those which serve for the purpose 
of assimilation only escape and ought indeed to escape 
such influence the reason here assigned is the final 
cause which as bichat justly says we cannot help 
asking for 

 again i may quote from the writer last men 
tioned another remark which shows that in the organical 
sciences and in them alone the idea of forces as means 
acting to an end is inevitably assumed and acknowledged 
as of supreme authority in biology alone observes 
bichat have we to contemplate the state of disease 
 physiology is to the movements of living bodies what 
astronomy dynamics hydraulics c are to those of 
inert matter but these latter sciences have no branches 
which correspond to them as pathology corresponds to 
physiology for the same reason all notion of a medica 
ment is repugnant to the physical sciences a medica 
ment has for its object to bring the properties of the 
system back to their natural type but the physical pro 
perties never depart from this type and have no need to 
be brought back to it and thus there is nothing in the 
physical sciences which holds the place of therapeutick in 
physiology or as we might express it otherwise of inert 
forces we have no conception of what they ought to do 
except what they do the forces of gravity elasticity 
affinity never act in a diseased manner we never con 
ceive them as failing in their purpose for we do not 
conceive them as having any purpose which is answered by 
one mode of their action rather than another but with 
organical forces the case is different they are necessarily 
conceived as acting for the preservation and develop 
ment of the system in which they reside if they do not 
do this they fail they are deranged diseased they

certain type and if tliey cause or allow it to deviate from 
this type their action is distorted morbid contrary to the 
ends of nature and thus this conception of organized 
beings as susceptible of disease implies the recognition of 
a state of health and of the organs and the vital forces as 
means for preserving this normal condition the state of 
health and of perpetual development is necessarily con 
templated as the final cause of the processes and powers 
with which the different parts of plants and animals are 
endowed 

 this idea of a final cause is applicable as a fun 
damental and regulative idea to our speculations concern 
ing organised creatures only that there is a purpose in 
many other parts of the creation we find abundant reason 
to believe from the arrangements and laws which prevail 
around us but this persuasion is not to be allowed to 
regulate and direct our reasonings with regard to inor 
ganic matter of which conception the relation of means 
and end forms no essential part in mere physics final 
causes as bacon has observed are not to be admitted as 
a principle of reasoning but in the organical sciences 
the assumption of design and purpose in every part of 
every whole that is the pervading idea of final cause 
is the basis of sound reasoning and the source of true 
doctrine 

 the idea of final cause of end purpose design 
intention is altogether different from the idea of cause 
as efficient cause which we formerly had to consider and 
on this account the use of the word cause in this phrase 
has been objected to if the idea be clearly entertained 
and steadily applied the word is a question of subordinate 
importance the term final cause has been long fami 
liarly used and appears not likely to lead to confusion 

 the consideration of final causes both in phy 
siology and ip other subjects has at all times attracted

ii£a of final causes 

mucdi attention in conbequence of its bearing upon thq 
belief of aa intelligent author of the universe i do 
not intend in this plaoe to pursue the sulect far in this 
view but there is one antithesii of opinion already 
noticed in the history of physiology on which i will again 
make a few remarks 

it has appeared to some persons that the mere aspeot 
of order and symmetry in the works of nature — the 
oontemplation of comprehensive and consistent lawis 
sufficient to lead us to the conception of a design 
and intelligence producing the order and carrying into 
effeet the law without here attempting to decide 
whether this is true we may discern after what has 
been said that the conoeption of design arrived at in 
this manner is altogether difibrent from that idea of 
design which is suggested to us by organized bodies 
and which we describe as the doctrine of final causes 
the regular form of a crystal whatever beautiful sym 
metry it may exhibit whatever general laws it may 
exemplify does not prove design in the same manner in 
which design is proved by the provisions for the preser 
vation and growth of the seeds of plants and of the young 
of animals the law of universal gravitation however 
vnde and simple does not impress us with the belief of 
a purpose as does that propensity by which the two sexes 
of eaeh animal are brought together if it could be shown 
that the symmetrical structure of a flower results from 
laws of the same kind as those which determine the regu 
lar forms of crystals or the motions of the planet the 
discovery might be very striking and important but it 
would not at all come under our idea of final cause 

 accordingly there have been in modem times 
two different schools of physiologists the one proceeding 

 ffkt ind sol b zvii obap on the doctrine of final 
caoik in pkyvology

 philosophy of biology 

upon the idea of final causes the other school seeking 
in the realm of organized bodies wide laws and analogies 
from which that idea is excluded all the great biolo 
gists of preceding times and some of the greatest of 
modem times have belonged to the former school and 
especially cuvier who may be considered as the head of 
it it was solely by the assiduous application of this 
principle of final cause as he himself constantly declared 
that he was enabled to make the discoveries which have 
rendered his name so illustrious and which contain a £ar 
larger portion of important anatomical and biological 
truth than it ever before fell to the lot of one man to 
contribute to the science 

 the opinions which have been put in opposition 
to the principle of final causes have for the most part 
been stated vaguely and ambiguously among the most 
definite of such principles is that which in the history 
of the subject i have termed the principle of metamor 
phosed and developed symmetry upon which has been 
founded the science of morphology 

the reality and importance of this principle are not 
to be denied by us we have shown how they are proved 
by its application in various sciences and especially in 
botany but those advocates of this principle who have 
placed it in antithesis to the doctrine of final causes 
have by this means done fietr more injustice to their own 
favourite doctrine than damage to the one which they 
opposed the adaptation of the bones of the skeleton to 
the muscles the provision of fulcrums projecting pro 
cesses channels so that the motions and forces shall 
be such as the needs of life require cannot possibly 
become less striking and convincing from any discovery 
of general analogies of one animal frame with another 
or of laws connecting the development of different parts 
whenever such laws are discovered we can only consider

them as the means of producing that adaptation which 
we so much admire our conviction that the artist

 the irresistible and constant iprehension of a 
purpose in the forms and functions of animals has intro 
duced into the writings of speculators on these subjects 
various forms of expression more or less precise more or 
less figurative as that animals are framed with a view 
to the part which they have to play — that nature does 
nothing in vain that she employs the best means for her 
ends and the like however metaphorical or inexact any 
of these phrases may be in particular yet taken altogether 
they convey clearly and definitely enough to preclude any 
serious error a principle of the most profound reality and 
of the highest importance in the organical sciences but 
some adherents of the morphological school of which i 
have spoken reject and even ridicule all such modes of 
expression i know nothing says m geoffrey saint 
hilaire of animals which have to play a part in nature 
i cannot make of nature an intelligent being who does 
nothing in vain who acts by the shortest mode who 
does all for the best the philosophers of this school 
therefore do not it would seem feel any of the admira

have been curried yet the dear and deepeated con 
viction of the reality of theae proyisions whidi the study 
of anatomy produces in its most profound and accurate 
eultiyatorsy cannot be shaken by any objections to the 
metaphors or terms in which this conviction is clothed 
in regard to the idea of a purpose in organization as in 
regard to any other idea we cannot fully express our 
meaning by phrases borrowed from any extraneous source 
but that impossibility arises precisely from the circum 
stance of its being a fundamental idea which is inevit 
ably assumed in our representation of each special fetet 
the same objection has been made to the idea of mecha 
nical forcey on accoimt of its being often expressed in 
metaphorical language for writers have spoken of an 
wergy effbru or sohcitahan to motion and bodies have 
been said to be animated by a force such language it 
has been urged implies volition and the act of animated 
beings but the idea of force as distinct from mere 
motion— ras the cause of motion or of tendency to 
motionis not on that account less real we endeavour 
in vain to conduct our mechaniwl reasonings without the 
aid of this idea and must express it as we can just as 
little can we reason concerning organized beings without 
assuming that each part has its function each function 
its purpose and so for as our phrases imply this they 
will not mislead us however inexact or however iigu 
rative they be 

 the doctrine of a purpose in organization has 
been sometimes called the doctrine of the candiiioms 
eavdmee and has been stated as teadiing that each 
animal must be so framed as to contain in its structure 
the conditions which its existence requires when ex

of his existence when indeed the general scheme 
and mode of being of an animal are known the expert 
and profound anatomist can reason concerning the pro 
portions and form of its various parts and organs and 
prove in some measure what their relations must be 
we can assert with cuvier that certain forms of the 
viscera require certain forms of the teeth certain forms 
of the limbs certain powers of the senses but in all 
this the functions of selfnutrition and digestion are sup 
posed already existing as ends and it being taken for 
granted as the only conceivable basis of reasoning that 
the organs are means to these ends we may discover 
what modifications of these organs are necessarily related 
to and connected with each other instead of terming 
this rule of speculation merely the principle of the couf

the conditions of organs as meam adapted to animal

cuviers great work the ossemens fossiles cannot be the 
consequence of a mere identical proposition 

 it has been objected also that the doctrine of 
final causes supposes us to be acquainted with the inten 
tions of the creator which it is insinuated is a most 
presumptuous and irrational basis for our reasonings 
but there can be nothing presumptuous or irrational in 
reasoning on that basis which if we reject we cannot 
reason at all if men really can discern and cannot 
help discerning a design in certain portions of the works 
of creation this perception is the soundest and most 
satisfectory ground for the convictions to which it 
leads the ideas which we necessarily employ in the 
contemplation of the world around us afford us the 
only natural means of forming any conception of the 
creator and governor of the universe and if we are by 
such means enabled to elevate our thoughts however 
inadequately towards him where is the presumption of 
doing so or rather where is the wisdom of refusing to 
open our minds to contemplations so animating and ele 
vating and yet so entirely convincing we possess the 
ideas of time and space under which all the objects of 
the universe present themselves to us and in virtue of 
these ideas thus possessed we believe the creator to be 
eternal and omnipotent when we find that we in like 
manner possess the idea of a design in creation and 
that with regard to ourselves and creatures more or less 
resembling ourselves we cannot but contemplate their 
constitution under this idea we cannot abstain from 
ascribing to the creator the infinite profundity and 
extent of design to which all these special instances 
belong as parts of a whole 

 i have here considered design as manifest in 
organization only for in that field of speculation it is 
forced upon us as contained in all the phenomena and

idea of final causes 

as the only mode of our understanding them the 
existence of final causes has often been pointed out 
in other portions of the creation — in the apparent 
adaptations of the various parts of the earth and of the 
solar system to each other and to organized beings in 
these provinces of speculation however the principle of 
final causes is no longer the basis and guide but the 
sequel and result of our physical reasonings if in look 
ing at the universe we follow the widest analogies of 
which we obtain a view we see however dimly reason 
to believe that all its laws are adapted to each other and 
intended to work together for the benefit of its organic 
population and for the general welfare of its rational 
tenants on this subject however not immediately 
included in the principle of final causes as here stated 
i shall not dwell i will only make this remark that 
the assertion appears to be quite unfounded that as 
science advances from point to point final causes recede 
before it and disappear one after the other the prin 
ciple of design changes its mode of application indeed 
but it loses none of its force we no longer consider 
particular facts as produced by special interpositions but 
we consider design as exhibited in the establishment and 
adjustment of the laws by which particular fiicts are pro 
duced we do not look upon each particular cloud as 
brought near us that it may drop fatness on our fields 
but the general adaptation of the laws of heat and air 
and moisture to the promotion of vegetation does not 
become doubtful we do not consider the sun as less 
intended to warm and vivify the tribes of plants and 
animals because we find that instead of revolving round 
the earth as an attendant the earth along with other 
planets revolves round him we are rather by the dis 
covery of the general laws of nature led into a scene of 
wider design of deeper contrivance of more comprehen

sive adjustments final causes if they appear driven 
further from us by such an extension of our views 
embrace us only with a vaster and more majestic circuit 
instead of a few threads connecting some detached objects 
they become a stupendous network which is wound 
round and round the universal frame of things 

i now quit the subject of biology and vnth it the circle 
of sciences depending upon separate original ideas and 
permanent relations tf from the general relations which 
permanentlyprevail and constantly recur among the objects 
around us we turn to the inquiry of what has actually 
happened— if from science we turn to history— we find 
ourselves in a new field in this region of speculation 
we can rarely obtain a complete and scientific view of 
the connexion between objects and events the past 
history of man of the arts of languages of the earth 
of the solar system offers a vast series of problems of 
which perhaps not one has been rigorously solved still 
man as his speculative powers unfold themselves cannot 
but feel prompted and invited to employ his thoughts 
even on these problems he cannot but wish and endea 
vour to understand the connexion between the successive 
links of such chains of events he attempts to form a 
science which shall be applicable to each of these 
histories and thus he begins to construct the class of

chapter i 
of palietiological sciences in general 

 i have already stated in the hiitorjf the sci 
ences that the class of sciences which i designate as 
pdcbticiogical are those in which the object is to ascend 
from the present state of things to a more ancient con 
dition from which the present is derived by intelligible 
canses as conspicuous examples of this class we may 
take geology glossology or comparative philology and 
comparative archaeology these provinces of knowledge 
might perhaps be intelligibly described as histories the 
history of the earth — the history of languages — the 
history of arts but these phrases would not fully 
describe the sciences we have in view for the object 
to which we now suppose their investigations to be 
directed is not merely to ascertain what the series of 
events has been as in the common forms of history 
but also how it has been brought about these sciences 
are to treat of causes as well as of effects such re 
searches might be termed philosophical history or in 
order to mark more distinctly that the causes of events 
are the leading object of attention etiological history 
but since it will be more convenient to describe this 
class of sciences by a single appellation have taken the

liberty of proposing to call them the pdattiohgical 
sciences 

while palcbontology describes the beings which have 
lived in former ages without investigating their causes 
and jetiology treats of causes without distinguishing his 
torical from mechanical causation pdbtiology is a com 
bination of the two sciences exploring by means of the 
second the phenomena presented by the first the 
portions of knowledge which i include in this tenn are 
palaeontological setiological sciences 

 all these sciences are connected by this bond — 
that they all endeavour to ascend to a past state by 
considering what is the present state of things and what 
are the causes of change geology examines the exist 
ing appearances of the materials which form the earth 
infers from them previous conditions and speculates con 
cerning the forces by which one condition has been made 
to succeed another another science cultivated with 
great zeal and success in modern times compares the 
languages of different countries and nations and by an 
examination of their materials and structure endeavours 
to determine their descent from one another this science 
has been termed comparative philology or ethnography 
and by the french linguistique a word which we might 
imitate in order to have a single name for the science 
but the greek derivative glossology appears to be more 
convenient in its form the progress of the arts archi

tarest and most complete condition to their earliest fonn 
in various nations — are problems of great interest 
belonging to another subject which we may for the 
present term comparative archaeology i have already 
noticed in the history f how the researches into the 
origin of natural objects and those relating to works of 
art pass by slight gradations into each other how the 
examination of the changes which have affected an ancient 
temple or fortress harbour or river may concern alike 
the geologist and the antiquary cuviers assertion that 
the geologist is an antiquary of a new order is perfectly 
correct for both are palsetiologists 

 we are very far from having exhausted by this 
enumeration the class of sciences which are thus con 
nected we may easily point out many other subjects 
of speculation of the same kind as we may look back 
towards the first condition of our planet we may in like 
manner turn our thoughts towards the first condition of 
the solar system and try whether we can discern any 
traces of an order of things antecedent to that which is 
now established and if we find as some great mathe 
maticians have conceived indications of an earlier state 
in which the planets were not yet gathered into their 
present forms we have in the pursuit of this train of 
research a paltiological portion of astronomy again 
as we may inquire how languages and how man have 
been diffused over the earths surfiace from place to 
place we may make the like inquiry with regard to the 
races of plants and animals founding our inferences upon 
the existing geographical distribution of the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms and thus the geography of plants 
and of animals also becomes a portion of palsbtiology 
again as we can in some measure trace the progress of 
arts from nation to nation and from age to age we can

also pursue a bimilar investigation with respect to the 
progress of mythology of poetry of government of 
law thus the philosophical history of the human race 
viewed with reference to these subjects if it can give rise 
to knowledge so exact as to be properly called science 
tvill supply sciences belonging to the class i am now to 
consider 

 it is not an arbitrary and useless proceeding to 
construct such a class of sciences for wide and various 
as their subjects are it will be found that they have all 
certain principles maxims and rules of procedure in 
common and thus may ieflect light upon each other 
by being treated of together indeed it will i trust 
appear that we may by such a juxtaposition of difierent 
speculations obtain most salutary lessons and ques 
tions which when viewed as they first present themselves 
under the aspect of a special science disturb and alarm 
mens minds may perhaps be contemplated more calmly 
as well as more clearly when they are considered as 
general problems of palietiology 

 it will at once occur to the reader that if we 
include in the circuit of our classification such subjects as 
have been mentioned — politics and law mythology and 
poetry— we are travelling very far beyond the material 
sciences within whose limits we at the outset proposed 
to confine our discussion of principles but we shall 
remain faithful to our original plan and for that purpose 
shall confine ourselves in this work to those palatiological 
sciences which deal with material things it is true that 
the general principles and maxims which regulate these 
sciences apply also to investigations of a parallel kind 
respecting the products which result from mans imagi 
native and social endowments but although there may 
be a similarity in the general form of such portions of 
knowledge their materials are so different from those

with which we have been hitherto dealing that we cannot 
hope to take them into our present account with any 
profit language government law poetry art em 
brace a number of peculiar fundamental ideas hitherto 
not touched upon in the disquisitions in which we have 
been engaged and most of them involved in far greater 
perplexity and ambiguity the subject of controversies 
far more vehement than the ideas we have hitherto 
been examining we must therefore avoid resting 
any part of our philosophy upon sciences or supposed 
sciences which treat of such subjects to attend to 
this caution is the only way in which we can secure 
the advantage we proposed to ourselves at the outset 
of taking as the basis of our speculations none but 
systems of undisputed truths clearly understood and 
expressed we have already said that we must know 
ingly and voluntarily resign that livelier and warmer 
interest which doctrines on subjects of polity or art pos 
sess and content ourselves with the cold truths of the 
material sciences in order that we may avoid having 
the very foundations of our philosophy involved in con 
troversy doubt and obscurity 

 we may remark however that the necessity of 
rejecting from our survey a large portion of the researches 
which the general notion of palsetiology includes sug 
gests one consideration which adds to the interest of 
our task we bgan our inquiry with the trust that 
any sound views which we should be able to obtain 
respecting the nature of truth in the physical sciences 
and the mode of discovering it must also tend to throw 
light upon the nature and prospects of knowledge of 
all other kinds — must be useful to us in moral poli 
tical and philological researches we stated this as a

confident anticipation and the evidence of the justice 
of our belief already begins to appear we have seen 
in the last book that biology leads us to psychology 
if we choose to follow the path and thus the passage 
irom the material to the immaterial has already un 
folded itself at one point and we now perceive that 
there are several large provinces of speculation which 
concern subjects belonging to mans immaterial nature 
and which are governed by the same laws as sciences 
altogether physical it is not our business here to dwell 
on the prospects which our philosophy thus opens to our 
contemplation but we may allow ourselves in this last 
stage of our pilgrimage among the foundations of the 
physical sciences to be cheered and animated by the ray 
that thus beams upon us however dimly from a higher 
and brighter region 

but in our reasonings and examples we shall mainly 
confine ourselves to the physical sciences and for the 
most part to geology which in the history i have put 
forwards as the best representative of the palaetiological 
sciences

logical science 

 divisions of such sciences — in each of the sciences 
of this class we consider some particular order of pheno 
mena now existing from our knowledge of the causes 
of change among such phenomena we endeavour to infer 
the causes which have made this order of things what it 
is we ascend in this manner to some previous stage of 
such phenomena and from that by a similar course of 
inference to a still earlier stage and to its causes 



digitized by vjooq ic 



f£mb£rs of a palibtiological science 

hence it will be seen that each such science will consist 
of two parts — the knowledge of the phenomena and the 
knowledge of their causes and such a division is in 
fact generally recognised in such sciences thus we have 
history and the philosophy of history we have comr 
parison of languages and the theories of the origin and 
progress of language we have descriptive geology 
and theoretical or physical geology in all these cases 
the relation between the two parts in these several 
provinces of knowledge is nearly the same and it may 
on some occasions at least be useful to express the dis 
tinction in a uniform or general manner the investiga 
tion of causes has been termed jeticlogy by philosophical 
writers and this term we may use in contradistinction 
to the mere phenomenology of each such department of 
knowledge and thus we should have phenomenal geo 
logy and etiological geology for the two divisions of 
the science which we have above termed descriptive and 
theoretical geology 

 study of games — but our knowledge respecting 
the causes which actually hate produced any order of 
phenomena must be arrived at by ascertaining what the 
causes of change in such matters can do in order to 
learn for example what share earthquakes and volcanoes 
and the beating of the ocean against its shores ought to 
have in our theory of geology we must make out what 
effects these agents of change are able to produce and 
this must be done not hastily or unsystematically but 
in a careful and connected manner in short this study of 
the causes of change in each order of phenomena must 
become a distinct body of science which must include a 
large amount of knowledge both comprehensive and 
precise before it can be applied to the construction of a 
theory we must have an ietiology corresponding to 
each order of phenomena 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 philosophy of paletilgy 

 jetiology — in the history of geology i have 
spoken of the necessity for such an ietiology with regard 
to geological phenomena this necessity i have compared 
with that which at the time of kepler required the 
formation of a separate science of dynamics the doctrine 
of the causes of motion before physical astronomy 
could grow out of phenomenal astronomy in pursuance 
of this analogy i have there given the name of geological 
dtfnamics to the science which treats of the causes of 
geological change in general but as i have there inti 
mated in a large portion of the subject the changes are 
so utterly different in their nature from any modification 
of motion that the term dynamics so applied sounds 
harsh and strange for in this science we have to treat 
not only of the subterraneous forces by which parts of the 
earths crust are shaken elevated or ruptured but also 
of the causes which may change the climate of a portion 
of the earths surface making a country hotter or colder 
than in former ages again we have to treat of the 
causes which modify the forms and habits of animals 
and vegetables and of the extent to which the effects of 
such causes can proceed whether for instance they can 
extinguish old species and produce new these and other 
similar investigations would not be naturally included in 
the notion of dynamics and therefore it will be better 
to use the term jetiohgy when we wish to group together 
all those researches which have it for their object to de 
termine the laws of such changes in the same manner 
the comparison and history of languages if it is to lead 
to any stable and exact knowledge must have appended 
to it an ietiology which aims at determining the nature 
and the amount of the causes which really do produce 
changes in language as colonization conquest the mix 
ture of races civilization literature and the like and 
the same rule applies to all sciences of this class we

members of a paubtiological science 

shall now make a few remarks on the characteristics of 
such branches of science as those to which we are led by 
the above considerations 

 phenomenologj requires classification phenome 
tud geology — the phenomenal portions of each science 
imply classification for no description of a large and 
varied mass of phenomena can be useful or intelligible 
without classification a representation of phenomena 
in order to answer the purposes of science must be sys 
tematic accordingly in giving the history of descrip 
tive or phenomenal geology i have called it systematic 
geology just as classificatory botany is termed systematic 
botany moreover as we have already seen classifica 
tion can never be an arbitrary process but always implies 
some natural connexion among the objects of the same 
class for if this did not exist the classes could not be 
made the subjects of any true assertion yet though 
the classes of phenomena which our system acknowledges 
must be such as already exist in nature the discovery of 
these is for the most part very far from obvious or easy 
to detect the true principles of natural classes and to 
select marks by which these may be recognised are steps 
which require genius and good fortune and which to 
the lot only of the most eminent persons in each science 
in the history i have pointed out werner william 
smith and cuvier as the three great authors of sys 
tematic geology of europe the mode of classifying the 
materials of the earths surface which was found by these 
philosophers fitted to enunciate such general fkcts as 
came under their notice was to consider the rocks and 
other materials as divided into successive layers or strata 
superimposed one on another and variously inclined and 
broken the german geologist distinguished his strata 
for the most part by their mineralogical character the

 philosophy of palietiology 

other two by the remains of animals and plants which the 
rocks contained after a beginning had thus been made 
in giving a genuine scientific form to phenomenal geology 
other steps followed in rapid succession as has already 
been related in the history the classification of the 
strata was fixed by a suitable nomenclature attempts 
were made to apply to other countries the order of strata 
which had been found to prevail in that first studied 
and in this manner it was ascertained what rocks in 
distant regions are the synonyms or equivalentsfy of each 
other the knowledge thus collected and systematized 
was exhibited in the form of geological maps 

moreover among the phenomena of geology we have 
laws of nature as well as classes the general form of 
mountain chains the relations of the direction and incli 
nation of different chains to each other the general 
features of mineral veins faults and fissures the preva 
lent characters of slaty cleavage — weie the subjects of 
laws established or supposed to be established by exten 
sive observation of facts in like manner the organic 
fossils discovered in the strata were found to follow 
certain laws with reference to the climate which they 
appeared to have lived in and the evidence which uiey 
gave of a regular zoological development and thus by 
the assiduous labours of many accomplished and active 
philosophers descriptive or phenomenal geology was 
carried towards a state of completeness 

 phenomenal uranographt — in like manner in 
other palsetiological researches as soon as they approach 
to an exact and scientific form we find the necessity of 
constructing in the first place a science of classification 
and exact description by means of which the phao 
mena may be correctly represented and compared and of

obtaining by this step a solid basis for an inquiry into the 
causes which have produced them thus the palaetiology 
of the solar system has in recent times drawn the atten 
tion of speculators and a hypothesis has been started 
that our sun and his attendant planets have been produced 
by the condensation of a mass of diffused matter such as 
that which constitutes the nebulous patches which we 
observe in the starry heavens but the sagest and most 
enlightened astronomers have not failed to acknowledge 
that to verify or to disprove this conjecture must be the 
work of many ages of observation and thought they 
have perceived also that the first step of the labour re 
quisite for the advancement of this portion of science must 
be to obtain and to record the most exact knowledge at 
present within our reach respecting the phenomena of 
these nebulae with which we thus compare our own system 
and as a necessary element of such knowledge they have 
seen the importance of a classification of these objects 
and of others such as double stars of the same kind 
sir william herschel who first perceived the bearing of 
the phenomena of nebulae upon the history of the solar 
system made the observation of such objects his business 
vnth truly admirable zeal and skill and in the account 
of the results of his labours gave a classification of ne 
bulae separating them into first clusters of stars second 
resolvable nebuue third proper nebula fourth pla 
netartf nebulte fifth steuar ndndm sixth nebulous 
stars and since in order to obtain from these remote 
appearances any probable knowledge respecting our own 
system we must discover whether they undergo any 
changes in the course of ages he devoted himself to the 
task of forming a record of their number and appearance 
in his own time that thus the astronomers of succeeding

generations might have a definite and exact standard 
with which to compare their observations still this 
task would have been executed only for that part of the 
heavens which is visible in this country if this hippar 
chus of the nebulee and double stars had not left behind 
him a son who inherited all his fathers zeal and more 
than his fathers knowledge sir john herschel in 
 went to the cape of good hope to complete what 
sir william herschel left wanting and in the course of 
five years observed with care all the nebulae and double 
stars of the southern hemisphere this great herschdian 
stney of the heavens the completion of which is the 
noblest monument ever erected by a son to a father must 
necessarily be to all ages the basis of all speculations 
concerning the history and origin of the solar system 
and has completed so for as at present it can be com 
pleted the phenomenal portion of astronomical palae 
tiology 

 phenomenal geography of plants and animals — 
again there is another palsatiological science closely 
connected with the speculations forced upon the geolo 
gist by the organic fossils which he discovers imbedded 
in the strata of the earth — namely the science which 
has for its object the causes of the difiusion and distri 
bution of the various kinds of plants and animals and 
this science also has for its first portion and indispensable 
foundation a description and classification of the existing 
phenomena such portions of science have recently been 
cultivated with great zeal and success under the titles of 
the geography of plants and the geography of animals 
and the results of the inquiries thus undertaken have 
assumed a definite and scientific form by leading to a 
division of the earths surface into a certain number of 
botanical and zoological provinces each province occupied 
by its own peculiar vegetable and animal population 



digitized by vjooq ic 



membbrs of a palitiological science 

we find too in the course of these investigations various 
general laws of the phenomena offered to our notice 
such for instance as this — that the difference of the 
animals originally occuppng each province which is clear 
and entire for the higher orders of animals and plants 
becomes more doubtful and indistinct when we descend 
to the lower kinds of organisations as infusoria and 
zoophytes in the animal kingdom grasses and mosses 
among vegetables again other laws discovered by 
those who have studied the geography of plants are 
these — that countries separated from each other by wide 
tracts of sea as the opposite shores of the mediterranean 
the islands of the indian and pacific oceans have usually 
much that is common in their vegetation — and again 
that in parallel climates analogous tribes replace each 
other it would be easy to adduce other laws but those 
already stated may serve to show the great extent of the 
portions of knowledge which have just been mentioned 
even considered as merely sciences of phenomena 

 phenomenal glossology — it is not my purpose in 
the present work to borrow my leading illustrations from 
any portions of knowledge but those which are concerned 
with the study of material nature and i shall therefore 
not dwell upon a branch of research singularly interest 
ing and closely connected with the one just mentioned 
but dealing with relations of thought rather than of 
things — i mean the paleetiology of language — the 
theory so fer as the facts enable us to form a theory of 
the causes which have led to the resemblances and differ 
ences of human speech in various regions and various 
ages this indeed would be only a portion of the study 
of the history and origin of the difision of animals if we 
were to include ntan among the animals whose dispersion

we thus investigate for language is one of the most 
clear and imperishable records of the early events in the 
career of the human race but the peculiar nature of 
the faculty of speech and the ideas which the use of it 
involves make it proper to treat glossology as a distinct 
science and of this science the first part must neces 
sarily be as in the other sciences of this order a classifi 
cation and comparison of languages governed in many 
respects by the same rules and presenting the same diffi 
culties as other sciences of classification such accord 
ingly has been the procedure of the most philosophical 
glossologists they have been led to throw the languages 
of the earth into certain large classes or families accord 
ing to various kinds of resemblance as the semitic 
iamily to which belong hebrew arabic chaldean 
syrian phoenician ethiopian and the like the indo 
ewropean which includes sanskrit persian greek latin 
and german the monosyllabic languages chinese tibe 
tan birman siamese the polysynthetic languages a 
class including most of the northamerican indian 
dialects and others and this work of classification 
has been the result of the labour and study of many very 
profound linguists and has advanced gradually from step 
to step thus the indoeuropean family was first formed 
on an observation of the coincidences between sanskrit 
greek and latin but it was soon found to include the 
teutonic languages and more recently dr prichard 
has shown beyond doubt that the celtic must be included 
in the same femily other general resemblances and 
differences of languages have been marked by appropriate 
terms thus august von schlegel has denominated 
them synthetical and analytical according as they foitn 
their conjugations and declensions by auxiliary verbs and

prepositions or by changes in the word itself and the 
pdysynthetic languages are so named by mduponcean 
in consequence of their still more complex mode of 
inflexion nor are there wanting in this science also 
general laws of phenomena such for instance is the 
curious rule of the interchange of consonants in the 
cognate words of greek xothic and german which has 
been discovered by james grimm all these remark 
able portions of knowledge and the great works which 
have appeared on glossology such for example as the 
mithridates of adelung and vater contain for their 
laigest and hitherto probably their most valuable part 
the phenomenal portion of the science the comparison of 
languages as they now are and beyond all doubt 
until we have brought this comparative philology to a 
considerable degree of completeness all our speculations 
respecting the causes which have operated to produce 
the languages of the earth must be idle and unsubstantial 
dreams 

thus in all palaetiological sciences in all attempts to 
trace back the history and discover the origin of the pre 
sent state of things the portion of the science which 
must first be formed is that which classifies the pheno 
mena and discovers general laws prevailing among them 
when this work is performed and not till then we may 
begin to speculate successfully concerning causes and to 
make some progress in our attempts to go back to an 
origin we must have a phenomenal science preparatory 
to each jstiohgical one 

 the study of phenomena leads to theory — as we 
have just said we cannot in any subject speculate suc 
cessfully concerning the causes of the present state of 
things till we have obtained a tolerably complete and 
systematic view of the phenomena yet in reality men 
have not in any instance waited for this completeness

and sybtem in their knowledge of fkcts before they have 
begun to foiga theories nor was it natural considering 
the speculative propensities of the human mind and how 
incessantly it is endeavouring to apply the idea of gause 
that it should thus restrain itself i have already noticed 
this in the history of geology while we have been 
giving an account it is there said of the objects with 
which descriptive geology is occupied it must have been 
mt how diibcult it is in contemplating such fistcts to 
confine ourselves to description and classification con 
jectures and reasonings respecting the causes of the phe 
nomena force themselves upon us at every step and 
even influence our classification and nomenclature our 
descriptive gteology impels us to construct a physical 
geology and the same is the case with regard to the 
other subjects which i have mentioned the mere con 
sideration of the different degrees of condensation of dif 
irent nebulae led herschel and laplace to the hypothesis 
that our solar system is a condensed nebula immediately 
upoh the division of the earths surface into botanical and 
leoological provinces and even at an earlier period the 
opposite hypotheses of the origin of all the animals of 
each kind from a single pair and of their original diffiisioii 
all over the earth were under discussion and the con 
sideration of the fttmilies of languages irresistibly led to 
speculations concerning the families of the earliest human 
inhabitants of the earth in all cases the contemplation 
of a very few phenomena the discovery of a very few 
steps in the history made men wish for and attempt 
to form a theory of the history from the very beginning 
of things 

 no sound theory without etiology — but though 
man is thus impelled by the natural propensities of his 
intellect to trace each order of things to its causes 
he does not at first discern the only sure way of

obtaining such knowledge he does not suspect how 
much labour and how much method are requisite for sue 
cess in this undertaking he is not aware that for each 
order of phenomena he must construct by the accumu 
lated results of multiplied observation and distinct 
thought a separate etiology thus as i have elsewhere 
remarked when men had for the first time become ac 
quainted with some of the leading phenomena of qeology 
and had proceeded to speculate concerning the past 
changes and revolutions by which such results had been 
produced they forthwith supposed themselves able to 
judge what would be the effects of any of the obvious 
agents of change as water or volcanic fire it did not 
at first occur to them to suspect that their common and 
extemporaneous judgment on such points was by no 
means suflscient for sound knowledge they did not 
foresee that before they could determine what share these 
or any other causes had had in producing the present cou 
dition of the earth they must create a special science 
whoise object should be to estimate the general laws and 
effects of such assumed causes — that before they could 
obtain any sound geological theory they must carefully 
cultivate geological sltiology 

the same disposition to proceed immediately from 
the facts to the theory without constructing as an inter 
mediate step a science of causes might be pointed out 
in the other sciences of this order but in all of them 
this error has been corrected by the failures to which it 
led it soon appeared for instance that a more careful 
inquiry into the effects which climate food habit and 
circumstances can produce in animals was requisite in 
order to determine how the diversities of animals in 
difierent countries have originated the etiology of 
animal life if we may be allowed to give this name to

that study of such causes of change which is at present 
bo zealously cultivated and which yet has no distinctive 
designation is now perceived to be a necessary portion of 
all attempts to construct a history of the earth and its 
inhabitants 

 catise in palcdtiohgy — we are thus led to con 
template a class of sciences which are commenced with 
the study of causes we have already considered sci 
ences which depended mainly upon the idea of cause 
namely the mechanical sciences but it is obvious that 
the idea of cause in the researches now under our con 
sideration must be employed in a very different way from 
that in which we applied it formerly force is the cause 
of motion because force at all times and under all cir 
cumstances if not counteracted produces motion but 
the cause of the present condition and elevation of the 
alps whatever it was was manifested in a series of 
events of which each happened but once and occupied 
its proper place in the series of time the former is 
mechanical the latter historical came in our present 
investigations we consider the events which we contem 
plate of whatever order they be as forming a chain which 
is extended from the beginning of things down to the 
present time and the causes of which we now speak are 
those which connect the successive links of this chain 
every occurrence which has taken place in the history of 
the solar system or the earth or its vegetable and animal 
creation or man has been at the same time effect and 
cause — the effect of what preceded the cause of what 
succeeded by being effect and cause it has occupied 
some certain portion of time and the times which have 
thus been occupied by effects and causes summed up 
and taken all together make up the total of past time 
the past has been a series of events connected by this 
historical causation and the present is the last term of

with which we are here concerned is to determine the 
manner in which each tenn is derived from the pre 
ceding and thus if possible to calculate backwards to 
the origin of the series 

 vaniotis kinds of cause — those modes by which 
one term in the natural series of events is derived from 
another the forms of historical causation the kinds of 
connexion between the links of the infinite chain of time 
are very various nor need we attempt to enumerate them 
but these kinds of causation being distinguished from 
each other and separately studied each becomes the 
subject of a separate etiology thus the causes of 
change in the earths surface residing in the elements 
fire and water form the main subject of geological sltio 
logy the etiology of the vegetable and animal king 
doms investigates the causes by which the forms and dis 
tribution of species of plants and animals are affected 
the study of causes in glossology leads to an etiology 
of language which shall distinguish analyse and estimate 
the causes by which certain changes are produced in the 
languages of nations in like manner we may expect to 
have an etiology of ait which shall scrutinize the influ

birth to its successor by which for example there have 
been brctught into being those various forms of architec 
ture which we term egyptian doric ionic roman 
byzantine romanesque gothic italian elizabethan it 
is easily seen by this slight survey how manifold and 
diverse are the kinds of cause which the paleetiological 
sciences bring under our consideration but in each of 
those sciences we shall obtain solid and complete systems 
of knowledge only so far as we study with steady thought 
and careful observation that peculiar kind of cause which 
is appropriate to the phenomena under our consideration

 hypothetical order of pakstiological causes 
the various kinds of bistorical cause are not only con 
nected avith each other by their common bearing upon 
the historical sciences but they form a kind of progression 
which we may represent to ourselves as having acted in 
succession in the hypothetical history f the earth and its 
inhabitants thus assuming merely as a momentary 
hypothesis the origin of the solar system by the conden 
sation of a nebula we have to contemplate first the 
causes by which the luminous incandescent diffiised mass 
of which a nebula is supposed to be constituted is grar 
dually condensed cooled collected into definite masses 
solidified and each portion made to revolve about its 
axis and the whole to travel about another body we 
have no difficulty in ascribing the globular form of each 
mass to the mutual attraction of its particles but 
when this form was once assumed and covered with a 
solid crust are there we may ask in the constitution of 
such a body any causes at work by which the crust 
might be again broken up and portions of it displaced 
and covered with other matter again if we can thug 
explain the origin of the earth can we with like success 
account for the presence of the atmosphere and the 
waters of earth and ocean supposing this done we 
have then to consider by what causes such a body could 
become stocked with vegetable and animal life for 
there have not been wanting persons extravagant spe 
culators no doubt who have conceived that eveji this 
event in the history of the world might be the work 
of natural causes supposing an origin given to life 
upon our earth we have then brought before us by 
geological observations a series of different forms of 
vegetable and animal existence occurring in different 
strata and as the phenomena appear irresistibly to 
prove existing at successive periods and we are com

pelled to inquire what can have been the causes by 
which the forms of each period have passed into those of 
the next we find too that strata which must have 
been at first horizontal and continuous have undergone 
enormous dislocations and ruptures and we have to con 
sider the possible effect of aqueous and volcanic causes 
to produce such changes in the earths crust we are 
thus led to the causes which have produced the present 
state of things on the earth and these are causes to 
which we may hypothetically ascribe not only the form 
and position of the inert materials of the earth but also 
the nature and distribution of its animal and vegetable 
population man too no less than other animals is 
affected by the operation of such causes as we have re 
ferred to and must therefore be included in such specu 
lations but mans history only begins where that of 
other animals ends with his mere existence they are 
stationary he is progressive other species of animals 
once brought into being continue the same through all 
ages man is changing from age to age his language his 
thoughts his works yet even these changes are boutid 
together by laws of causation and these causes too may 
become objects of scientific study and such causes 
though not to be dwelt upon now since we permit our 
selves to found our philosophy upon the material sciences 
only must still when treated scientifically fall within 
the principles of our philosophy and must be governed 
by the same general rules to which all science is subject 
and thus we are led by a close and natural connexion 
through a series of causes from those which regulate the 
imperceptible changes of the remotest nebulae in the 
heavens to those which determine the diversities of 
language the mutations of art and even the progress of 
civilization polity and literature 

while i have been speaking of this supposed series

of events including in its course the formation of the 
earthy the introduction of animal and vegetable life and 
the revolutions by which one collection of species has 
succeeded another it must not be forgotten that though 
i have thus hypothetically spoken of these events as 
occurring by force of natural causes this has been done 
only that the true efficacy of such causes might be 
brought under our consideration and made the subject of 
scientific examination it may be found that such oc 
currences as these are quite inexplicable by the aid of any 
natural causes with which we are acquainted and thus 
the result of our investigations conducted with strict 
regard to scientific principles may be that we must either 
contemplate supernatural influences as part of the past 
series of events or declare ourselves altogether unable to 
form this series into a connected chain 

 mode of ctdtivating jetioiogy — in geology — 
in what manner it may be asked is sltiology with 
regard to each subject such as we have enumerated to be 
cultivated in order to answer this question we must 
according to our method of proceeding take the most 
successful and complete examples which we possess of 
such portions of science but in truth we can as yet 
refer to few examples of this kind in geology it is 
only very recently and principally through the example 
and influence of mr lyell that the sitiology has been 
detached from the descriptive portion of the science 
and cultivated with direct attention in other sciences 
the separation has hardly yet been made but if we 
examine what has already been done in geological j£tio 
logy or as in the history it is termed geological 
dynamics we shall find a number of different kinds of 
investigation which by the aid of our general principles 
respecting the formation of sciences may suffice to sup 
ply very useful suggestions for etiology in general

in greological etiology causes have been studied in 
many instances by attending to their action in the phe 
nomena of the present state of things and by inferring 
from this the nature and extent of the action which they 
may have exercised in former times this has been 
done for example by von hoff mr lyell and others 
with regard to the operations of rivers seas springs 
glaciers and other aqueous causes of change again 
the same course has been followed by the same philoso 
phers with respect to volcanos earthquakes and other 
violent agents mr lyell has attempted to show too 
that there take place in our own time not only violent 
agitations but slow motions of parts of the earths crust 
of the same kind and order with those which have assisted 
in producing all anterior changes 

but while we thus seek instruction in the phenomena 
of the present state of things we are led to the question 
what are the limits of this present period for instance 
among the currents of lava which we trace as part of the 
shores of italy and sicily which shall we select as belong 
ing to the existing order of things in going backwards 
in time where shall we draw the line and why at such 
particular point these questions are important for our 
estimate of the efficacy of known causes will vary with the 
extent of the effects which we ascribe to them hence 
the mode in which we group together rocks is not only a 
step in geological classification but is also important to 
jitiology thus when the vast masses of trap rocks in 
the western isles of scotland and in other countries 
which had been maintained by the wemerians to be of 
aqueous origin were principally by the sagacity and 
industry of macculloch identified as to their nature with 
the products of recent volcanos the amount of effect 
which might justifiably be ascribed to volcanic agency 
was materially extended

h philosophy op palienology 

in other cases instead of observing the current effects 
of our geological causes we have to estimate the results 
from what we know of the causes themselves as when 
with herschel we calculate the alterations in the tem 
perature of the earth which astronomical changes may 
possibly produce or when with fourier we try to cal 
culate the rate of cooling of the earths surface on the 
hypothesis of an incandescent central mass in other 
cases again we are not able to calculate the effects of 
our causes rigorously but estimate them as well as we 
can partly by physical reasonings and partly by compa 
rison with such analogous cases as we can find in the 
present state of things thus mr lyell infers the change 
of climate which would result if land were transferred 
from the neighbourhood of the poles to that of the 
equator by reasonings on the power of land and water to 
contain and communicate heat supported by a reference 
to the different actual climates of places under the same 
latitude but under different conditions as to the distribu 
tion of land and water 

thus our etiology is constructed partly from calcu 
lation and reasoning partly from phenomena but we 
may observe that when we reason from phenomena to 
causes we usually do so by various steps often ascending 
fitm phenomena to mere laws of phenomena before we 
can venture to connect the phenomenon confidently with 
its cause thus the law of subterranean heat that it 
increases in descending below the surface is now well 
established although the doctrine which ascribes this 
effect to a central heat is not universally assented to 

 in the geography of plants and animals — we 
may find in other subjects also considerable contributions 
towards etiology though not as yet a complete system 
of science the etiology of vegetables and animals 
indeed has been studied with great zeal in modem times

as an essential preparative to geological theory for how 
can we decide whether any assumed causes have produced 
the succession of species which we find in the earths 
strata except we know what effect of this kind given 
causes can produce accordingly we find in mr 
lyeirs treatise on geology the most complete discussion 
of such questions as belong to these subjects — for ex 
ample the question whether species can be transmuted 
into other species by the long continued influence of 
external causes as climate food domestication combined 
with internal causes as habits appetencies progressive 
tendencies we may observe too that as we have 
brought before us the inquiry what change difference of 
climate can produce in any species we have also the 
inverse problem how far a different development of the 
species or a different collection of species proves a differ 
ence of climate in the same way the geologist of jhe 
present day considers the question whether in virtue of 
causes now in action species are from time to time extin 
guished and in like manner the geologists of an earlier 
period discussed the question nowlong completely decided 
whether fossil species in general are really extinct species 
 in languages — even with reference to the etio 
logy of language although this branch of science has 
hardly been considered separately from the glossological 
investigations in which it is employed or assumed to be 
employed it might perhaps be possible to point out 
causes or conditions of change which being general in 
their nature must operate upon all languages alike 
changes made for the sake of euphony when words are 
modified and combined occur in all dialects who can 
doubt that such changes of consonants as those by which 
the greek roots become gothic and the gothic german 
have for their cause some general principle in the pronun 
ciation of each language again we might attempt to

decide other questions of no small interest have the 
terminations of verbs arisen from the accretion of pro 
nouns or on the other hand does the modification of a 
verb imply a simpler mental process than the insulation 
of a pronoun as adam smith has maintained again 
when the language of a nation is changed by the invasion 
and permanent mixture of an enemy of different speech 
is it generally true that it is changed from a synthetic to 
an analytical structure i will mention only one more 
of these wide and general glossological inquiries is it 
true as dr prichard has suggested that languages have 
become more permanent as we come down towards later 
times may we justifiably suppose with him that in the 
very earliest times nations when they had separated from 
one stock might lose all traces of this common origin 
out of their languages though retaining strong evidences 
of it in their mythology social forms and arts as appears 
to be the case with the ancient egyptians and the 
indiansf 

large questions of this nature cannot be treated pro 
fitably in any other way than by an assiduous study of 
the most varied forms of living and dead languages but 
on the other hand the study of languages should be pro 
secuted not only by a direct comparison of one with 
another but also vith a view to the formation of a science 
of causes and general principles embracing such discus 
sions as i have pointed out it is only when such a 
science has been formed that we can hope to obtain any 
solid and certain results in the palsetiology of language 
— to determine with any degree of substantial proof 
what is the real evidence which the wonderful faculty of 
speech under its present developments and forms bears to 
the events which have taken place in its own history and 
in the history of man since his first origin

 comhmction of theories — when we have thus 
obtained with reference to any such subject as those we 
have here spoken of these two portions of science a 
systematic description of the facts and a rigorous analysis 
of the causes — the phenomenology and the jetiohgy of the 
subject — we are prepared for the third member which 
completes the science the theory of the actual facts 
we can then take a view of the events which really have 
happened discerning their connexion interpreting their 
evidence supplying from the context the parts which are 
unapparent we can account for known facts by intelli 
gible causes we can infer latent facts from manifest 
effects so as to obtain a distinct insight into the whole 
history of events up to the present time and to see the 
last result of the whole in the present condition of things 
the term theory when rigorously employed in such 
sciences as those which we here consider bears nearly the 
sense which i have adopted it implies a consistent and 
systematic view of the actual facts combined with a true 
apprehension of their connexion and causes thus if we 
speak of a theory of mount etna or a theory of the 
paris basin we mean a connected and intelligible view 
of the events by which the rocks in these localities have 
come into their present condition undoubtedly the 
term theory has often been used in a looser sense and 
men have put forth theories of tlie earthy which instead 
of including the whole mass of actual geological facts and 
their causes only assigned in a vague manner some 
causes by which some few phenomena might it was con 
ceived be accounted for perhaps the portion of our 
palaetiological sciences which we now wish to designate 
would be more generally understood if we were to describe 
it as titearetical or philosophical history as when we 
talk of the theoretical history of architecture or the 
philosophical history of language and in the same

 philosophy of paljetiology 

manner we might speak of the theoretical history of the 
animal and vegetable kingdoms meaning a distinct 
account of the events which have produced the present 
distribution of species and families but by whatever 
phrase we describe this portion of science it is plain that 
such a theory such a theoretical history must result 
from the application of causes well understood to facts 
well ascertained and if the term theory be here em 
ployed we must recollect that it is to be understood not 
in its narrower sense as opposed to facts but in its wider 
signification as including all known facts and differing 
from them only in introducing among them principles of 
intelligible connexion the theories of which we now 
speak are true theories precisely because they are 
identical with the total system of the facts 

 no sound paubtiological theory yet eatant — it is 
not to disparage the present state of science to say that 
as yet no such theory exists on any subject theories 
of the earth have been repeatedly published but when 
we consider that even the facts of geology have been 
observed only on a small portion of the earths surface 
and even within those narrow bounds very imperfectly 
studied we shall be able to judge how impossible it is 
that geologists should have yet obtained a wellestablished 
theoretical history of the changes which have taken 
place in the crust of the terrestrial globe from its first 
origin accordingly i have ventured in my history 
to designate the most prominent of the theories which 
have hitherto prevailed sis premature geological theories 
and we shall soon see that geological theory has not 
advanced beyond a few conjectures and that its culti 
vators are at present mainly occupied with a controversy 
in which the two extreme hypotheses which first offer 
themselves to mens minds are opposed to each other

and if we have no theoretical history of the earth which 
merits any confidence still less have we any theoretical 
history of language or of the arts which we can con 
sider as satisfactory the theoretical history of the 
vegetable and animal kingdoms is closely connected 
with that of the earth on which they subsist and must 
follow the fortunes of geology and thus we may ven 
ture to say that no palaetiological science as yet pos 
sesses all its three members indeed most of them are 
very far from having completed and systematized their 
phenomenology in all the cultivation of etiology is 
but just begun or is not begun in all the theory must 
reward the exertions of future probably of distant gene 
rations 

but in the mean time we may derive some instruction 
from the comparison of the two antagonist hypotheses of 
which i have spoken 



chapter iii 

of the doctrine of catastrophes and the 
doctrine of uniformity 

 doctrine of catastrophes — i have already shown 
in the history of geology that the attempts to frame a 
theory of the earth have brought into view two com 
pletely opposite opinions — one which represents the 
course of nature as uniform through all ages the causes 
which produce change having had the same intensity in 
former times which they have at the present day — the 
other opinion which sees in the present condition of 
things evidences of catastrophes changes of a more sweep 
ing kind and produced by more powerful agencies than 
those which occur in recent times geologists who held

the latter opinion maintained that the forces which have 
elevated the alps or the andes to their present height 
could not have been any forces which are now in action 
they pointed to vast masses of strata hundreds of miles 
long thousands of feet thick thrown into highlyinclined 
positions fractured dislocated crushed they remarked 
that upon the shattered edges of such strata they found 
enormous accumulations of fragments and rubbish 
rounded by the action of water so as to denote ages of 
violent aqueous action they conceived that they saw 
instances in which whole mountains of rock in a state of 
igneous fusion must have burst the earths crust from 
below they found that in the course of the revolutions 
by which one stratum of rock was placed upon another 
the whole collection of animal species which tenanted 
the earth and the seas had been removed and a new set 
of living things introduced in its place finally they 
found above all the strata vast masses of sand and gravel 
containing bones of animals and apparently the work of 
a mighty deluge with all these proofs before their eyes 
they thought it impossible not to judge that the agents 
of change by which the world was urged from one con 
dition to another till it reached its present state must 
have been more violent more powerful than any which 
we see at work around us they conceived that the 
evidence of catastrophes was irresistible 

 doctrine of uniformity — i need not here repeat 
the narrative given in the history of the process by 
which this formidable array of proofs was in the minds 
of some eminent geologists weakened and at last over 
come this was done by showing that the sudden breaks 
in the succession of strata were apparent only the dis 
continuity of the series which occurred in one country 
being removed by terms interposed in another locality

by urging that the total effect produced by existing 
causes taking into account the accumulated result of 
long periods is far greater than a casual speculator would 
think possible by making it appear that there are in 
many parts of the world evidences of a slow and imper 
ceptible rising of the land since it was the habitation of 
now existing species by proving that it is not univer 
sally true that the strata separated in time by supposed 
catastrophes contain distinct species of animals by 
pointing out the limited fields of the supposed diluvial 
action and finally by remarking that though the creation 
of species is a mystery the eminction of them is going on 
in our own day hypotheses were suggested too by 
which it was conceived that the change of climate might 
be explained which as the consideration of the fossil 
remains seemed to show must have taken place between 
the ancient and the modern times in this manner the 
whole evidence of catastrophes was explained away the 
notion of a series of paroxysms of violence in the causes 
of change was represented as a delusion arising from our 
contemplating short periods only in the action of present 
causes length of time was called in to take the place of 
intensity of force and it was declared that geology need 
not despair of accounting for the revolutions of the earth 
as astronomy accounts for the revolutions of the heavens 
by the universal action of causes which are close at hand 
to us operating through time and space without variation 
or decay 

an antagonism of opinions somewhat of the same 
kind as this will be found to manifest itself in the other 
palsetiological sciences as well as in geology and it will 
be instructive to endeavour to balance these opposite 
doctrines i will mention some of the considerations 
which bear upon the subject 

 is uniformity frcbable a priori — the doctrine of 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 philosophy op palibtiolooy 

uniformity in the course of nature has sometimes been 
represented by its adherents as possessing a great degree 
of a priori probability it is highly unphilosophical it 
has been urged to assume that the causes of the geolo 
gieal events of former times were of a different kind from 
causes now in action if causes of this latter kind can in 
any way be made to explain the facts the analogy of 
all other sciences compels us it was said to explain phe 
nomena by known not by unknown causes and on 
these grounds the geological teacher recommended an 
earnest and patient endeavour to reconcile the indications 
of former change with the evidence of gradual mutations 
now in progress 

but on this we may remark that if by known causes 
we mean causes acting with the same intensity which 
they have had during historical times the restriction is 
altogether arbitrary and groundless let it be granted 
for instance that many parts of the earths surface are 
now undergoing an imperceptible rise it is not pre 
tended that the rate of this elevation is rigorously uni 
form what then are the limits of its velocity why may 
it not increase so as to assume that character of violence 
which we may term a catastrophe with reference to all 
changes hitherto recorded why may not the rate of 
elevation be such that we may conceive the strata to 
assume suddenly a position nearly vertical and is it in 
foct easy to conceive a position of strata nearly vertical 
a position which occurs so frequently to be gradtwutf 
assumed in cases where the strata are nearly verticd 
as in the isle of wight and hundreds of other places or 
where they are actually inverted as sometimes occurs are 
not the causes which have produced the effect as truly 
known causes as those which have raised the coasts where 
we trace the former beach in an elevated terrace if 

 lybll b iv p

doctrines of catastrophes and of uniformity 

the latter case proves slow elevation does not the former 
case prove rapid elevation in neither case have we any 
measure of the time employed in the change but does 
not the very nature of the results enable us to discern 
that if one was gradual the other was comparatively 
sudden 

the causes which are now elevating a portion of 
scandinavia can be called known causes only because we 
know the effect are not the causes which have elevated 
the alps and the andes known causes in the same sense 
we know nothing in either case which confines the 
intensity of the force within any limit or prescribes to it 
any law of uniformity why then should we make a 
merit of cramping our speculations by such assumptions 
whether the causes of change do act uniformly — 
whether they oscillate only within narrow limits— 
whether their intensity in former times was nearly the 
same as it now is — these are precisely the questions 
which we wish nature to answer to us impartially and 
truly where is then the wisdom of an earnest and 
patient endeavour to secure an affirmauve reply 

thus i conceive that the assertion of an a priori 
claim to probability and philosophical spirit in favour of 
the doctrine of uniformity is quite untenable we must 
learn from an examination of all the facts and not from 
any assumption of our own whether the course of nature 
be uniform the limit of intensity being really unknown 
catastrophes are just as probable as uniformity if a 
volcano may repose for a thousand years and then break 
out and destroy a city why may not another volcano 
repose for ten thousand years and then destroy a con 
tinent or if a continent why not the whole habitable 
surce of the earth 

 cycle of uniformity indefinitevlt this argument 
may be put in another form when it is said that the 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 philosophy of palietiology 

course of nature is uniform the assertion is not intended 
to exclude certain smaller variations of violence and rest 
such as we have just spoken of — alternations of activity 
and repose in volcanos or earthquakes deluges and 
storms interposed in a more tranquil state of things 
with regard to such occurrences terrible as they appear 
at the time they may not much affect the average rate 
of change there may be a cyclcy tliough an irregular one 
of rapid and slow change and if such cycles go on suc 
ceeding each other we may still call the order of nature 
uniform notwithstanding the periods of violence which 
it involves the maximum and minimum intensities of 
the forces of mutation alternate with one another and we 
may estimate the average course of nature as that which 
corresponds to something between the two extremes 

but if we thus attempt to maintain the uniformity of 
nature by representing it as a series of cycles we find 
that we cannot discover in this conception any solid 
ground for excluding catastrophes what is the length 
of that cycle the repetition of which constitutes uni 
formity what interval from the maximum to the 
minimum does it admit of we may take for our cycle 
a hundred or a thousand years but evidently such a pro 
ceeding is altogether arbitrary we may mark our cycles 
by the greatest known paroxysms of volcanic and terre 
motive agency but this procedure is no less indefinite 
and inconclusive than the other 

but further since the cycle in which violence and 
repose alternate is thus indefinite in its length and in its 
range of activity what ground have we for assuming 
more than one such cycle extending from the origin of 
things to the present time why may we not suppose 
the maximum force of the causes of change to have taken 
place at the earliest period and the tendency towards the 
minimum to have gone on ever since or instead of 



digitized by vjooq ic 



doctrines of catastrophes and of uniforhmr 

only one cycle there may have been several but of such 
length that our historical period forms a portion only of 
the last — the feeblest portion of the latest cycle and 
thus violence and repose may alternate upon a scale of 
time and intensity so large that mans experience sup 
plies no evidence enabling him to estimate the amount 
the course of things is umfcrm to an intelligence which 
ean embrace the succession of several cycles but it is 
ixttastropkic to the contemplation of man whose survey 
san grasp a part only of one cycle and thus the hypo 
thesis of uniformity since it cannot exclude degrees of 
diange nor limit the range of these degrees nor define 
the interval of their recurrence cannot possess any essen 
tial simjdicity which previous to inquiry gives it a claim 
upon our assent superior to that of the opposite cata 
strophic hypothesis 

 uniformitarian arguments are negative onfy 
there is an opposite tendency in the mode of maintaining 
the catastrophist and the uniformitarian opinions which 
depends upon their fundamental principles and shows 
itself in all the controversies between them the cata 
strophist is affirmative the uniformitarian is negative in 
his assertions the former is constantly attempting to 
construct a theory the latter delights in demolishing all 
theories the one is constantly bringing fresh evidence

toy mn fir believing it altogether untenable other 
penons also desirotui of reconoiling thii subterraueoua 
heat with the tenet of uniformity have offered another 
suggestion — that the warmth of incandeaoenee of the 
interior parts of the earth does not iorise out of an oii 
ginally hot oondition from which it is gradually eooling 
but results from chemical action oonistantly going on 
among the materials of the earths substance and thus 
new attempts are perpetually making to escape from the 
cogency of the reasonings which send us towards an ori 
ginal state of things different from the iesent those 
who theorize concerning an origin go on building up the 
bric of their speculations while those who think such 
theories unpbilosophical ever and anon dig away the 
foundation of this structure as we have already said the 
uniformitarians doctrines are a collection of negatives 

this is so entirely the case that the uniformitarian 
would for the most part shrink from nuuntaining as 
positive tenets the explanations which he so willingly 
uses as instrutnents of controversy he puts forward his 
suggestions as difficulties but he will not stand by them 
as doctrines and this is in accordance with his general 
tendency for any of his hypotheses if insisted upon as 
positive theories would be found inconsistent with the 
assertion of uniformity for example the nebular hypo 
thesis appears to give to the history of the heavens an 
aspect which obliterates all special acts of creatiob 
for aeeording to that hypothesis new planetary systenm 
are eonstently forming but when asserted as the origin 
of our own solar system it brings with it an original 
incandesoenee and an origin of the organic world and 
if instead of using the chemical theory of subterrweons 
heat to neutralim the evidence of original incandescence 
we assert it as a positive tenet we ean no longer mau

tain the infinite past duration of the earth for chemical 
forces as well as mechanical tend to equilibrium and 
that condition once attained their efficacy ceases che 
mical affinities tend to form new compounds and though 
when many and various elements are mingled together 
the play of synthesis and analysis may go on for a long 
time it must at last end if for instance a large por 
tion of the earths mass were originally pure potassium 
we can imagine violent igneous action to go on so long 
as any part remained unoxidized but when the oxidation 
of the whole has once taken place this action must be 
at an end for there is in the hypothesis no agency 
which can reproduce the deoxidized metal thus a per 
petual motion is impossible in chemistry as it is in 
mechanics and a theory of constant change continued 
through infinite time is untenable when asserted upon 
chemical no less than upon mechanical principles and 
thus the scepticism of the uniformitarian is of force only 
so long as it is employed against the dogmatism of the 
catastrophist when the doubts are erected into dogmas 
they are no longer consistent with the tenet of unifor 
mity when the negations become affirmations the 
negation of an origin vanishes also 

 uniformity in the organic world — in speaking of 
the violent and sudden changes which constitute cata 
strophes our thoughts naturally turn at first to great 
mechanical and physical effects — ruptures and displace 
ments of strata extensive submersions and emersions of 
land rapid changed of temperature but the catastrophes 
which we have to consider in geology affect the organic as 
well as the inorganic world the sudden extinction of one 
collection of species ahd the introduction of another in 
their place is a catastrophe even if unaccompanied by 
mechaniol violence accordingly the antagonism of

itself in this department of the subject as well as in the 
other when geologists had first discovered that the 
successive strata are each distinguished by appropri 
ate organic fossils they assumed at once that each of 
these collections of living things belonged to a separate 
creation but this conclusion as i have already said 
mr lyell has attempted to invalidate by proving that in 
the existing order of things some species become extinct 
and by suggesting it as possible that in the same order it 
may be true that new species are from time to time pro 
duced even in the present course of nature and in 
this as in the other part of the subject he calls in the 
aid of vast periods of time in order that the violence of 
the changes may be softened down land he appeara dis 
posed to believe that the actual extinction and creation 
of species may be so slow as to excite no more notice 
than it has hitherto obtained and yet may be rapid 
enough considering the immensity of geological periods 
to produce such a succession of different collections of 
species as we find in the strata of the earths surface 

 origin of the present organic wrldthe last 
great event in the history of the vegetable and animal 
kingdoms was that by which their various tribes were 
placed in their present seats and we may form vari 
ous hypotheses with regard to the sudden or gradual 
manner in which we may suppose this distribution to 
have taken place we may assume that at the begin 
ning of the present order of things a stock of each species 
was placed in the vegetable or animal province to which 
it belongs by some cause out of the common order of 
nature or we may take a uniformitariari view of the 
subject and suppose that the provinces of the organic 
world derived their population from some anterior state 
of things by the operation of natural causes

t things which has any analogy ot resemblance of any 
talid kind to that creative energy which must be exerted 
in tiie production of a new species and to assume die 
introduction of new species as a part of the order of 
nature without pointing out any natural fact with which 
such an event can be classed would be to reject creation 
by an arbitrary act hence even on natural grounds the 
most intelligible view of the history of the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms seeitas to be that each period which 
is marked by a distinct collection of species forms a cycle 
and that at th bpinning of each such cycle a creative 
power was exerted of a kind to which there was nothing 
at all analogous in the succeeding part of the same cycle 
if it be uiged that in some cases the same species or the 
same genus runs through two geological formations which 
mam on other grounds foe referred to differit cycles of 
ereative energy we may reply dutt the creation of many 
sew qiecies does not imply the extinction of all the old 
ones 

thus we are led by our reasonings to this view that 
as present order of things was commenced by an act of 
creative power entirely diffent to any agency which has 
been exerted since none of the influences which have 
modified the present races of animals and plants since 
they were placed in their habitations on the earths muv 
fitee can have had any efficacy in producing them at first 
we are necessarily driven to assume as the banning of 
the present cycle of organic nature an evit not inclqded

many of the differences and changes whidi we become

change which still operate but what glossologist will 
venture to dedare tliat the efficacy of such causes has 
been udifnn that the influences which mould a lan

proof how little the history of languages suggests to the 
philosophical glossologist the persuasion of a uniform 
action of the causes of change i may refer to the 
conjecture of dr prichard that the varieties of language 
produced by the separation of one stock into several 
have been greater and greater as we go backwards in 
history — that the formation of sister dialects from a 
common language as the scandinavian german and 
saxon dialects from the teutonic or the gaelic erse and 
welsh from the celtic belongs to the first millennium 
before the christian era while the formation of cognate 
languages of the same mily as the sanskrit latin qreek 
and gothic must be placed at least two thousand years 
before that era and at a still earlier period took place 
the separation of the great families themselves the indo 
european semitic and others in which it is now diffi 
cult to trace the features of a common origin no 
hypothesis except one of this kind will explain the exiuir 
ence of the families groups and dialects of languages 
which we find in existence yet this is an entirely dif 
ferent view from that which the hypothesis of the uniform 
progress of change would give and thus in the earliest 
stages of mans career the revolutions of language must 
have been even by the evidence of the theoretical his 
tory of language itself of an order altogether different 
from any which have taken place within the recent 
history of man and we may add that as the early 
stages of the progress of language must have been widely 
different from those later ones of which we can in some 
measure trace the natural causes we cannot place the 
origin of language in any point of view in which it comes 
under the jurisdiction of natural causation at all

in no palsetiological science has man been able to arrive 
at a beginning trhich is homogeneous with the known 
course of events we can in such sciences often go very 
far back — determine many of the remote circumstances 
of the past series of events — ascend to a point which 
seems to be near the origin — and limit the hypotheses re 
specting the origin itself — but philosophers never have 
demonstlfatedy and so r as we can judge probably never 
will be able to demonstrate what was that primitive state 
of things from which the progressive course of the world 
took its first departure in all these paths of reseimh 
when we travel far backwards the aspect of the earlier 
portions becomes very different froiri that of the advanced 
part on which we now stand but in all cases the path is

the reach of human history have a stroi interest for 
the palaetiologist nor is he less concerned in all recorded 
instances of the modification of the forms and habits of 
plants and animals by the operations of man or by 
transfer from one land to another and when we come 
to the palaetiology of language of art of civilization 
we find our subject still more closely connected with 
history for in truth these are historical no less than 
palsetiological investigations but confining ourselves at 
present to the material sciences we may observe that 
though the importuice of the information which tradition 
gives us in the sciences now under our consideration as 
ior instance geology has long been tacitly recognised yet 
it is only recentiy that geologists have employed themselves 
in collecting their historical iacts upon such a scale and 
with such comprehensive views as are required by the 
interest and use of collections of this kind the essay 
of von hofi oh the nahmi auerauom in tie surfwe 
of the earth which are proved by tradition was the work 
which first opened the eyes of geologists to the extent 
and importance of this kind of investigation since that 
time the same path of research has been pursued with 
great perseverance by others especially by mr lyell 
and is now justly considered as an essential portion of 
geology

which an examination of the earths surface and of its 
tegetable and animal population discloses to us such 
eontroyersies when they are considered as merely arcbseo 
logical may occur in any of the palsetiological sciences 
we may have to compare and to reconcile the evidence 
of existing phenomena with that of historical tradition 
but under some ciroumstances this process of conciliation 
may lussume an interest of another kind on which we 
wiu make a few remarks

we may contemplate the existence of man upon the 
earth his origin and his progress in the same manner as 
we contemplate the existence of any other race of ani 
mals namely in a purely palsological view we may 
eonsid how hx our knowledge of laws of causation 
enables us to exfdain his diflbsion and migration his 
direnoes and resemblances his actions and works and 
this is the view of man as a member of the natural course 
of things 

bt man at the same time the contemplator and the 
subject of his own contemplation endowed with cul 
ties and powers which make him a being of a different 
nature from other animals cannot help regarding his own 
actions and enjoyments his recollections and his hopes 
under an aspect quite different from any thst we have 
yt had presented to us we have been endeavouring 
to place in a clear light the fundamental ideas such as 
thai of oatse on which dends our knowledge f the

idiich man necessarily refers his actions he is led by 
his nature not only to consider his own actions and

he has ideas of moral relations as well as those ideas of 
material relations with which we have hitherto been 
occupied he is a moral as well as a natural agent 

contemplating himself and the world around him 
by the light of his moral ideas man is led to the convic 
tion that his moral faculties were bestowed upon him by 
design and for a purpose that he is the subject of a 
moral government that the course of the world is 
directed by tlie power which governs it to the unfolding 
and perfecting of mans moral nature that this guid 
ance may be traced in the career of individuals and of 
the world that there is a providential as well as a natural 
course of things 

yet this view is beset by no small difficulties the 
full development of mans moral faculties — the perfection 
of his nature up to the measure of his own ideas — the 
adaptation of his moral being to an ultimate destiaation 
by its transit through a world full of moral evil in which 
each has his share — are effects for which the economy of 
the world appeara to contain no adequate provision 
man though aware of his moral nature and ready to 
believe in an ultimate destination of purity and blessed 
ness is too feeble to resist the temptation of evil and to 
restore his purity when once lost he cannot but look 
for some confirmation of that providential order which he 
has begun to believe some provision for those defi 
ciencies in his moral condition which he has begun to feel 

he looks at the history of the world and he finds 
that at a certain period it offers to him the promise of 
what he seeks when the natural powers of man had 
been developed to their full extent and were beginning 
to exhibit symptoms of decay when the intellectual 
progress of the world appeared to have reached its limit 
without supplying mans moral needs we find the great 
epoch in the providential history of the world we

find the announcement of a dispensation by which mans 
deficiencies shall be supplied and his aspirations ful 
filled we find a provision for the purification the support 
and the ultimate beatification of those who use the pro 
vided means and thus the providential course of the 
world becomes consistent and intelligible 

 the sacred narrative — but with the new dispen 
sation we receive not only an account of its own scheme 
and history but also a written narrative of the providen 
tial course of the world from the earliest times and even 
from its first creation this narrative is recognized and 
authorized by the new dispensation and accredited by 
some of the same evidences as the dispensation itself 
that the existence of such a sacred narrative should be a 
part of the providential order of things cannot but appear 
natural but naturally also the study of it leads to some 
difficulties 

the sacred narrative in some of its earliest portions 
speaks of natural objects and occurrences respecting 
them in the very beginning of the course of the world 
we may readily believe indeed as we have seen in the 
last chapter our scientific researches lead us to believe 
that such occurrences were very different from anything 
which now takes place — different to an extent and in a 
manner which we cannot estimate now the narrative 
must speak of objects and occurrences in the words and 
phrases which have derived their meaning from their ap 
plication to the existing natural state of things when 
applied to an initial supernatural state therefore th€w 
words and phrases cannot help being to us obscure and 
mysterious perhaps ambiguous and seemingly contra 
dictory

relationb tt at first we may well suppose he will aocpt 
the sacred narrative as not only unquestionable in it

which he entertains of objects and their properties so 
that the sacred narrative of the supernatural condition 
shall retain the first meaning which he had put upon it in 
virtue of his own habits in the usage of language 

but man is so constituted that he cannot persist in 
this procedure the powers and tendencies of his intel 
lect are such that he cannot help trying to attain tru 
conceptions of objects and their properties by the study 
of things themselves for instance when he at first 
read of a firmament dividing the waters above from the 
waters below he perhaps conceived a transparent floor in 
the skies on which the superior waters rested which 
descend in rain but as his observations and his reason 
ings satisfied him that such a floot could not exist he 
became willing to allow as st augustine allowed that 
the waters above the firmament are in a state of vapour 
and in like manner in other subjects men as their views 
of nature became more distinct and precise modified so 
far as it was necessary for consistencys sake their first 
rude interjretations of the sacred narrative so that with 
out in any degree losing its import as a view of th 
providential course of the world it should be so conceived 
as not to contradict what they knew of the natural onto 
of things 

but this accommodation was not always made without 
painful struggles and angry controversies when men 
had conceived the occurrences of the sacred narrative m 
a particular manner they could not readily and willingly 
adopt a new mode of conception and they resisted all 
attempts to recommend it to them as attacks upon the 
sacredness of the narrative they had clothed tbiir

remark that such modifications of the current interpre 
tation of the words of scripture appear to be an inevitable 
consequence of the progressive character of natural 
science science is constantly teaching us to describe 
ksown fiiets in new language but the language of script 
tare is always the same and not only so but the ian 
guage of scripture is necessarily adapted to the common 
state of mans intellectual development in which he i 
supposed not to be possessed of science hence the 
phrases used by scripture are precisely those which science 
soon teaches man to consider as inaccurate yet they 
are not on that account the less fitted for their proper 
purpose for if any terms had been used adapted to a more 
advanced state of knowledge they must have been unin

addressed if the jews had been told that water existed 
in the clouds in small drops they would have marvelled 
that it did not constantly descend and to have explained 
the nason of this would have been to teach atmology in 
the sacred writings if thej had read in their scripture 
that the earth was a sphere when it appeared to be a 
plain they would only have been disturbed in their 
thoughts or driven to some wild and baseless imagina 
tions by a declaration to them so strange if the divine 
speaker instead of saying that he would set his bow in 
the clouds had been made to declare that he would 
give to water the property of refracting different colours 
at different angles how utterly unmeaning to the hearers 
would the words have been and in these cases the 
expressions being unintelligiue startling and bewilder 
ing would have been such as tended to uuftt the saered 
narrative for its place in the providitial dispensation of 
the world 

accordingly in the great controversy which took 
place in galileos time between tixe defenders of the then 
customary interpretations of scripture and the assertora 
of the copemican system of the universe when the innck 
vatoi were upbraided with maintaining opinions contrary 
to scripture they replied that scripture was not intended 
to teach men astronomy and that it expressed the acts of 
divine power in images which were suited to the ideas of 
unscientific men to speak of the rising and setting and 
travelling of the sun of the fixity and of the foundations 
of the earth was to use the only language which would 
have made the sacred narrative intelligiue to fextract 
from these and the like expressions doctrines of science 
was they declared in the highest degree unjustifiable and 
such a course could lead they held to no result but a 
weakening of the authority of scripture in proportion as

applying it and this judgment has since been generally 
assented to by those who most reverence and value the 
study of the designs of providence as well as that of the 
works of nature 

 science tells us nothing concerning creation — other 
apparent difficulties arise from the accounts given in 
the scripture of the first origin of the world in which 
we live for example light is represented as created 
before the sun with regard to difficulties of this kind 
it appears that we may derive some instruction from the 
result to which we were led in the last chapter — namely 
that in the sciences which trace the progress of natural 
occurrences we can in no case go back to an origin but 
in every instance appu to find ourselves separated from 
it by a state of things and an order of events of a kind 
altogether difierent from those which come under our 
experience the thread of induction respecting the 
natural course of the world snaps in our fingers when we 
try to ascertain where its beginning is since then 
science can teach us nothing positive respecting the 
beginning of things she can neither contradict nor con 
firm what is taught by scripture on that subject and 
thus as it is unworthy timidity to fear contradiction so 
is it ungrounded presumption to look for confirmation in 
such cases the providential history of the world has its 
own beginning and its own evidence and we can only 
render the system insecure by making it lean on our 
material sciences if any one were to suggest that the 
nebular hypothesis countenances the scripture history of 
the formation of this system by showing how the lumi 
nous matter of the sun might exist previous to the sun 
itself we should act wisely in rejecting such an attempt 
to weave together these two heterogeneous threads — 
the one a part of a providential scheme the other a frag 
ment of physical speculation

this purpose to bring forwards any sulijects which are

that such maxims as we are now endeayouring to establish 
and the one before us in particular bear with a peculiar 
force upon those palsetiological sciences of which we haye

 scientific tiews when familiar do not disturb the

litruggles which thus take place between those who main

those who contend for such new ones as the new dis 
ioyeiles of science require it is this — that though the 
fiew opinion is resisted by one party as something 
destmotiye of the credit of scripture and the reyerence 
which is its due yet in fact when the new interpretation 
has been generally established and incorporated with 
mens current thoughts it ceases to disturb their yiews 
of the authority of the scripture or of the truth of its 
teaching when the language of scripture inyested 
with its new meaning has become fitmiliar to men it is

revcve round it would be interfered with by an acknow

and thus the authority of revelation is not shaken by 
aay dianges introduced by the progress of science in the 
piode of interpreting expressions which describe physical 
olts and occurrences protided the new interpretation 
is admitted at a proper season and in a proper spirit 
so as to soften as mudi as possible both the public con 
itroversies and the private scruples which almost inevit 
ably accompany such an alteration 

 when hom old interpretations be given upfni 
tha question then occurs what is the proper season for 
a religious and enlightened commentator to make such 
a change ip the current interpretation of sacred scrip 
ture at what period ought the established exposition 
of a passage to be given up and a new mode of underr 
standing the passage such as is or seems to be required 
by new discoveries respecting the laws of nature accepted 
in its place it is jain that to introduce such an alter 
ation lightly and hastily would be a procedure fraught 
with inconvenience for if the change we made in such 
a manner it ntiight be afterwards discovered that it had 
been adojd without sufficient reason and that it was 
neoessaity to reidstltte the old exposition and the minds 
of the readers of scripture always to a certain extent 
and for a time disturbed by the subversion of their long 
establied notions would be distressed without any 
need and might be seriously unsettled while on the 
other hand a too protracted and obstinate resistance to 
the innovation on the part of the scriptural expositors 
would tend to identify at least in the minds of many 
the authority of the scripture with the truth of the expo 
sition and therefore would bring discredit upcm the

revealed word when the established interpretation was 
finally proved to be untenable 

a rule on this subject propounded by some of the most 
enlightened dignitaries of the roman catholic church 
on the occasion of the great copemican controversy 
begun by gralileo seems well worthy of our attention 
the following was the opinion given by cardinal bellar 
mine at the time — when a demonstration shall be 
found to establish the earths motion it will be proper to 
interpret the sacred scriptures otherwise than they have 
hitherto been interpreted in those passages where men 
tion is made of the stability of the earth and movement 
of the heavens this appears to be a judicious and 
reasonable maxim for such cases in general so long as 
the supposed scientific discovery is doubtful the exposi 
tion of the meaning of scripture given by commentators 
of established credit is not wantonly to be disturbed 
but when a scientific theory irreconcileable with this 
ancient interpretation is clearly proved we must give up 
the interpretation and seek some new mode of under 
standing the passage in question by means of which it 
may be consistent with what we know for if it be not 
our conception of the things so described is no longer 
consistent with itself 

it may be said that tiiis rule is indefinite for who 
shall decide when a new theory is completely demon 
strated and the old interpretation become untenable 
but to this we may reply that if the rule be assented to 
its application will not be very difficult for when men 
have admitted as a general rule that the current inter 
pretations of scriptural expressions respecting natural 
objects and events may possibly require and in some 
cases certainly will require to be abandoned and new 
ones admitted they will hardly allow themselves to con 
tend for such interpretations as if they were essential

parts of revelation and will look upon the change of 
exposition whether it come sooner or later without 
alarm or anger and when men lend themselves to the 
progress of truth in this spirit it is not of any material 
importance at what period a new and satisfactory inter 
pretation of the scriptural diflsculty is found since a 
scientific exactness in our apprehension of the meaning 
of such passages as are now referred to is very far from 
being essential to our full acceptance of revelation 

 in what spirit shoidd the change be accepted — 
still these revolutions in scriptural interpretation must 
always have in them something which distresses and dis 
turbs religious communities and such uneasy feelings 
will take a different shape according as the community 
acknowledges or rejects a paramount interpretative 
authority in its religious leaders in the case in which 
the interpretation of the church is binding upon all its 
members the more placid minds rest in peace upon the 
ancient exposition till tlie spiritual authorities announce 
that the time for the adoption of a new view has arrived 
but in these circumstances the more stirring and inqui 
sitive minds which cannot refrain from the pursuit of 
new truths and exact conceptions are led to opinions 
which being contrary to those of the church are held 
to be sinful on the other hand if the religious constitu 
tion of the community allow and encourage each man to 
study and interpret for himself the sacred writings we 
are met by evils of another kind in this case although 
by the unforced influence of admired commentators there 
may prevail a general agreement in the usual interpreta 
tion of difficult passages yet as each reader of the scrip 
ture looks upon the sense which he has adopted as being 
his own interpretation he maintains it not with the 
tranquil acquiescence of one who has deposited his judg 
ment in the hands of his church but with the keenness

and btrenuousness of selflove in such a state of things 
though no judicial severities can be employed against the 
innovators there may arise more angry controversies than 
in the other case 

it is impossible to overlook the lesson vhich here 
offers itself that it is in the highest degree unwise in 
the friends of religion whether individuals or commu 
nities unnecessarily to embark their credit in expositions 
of scripture on matters which appertain to natural 
science by delivering physical doctrines as the teaching 
of revelation religion may lose much but cannot gain 
anything tliis maxim of practical wisdom has often 
been urged by christian vmters thus st augustin 
says in obscure matters and things far removed from 
our senses if we read anything even in the divine 
scripture which may produce diverse opinions without 
damaging the faith which we cherish let us not rush 
headlong by positive assertion to either the one opinion 
or the other lest when a more thorough discussion has 
shown the opinion which we had adopted to be false our 
faith may fall with it and we should be found con 
tending not for the doctrine of the sacred scriptures but 
for our own endeavouring to make our doctrine to be 
that of the scriptures instead of taking the doctrine of 
the scriptures to be ours and in nearly the same 
spirit at the time of the copemican controversy it was 
thought proper to append to the work of copernicus a 
postil to say that the work was written to account fop 
the phenomena and that people must not run on blindly 
and condemn either of the opposite opinions even vrhefa 
the inquisition in thought itself compelled to 
pronounce a decision upon this subject the verdict was 
delivered in very moderate language — that the doctrine 
of the earths motion appeared to be contrary to scrip

interpreters of scripture may most safely and most pro

forget that there may be errors committed on the other 
side also and that men of science in bringing forward 
views which may for a time disturb the minds of lovers 
of scripture should consider themselves as bound by 
strict rules of candour moderation and prudence in 
tentiooally to make their supposed discoveries a means 
of discrediting contradicting or slighting the sacred 
scriptures or tiiie authority of religion is in them unpar

thing to nle is tbe inquisition which allows the smallness 
of the earth but denies its motion but more holy to me 
is truth and hence i prove from philosophy that the 
earth is round and inhabited on every side of small size 
and in motion among the stars — and this i do with no 
disrespect to the doctors i the more willingly quote such 
a passage from kepler because the entire ingenuousness 
and sincere piety of his character does not allow us to 
suspect in him anything of hypocrisy or latent irony 
that similar professions of respect may be made ironic 
cally we have a noted example in the celebrated intro 
duction to galueds dialogue on the copemican system 
probably the part which was most offensive to the autho 
rities some years ago he begins a wholesome edict 
was promulgated at rome which in order to check the 
perilous scandals of the present age imposed silence upon 
the pythagorean opinion of the mobility of the earth 
there were not wanting he proceeds persons who 
rashly asserted that this decree was the result not of a 
judicious inquiry but of passion illinformed and com 
plaints were heard that counsellors utterly unacquainted 
with astronomical observation ought not to be allowed 
with their sudden prohibitions to clip the wings of spe 
culative intellects at the jieahng of rash lamentations 
like these my zeal could not keep silence and he then 
goes on to say that he wishes in his dialogue to show 
that the subject had been fully examined at rome 
here the irony is quite transparent and the sarcasm 
glaringly obvious i think we may venture to say that 
this is not the temper in which scientific questions should 
be treated although by some perhaps the prohibitichi of 
pubhe discussion may be considered as justifying any 
evasion which is likely to pass unpunished 

 dttfy of mutual forbearance — we may add as a 
further reason for niutual forbearance in such cases that

the true interests of boui parties are the same the man 
of science is concerned no less than any other person in 
the troth and import of the divine dispensation the reli 
gious man no less than the man of science is by the 
nature of his intellect incapable of believing two contra 
dictory declarations hence they have both alike a need 
for understanding the scripture in some way in which it 
shall be consistent with their understanding of nature 
it is for their common advantage to conciliate as kepler 
says the finger and the tongue of god his works and 
his word and they may find abundant reason to bear 
with each other even if they should adopt for this pur 
pose different interpretations each finding one satisfactory 
to himself or if any one should decline employing his 
thoughts on such subjects at all i have elsewhere 
quoted a passage from kepler f which appears to me 
written in a most suitable spirit i beseech my reader 
that not unmindful of the divine goodness bestowed upon 
man he do with me praise and celebrate the wisdom of 
the creator which i open to him from a more inward 
explication of the form of the world from a searching of 
causes from a detection of the errors of vision and that 
thus not only in the firmness and stability of the earth may 
we perceive with gratitude the preservation of all living 
things in nature as the gift of god but also that in its 
motion so recondite so admirable we may acknowledge 
the wisdom of the creator but whoever is too dull to 
receive this science or too weak to believe the coper 
nican system without harm to hi piety him i say i 
advise that leaving the school of astronomy and con 
demning if so he please any doctrines of the philosophers 
he follow his own path and desist from this wandering 
through the universe and that lifting up his natural 
eyes with which alone he can see he pour himself out

from his own heart in worship of god the creator being 
certain that he gives no less worship to god than the 
astronomer to whom god has given to see more clearly 
with his inward eyes and who from what he has himself 
discovered both can and will glorify god 

 case of galileo — i may perhaps venture here to 
make a remark or two upon this subject with reference 
to a charge brought against a certain portion of the his 
tort of the inductive sciences complaint has been made 
that the character of the roman church as shown in its 
behaviour towards galileo is misrepresented in the ac 
count given of it in the history of astronomy it is 
asserted that galileo provoked the condemnation he 
incurred first by pertinaciously demanding the assent 
of the ecclesiastical authorities to his opinion of the con 
sistency of the copernican doctrine with scripture and 
afterwards by contumaciously and as we have seen con 
tumeliously violating the silence which the church had 
enjoined upon him it is further declared that the 
statement which represents it as the habit of the roman 
church to dogmatize on points of natural science is im 
founded as well as the opinion that in consequence of 
this habit new scientific truths were promulgated less 
boldly in italy than in other countries i shall reply very 
briefly on these subjects for the decision of thism is by 
no means requisite in order to establish the doctrines to 
which i have been led in the present chapter nor i hope 
to satisfy my reader that my views have been collected 
from an impartial consideration of scientific history 

with regard to galileo i do not think it can be 
denied that he obtruded his opinions upon the ecclesias 
tical authorities in an unnecessary and imprudent manner 
he was of an ardent character strongly convinced him 
self and urged on still more by the conviction which he

jroduced among his disciples and thus he became impa 
tient for the triumph of truth this judgment of him has 
recently been delivered by various independent autho 
rities and has undoubtedly considerable foundation as 
to the question whethw authority in matters of natural 
science were habitually claimed by the authorities of the 
church of rome i have to allow that i cannot produce 
instances which establish such a habit we who have 
been accustomed to have daily before our eyes the moni 
tion which the romish editors of newton thought it 
necessary to prefix — ccterum latis a summo pontifice con 
tra telluris motum decretisy nos obsequi profitemur — were 
not likely to conjecture that this was a solitary instance 
of the interposition of the papal authority on such sub 
jects but although it would be easy to find declarations 
of heresy delivered by romish universities and writers 
of great authority against tenets belonging to the natural 
sciences i am not aware that any other case can be 
adduced in which the church or the pope can be shown 
to have pronounced such a sentence i am well con 
tented to acknowledge this for i should be far more 
gratified by finding myself compelled to hold up the 
seventeenth century as a model for the nineteenth in this 
respect than by having to sow enmity between the 
admirers of the past and the present through any dispa 
raging contrast f 

 besides the dublin review i may quote the edinburgh bemewy 
which i suppose will not be thought likely to have a bias in favour of 
the exereise of eoclesiastical authority in matters of science though 
certainly there is a puerility in the critics phraseology which does not 
add to the weight of his judgment galileo contrived to surround 
the tnith with every variety of obstruction the tide of knowledge 
which had hitherto advanced in eace he crested with angry breakers 
and he involved in its surf both his friends and his foes — ed rev

with respect to the attempt made in my history to 
characterize the intellectual habits of italy as produced by 
her religious condition— certainly it would ill become any 
student of the history of science to speak slightingly of 
that country always the mother of sciences always ready 
to catch the dawn and hail the rising of any new light of 
knowledge but i think our admiration of this activity 
and acuteness of mind is by no means inconsistent with 
the opinion that new truths were promulgated more 
boldly beyond the alps and that the subtilty of the 
italian intellect loved to insinuate what the rough grer 
man bluntly asserted of the decent duplicity with which 
forbidden opinions were handled the reviewer himself 
gives us instances when he boasts of the liberality with 
which copemican professors were placed in important 
stations by the ecclesiastical authorities soon after the 
doctrine of the motion of tho earth had been declared by 
the same authorities contrary to scripture and in the 
same spirit is the process of demanding from galileo a 
public and official recantation of opinions which he had 
repeatedly been told by his ecclesiastical superiors he 
might hold as much as he pleased i think it is easy to 
believe that among persons so little careful to reconcile 
public profession with private conviction official decorum 
was all that was demanded when galileo had made his 
renunciation of the eartvs motion on his knees he rose 
and said as we are told e pur si mtiove — and yet it does 
move this is sometimes represented as the heroic soli 
loquy of a mind cherishing its conviction of the truth in 
spite of persecution i think we may more naturally con 
ceive it uttered as a playful epigram in the ear of a car

besides the ideas involved in the material sciences 
of which we have already examined the principal ones 
there is one idea or conception which our sciences do 
not indeed include but to which they not obscurely point 
and the importance of this idea will make it proper to 
speak of it though this must be done very briefly 



chapter v 
of the conception op a first cause 

 at the end of the last chapter but one we were led 
to this result — that we cannot in any of the palcetiolo 
gical sciences ascend to a beginning which is of the same 
nature as the existing cause of events and which depends 
upon causes that are still in operation philosophers 
never have demonstrated and probably never will be able 
to demonstrate what was the original condition of the 
solar system of the earth of the vegetable and animal 
worlds of languages of arts on all these subjects the 
course of investigation followed backwards as far as our 
materials allow us to pursue it ends at last in an impe 
netrable gloom we strain our eyes in vain when we 
try by our natural faculties to discern an origin 

 yet speculative men have been constantly employed 
in attempts to arrive at that which thus seems to be 
placed out of their reach the origin of languages the 
origin of the present distribution of plants and animals 
the origin of the earth have been common subjects of 
diligent and persevering inquiry indeed inquiries re 
specting such subjects have been at least till lately the

reasoning as well as by the aid of revelation the origin 
of the present course of things appears to be unconquer

human race cannot desist from perpetually asking and 
no failure in obtaining a satisfactory answer can prevent

to this we wflj that in doing what they have thus 
don in seeking what they have sought men are impelled 
by an intelleotual necessity liey cannot conceive a 
series of connected occurrences without a commence 
ment they cannot help supposing a cause for the whole 
as well as a cause for each part they cannot be satisfied 
with a succession of causes without assuming a first 
cause such an assumption is necessarily impressed 
upon our minds by our contemplation of a series of causes 
and effects that there must he a firh cause is accepted 
by all intelligent reasoners as an axiom and like othei 
axioms its truth is necessarily implied in the idea which 
it involves 

 q evidence of this axiom may be illustrated in 
several ways in the first place the axiom is assumed 
in the argument usually o£eered to prove the existence of 
the deity since it is said the world now exists andt 
since nothing cannot produce something aomethipg must 
have existed from eternity iliis something is the first 
cause it is god 

now what i have to remark here is this the con 
clusiveness of this argumit as a proof of the existence 
of one independent immutable deity depends entirely 
upon the assumption of the axiom above stated the 
world a series of causes and effect exists therefor 
there mnst be not only this series of causes and effects 
but also a first cause it will be easily seen that witb 
out the axiom that in every series of causes and effects 
there must be a first cause the reasonii is altogether 
inconclusive 

 or to put the matter otherwise the argument 
for the existence of the deity was stated thus miethiii§

exists therefore something must have existed from eter 
nity granted the opponent might say but this some 
thing which has existed from eternity why may it not be 
this very series of causes and effects which is now going 
on and which appears to contain in itself no indication 
of beginning or end and thus without the assumption 
of the necessity of a first cause the force of the argu 
ment may be resisted 

 but it may be asked how do those who have 
written to prove the existence of the deity reply to 
such an objection as the one just stated it is natural 
to suppose that on a subject so interesting and so long 
discussed all the obvious arguments with their replies 
have been fully brought into view what is the result 
in this case 

the principal modes of replying to the above objec 
tion that the series of causes and effects which now 
exists may have existed from eternity appear to be these 

in the first place our minds cannot be satisfied with 
a series of successive dependent causes and effects 
without something first and independent we pass from 
effect to cause and from that to a higher cause in search 
of something on which the mind can rest but if we can 
do nothing but repeat this process there is no use in it 
we move our limbs but make no advance our ques 
tion is not answered but evaded the mind cannot 
acquiesce in the destiny thus presented to it of being 
referred from event to event from object to object along 
an interminable vista of causation and time now this 
mode of stating the reply — to say that the mind ccmnot 
thm be satisfied appears to be equivalent to sapng that 
the mind is conscious of a principle in virtue of which 
such a view as this must be rejected — the mind takes 
refuge in the assumption of a first cause from an 
employment inconsistent with its own nature

relation of tradition to paltiology 

 or again we may avoid the objection by putting 
the argument for the existence of a deity in this form 
the series of causes and effects which we call the worlds 
or the cotse of nature may be considered as a whole 
and this whole must have a cause of its existence the 
whole collection of objects and events may be compre 
hended as a single effect and of this effect there must be 
a cause this cause of the universe must be superior 
to and independent of the special events which happen 
ing in time make up the universe of which he is the 
cause he must exist and exercise causation before 
theise events can begin he must be the first cause 

although the argument is here somewhat modified 
in form the substance is the same as before for the 
assumption that we may consider the whole series of 
causes and effects as a single effect is equivalent to the 
assumption that besides partial causes we must have a 
first cause and thus the idea of a first cause and 
the axiom which asserts its necessity are recognised in 
the usual argumentation on this subject 

 this idea of a first cause and the principle 
involved in the idea have been the subject of discussion 
in another manner as we have already said we assume 
as an axiom that afirst cause must exist and we assert 
that god the first cause exists eternal and immutable 
by the necessity which the axiom implies hence god 
is said to exist necessarily — to be a necessarily existing 
being and when this necessary eadstence of god had 
been spoken of it soon began to be contemplated as a 
sufficient reason and as an absolute demonstration of his 
existence without any need of referring to the world as 
an effect in order to arrive at god as the cause and 
thus men conceived that they had obtained a proof of 
the existence of the deity a priori from ideas as well 
as a posteriori from effects

 thus thomas aquinas employs this reasoning to 
prove the eternity of god oportet ponere aliquod 
primum necessarium quod est per se ipsum neoessarium 
et hoc est deus oum sit prima oausa ut dictum est igitur 
deus sbtemus est cum omue necessarium per se sit seter 
num it is true that the schoolmen never professed to 
b able to prove the eanstence of the deity a priori but 
they made use of this conception of necessary existence 
in a manner which approached very near to such an 
attempt thus snares f discusses the question utrum 
aliquo mode possit a priori demonstrari deum esse 
and resolves the question in this manner ad hune 
ergo medum dicendum eat demonstrate a posteriori 
deum esse ens necessarium et a se ex hoc attributd 
posse a priori demonstrari prater illud non posse esse 
aliud ens necessarium et a se et consequenter demon 
strari deum esse 

but in modem times attempts were made by des 
cartes and samuel clarke to prove the divine exist 
ence at once a priori arom the conception of necessary 
existence which it was argued could not subsist with 
out actual existence this argumentation was acutely 
and severely criticized by dr waterland 

 without dwelling upon a sulect the discussion of 
which does not enter into the design of the present work 
i may remark that the question whether an a priori proit 
of the existence of a first cause be possible is a ques 
tion concerning the nature of our ideas and the evidence 
of the axioms which they involve of the same kind as 
many questions which we have already bad to discuss 
is our conception or idea of a first cause gathered from 
the effects we see around us it is plain that we must 
answer here as in other cases that the idea is not

wtraoted from the phenomena but assumed in order that 
tb phenomena may become intelligible to the mind — 
that the idea is a necessary one inasmuch as it does not 
depend upon observation for its evidence but that it 
depends upon observation for its developments since with 
out some observation we cannot conceive the mind to bo 
cognisant of the relation of causation at all in this 
respect however the idea of a first cause is no less 
necessary than the ideas of space or time or cause in 
general and whether we call the reasoning derived 
from such a necessity an argument h priori or aposteriorif 
in either case it possesses the genuine character of demon 
stration being founded upon adorns which command 
universal assent 

 i have however spoken of our conception rather 
than of our idea of a first cause for the notion of a 
first cause appears to be rather a modification of the 
fundamental idea of cause which was formerly discussed 
than a separate and peculiar idea and the axiom that 
there mtist be a first cause is recognised by most persons 
as an application of the general axiom of causation that 
every effect must have a came this latter axiom being 
applied to the world considered in its totality as a single 
effect this distinction however between an idea and 
a conception is of no material consequence to our argu 
ment provided we allow the maxim that there must 
be a first cause to be necessarily and evidently true 
whether it be thought better to speak of it as an inde 
pendent axionj or to consider it as derived from the 
general axiom of causation 

 thus we necessarily infer a first cause although 
the palstiological sciences only point towards it and do 
not lead us to it but i must observe further that in 
each of the series of events which form the subject of 
palaetiological research the first cause is the same

without here resting upon reasoning founded upon our 
conception of a first cause i may remark that this 
identity is proved by the close connexion of all the 
branches of natural science and the way in which the 
causes and the events of each are interwoven with those 
which belong to the others we must needs believe 
that the first cause which produced the earth and its 
atmosphere is also the cause of the plants which clothe 
its surface that the first cause of the vegetable and of 
the animal world are the same that the first cause 
which produced light produced also eyes that the first 
cause which produced air and organs of articulation pro 
duced also language and the faculties by which language 
is rendered possible and if those faculties then also all 
mans other faculties — the powers by which as we have 
said he discerns right and wrong and recognizes a pro 
vidential as well as a natural course of things nor can 
we think otherwise than that the being who gave these 
faculties bestowed them for some puipose — bestowed 
them for that purpose which alone is compatible with 
their nature — the purpose namely of guiding and ele 
vating man in his present career and of preparing him 
for another state of being to which they irresistibly direct 
his hopes and thus although as we have said no one 
of the palaetiological sciences can be traced continuously 
to an origin yet they not only each point to an origin 
but all to the same origin their lines are broken indeed 
as they run backwards into the early periods of the world 
but yet they all appear to converge to the same invisible 
point and this point thus indicated by the natural 
course of things can be no other than that which is 
disclosed to us as the starting point of the providential 
course of the world for we are persuaded by such reasons 
as have just been hinted that the creator of the natural 
world can be no other than the author and governor 
and judge of the moral and spiritual world

kelation of tradition to palietiology 

 thus we are led by our material sciences and 
especially by the palaetiological class of them to the 
borders of a higher region and to a point of view from 
which we have a prospect of other provinces of know 
ledge in which other faculties of man are concerned 
besides his intellectual other interests involved besides 
those of speculation on these it does not belong to our 
present plan to dwell but even such a brief glance as 
we have taken of the connexion of material with moral 
speculations may not be useless since it may serve to 
show that the principles of truth which we are now labo 
riously collecting among the results of the physical sci 
ences may possibly find some application in those parts 
of knowledge towards which men most naturally look 
with deeper interest and more serious reverence 



we have been employed up to the present stage 
of this work in examining the materials of knowledge 
namely facts and ideas and we have dwelt particularly 
upon the latter element inasmuch as the consideration 
of it is on various accounts and especially at the present 
time by far the most important we have now to pro 
ceed to the remainder of our task — to determine the 
processes by which those materials may actually be made 
to constitute knowledge we have surveyed the stones 
of our building we have found them exactly squared 
and often curiously covered with significant imagery and 
important inscriptions we have now to discover how 
they may best be fitted into their places and cemented 
together so that rising stage above stage they may grow 
at last into that lair and lofty temple of truth for which 
we cannot doubt that they were intended by the great 
architect

of the construction of science 



chapter i 

of two principal processes by which 
science is constructed 

to the subject of the present book all that has pre 
ceded is subordinate and preparatory the first part of 
this work treated of ideas we now enter upon the 
second part in which we have to consider the know 
ledge which arises from them it has already been stated 
that knowledge requires us to possess both facts and 
ideas — that every step in our knowledge consists in 
applying the ideas and conceptions furnished by our 
minds to the facts which observation and experiment 
offer to us when our conceptions are clear and distinct 
when our fects are certain and sufficiently numerous and 
when the conceptions being suited to the nature of the 
facts are applied to them so as to produce an exact and 
universal accordance we attain knowledge of a precise 
and comprehensive kind which we may term science 
and we apply this term to our knowledge still more 
decidedly when facts being thus included in exact and 
general propositions such propositions are in the same 
manner included with equal rigour in propositions of a 
higher degree of generality and these again in otheis of 
a still wider nature so as to form a large and systematic 
whole

 construction of science 

but after thus stating in a general way the nature of 
science and the elements of which it consists we have 
been examining with a more close and extensive scrutiny 
some of those elements and we must now return to our 
main subject and apply to it the results of our long 
investigation we have been exploring the realm of 
ideas we have been passing in review the difficulties 
in which the workings of our own minds involve us 
when we would make our conceptions consistent with 
themselves and we have endeavoured to get a sight of 
the true solutions of these difficulties we have now to 
inquire how the results of these long and laborious effirt 
of thought find their due place in the formation of our 
knowledge what do we gain by these attempts to 
make our notions distinct and consistent and in what 
manner is the gain of which we thus become possessed 
canied to the general treasurehouse of our permanent 
and indestructible knowledge after all this battling 
in the world of ideas all this struggling with the shadowy 
and changing forms of intellectual perplexity how do wc 
secure to ourselves the fruits of our warfare and assure 
ourselves that we have really pushed forwards the fron 
tier of the empire of science it is by such an appro 
priation that the task which we have had in our bands 
during the last nine books of this work must acquire its 
real value and true place in our design 

in order to do this we must reconsider in a more 
definite and precise shape the doctrine which has already 
been laid down — that our knomledge consists in apply 
ing ideas to facts and that the conditions of real know 
ledge are that the ideas be distinct and appropriate and 
exactly applied to clear and certain facts the steps by 
which our knowledge is advanced are those by which 
one or the other of these two processes is rendered more 
complete — by which coficeptiom are made more clear in

two processes by which science is constructed 

themselves or by which the conceptions more strictly 
bind together the facts these two processes may be con 
sidered as together constituting the whole formation of 
our knowledge and the principles which have been esta 
blished in the preceding books bear principally upon the 
former of these two operations — upon the business of 
elevating our conceptions to the highest possible point of 
precision and generality but these two portions of the 
progress of knowledge are so clearly connected with 
each other that we shall consider them in immediate 
succession and having now to consider these operations 
in a more exact and formal manner than it was before 
possible to do we shall designate them by certain con 
stant and technical phrases we shall speak of the two 
processes by which we arrive at science as the ewpucation 
of conceptions and the couigation of facts we shall 
show how the discussions in which we have been engaged 
have been necessary in order to promote the former of 
these offices and we shall endeavour to point out modes 
maxims and principles by which the second of the two 
tasks may also be furthered 



chapter ii 

of the explication of conceptions 

 we have given the appellation of ideas to certain 
comprehensive forms of thought — as spaccy number catiscy 
composition resemblance — which we apply to the plieno 
mena which we contemplate but the special modifica 
tions of these ideas which are exemplified in particular 
fects we hiave termed conceptions as a circle a square 
fiumby an accelerating force a netural combination of ele 
ments a genm such conceptions involve in themselves

 construction of science 

certaiu necessary and universal relations derived from the 
ideas just enumerated and these relations are an indis 
pensable portion of the texture of our knowledge but 
to determine the contents and limits of this portion of 
our knowledge requires an examination of the ideas and 
conceptions from which it proceeds the conceptions 
must be as it were carefully unfolded so as to bring 
into clear view the elements of truth with which they are 
marked from their ideal origin this is one of the pro 
cesses by which our knowledge is extended and made 
more exact and this i shall describe as the explication 
of conceptions 

in the preceding books we have discussed a great 
many of the fundamental ideas of the most important 
existing sciences we have in those books abundant 
exemplifications of the process now under our considera 
tion we shall here add a few general remarks sug 
gested by the survey which we have thus made 

 i such discussions as those in which we have been 
engaged concerning our fundamental ideas have been the 
course by which historically speaking those conceptions 
which the existing sciences involve have been rendered 
so clear as to be fit elements of exact knowledge the 
disputes concerning the various kinds and measures of 
force were an important part of the progress of the sci 
ence of mechanics the struggles by which philosophers 
attained a right general conception of plane of circular 
of elliptical polarization were some of the most difficult 
steps in the modern discoveries of optics a conception 
of the atomic constitution of bodies such as shall include 
what we know and assume nothing more is even now a 
matter of conflict among chemists the debates by which 
in recent times the conceptions of species and genera 
have been rendered more exact have improved the science 
of botany the imperfection of the science of mineralogy

explication of conceptions 

arises in a great measure from the circumstance that in 
that subject the conception of a species is not yet fixed 
in physiology what a vast advance would that philoso 
pher make who should establish a precise tenable and 
consistent conception of life 

thus discussions and speculations concerning the im 
port of very abstract and general terms and notions may 
be and in reality have been far from useless and barren 
such discussions arose from the desire of men to impress 
their opinions on others but they had the effect of making 
the opinions much more clear and distinct in trying to 
make others understand them they learnt to understand 
themselves their speculations were begun in twilight 
and ended in the full brilliance of day it was not easily 
and at once without expenditure of labour or time that 
men arrived at those notions which now form the ele 
ments of our knowledge on the contrary we have in 
the history of science seen how hard discoverers and the 
forerunners of discoverers have had to struggle with the 
indistinctness and obscurity of the intellect before they 
could advance to the critical point at which truth became 
clearly visible and so long as in this advance some 
speculators were more forward than others there was a 
natural and inevitable ground of difference of opinion of 
argumentation of wrangling but the tendency of all 
such controversy is to diffuse truth and to dispel error 
truth is consistent and can bear the tug of war error is 
incoherent and falls to pieces in the struggle true con 
ceptions can endure the sun and become clearer as a 
fuller light is obtained confused and inconsistent notions 
vanish like visionary spectres at the break of a brighter 
day and thus all the controversies concerning such 
conceptions as science involves have ever ended in the 
establishment of the side on which the truth was found 

 indeed so complete has been the victory of truth

in most of these instances that at present we can hardly 
imagine the struggle to have been neeessary th very 
essence of these triumphs is that they lead ua to regard 
the views we reject as not only false but inconceivable 
and hence we are led rather to look back upon th van 
quished with contempt than upon the victon with grati 
tude we now despise those who in the gopemican 
controversy could not conceive the apparent motion of 
the sun on the heliocentric hypothesis or those who in 
opposition to galileo thought that a uniform force might 
be that which generated a velocity proportional to the 
space or those who held there was something absurd 
in newtons doctrine of the different refrangibility of 
differently coloured rays or those who imagined that 
when elements combine their sensible qualities must be 
manifest in the compound or those who were reluctant 
to give up the distinction of vegetables into herbs shrubs 
and trees we cannot help thinking that men must 
have been singularly dull of comprehension to find a 
difficulty in admitting what is to us so plain and simple 
we have a latent persuasion that we in their place should 
have bpen wiser and more clearsighted i — that we should 
have taken the right side and given our assent at onci 
to the truth 

 yet in reality such a persuaaion is a mere delusion 
the persons who in such instances as the above were 
on the losing side were very far in most cases from 
being persons more prejudiced or stupid or narrow 
minded than the greater part of mankind now are 
and the cause for which they fought was far from being 
a manifestly bad one till it had been so decided by the 
result of the war it is the peculiar character of scien 
tific contests that what is only an epigram with regard 
to other warfare is a truth in this and they who are 
defeated are really in the wrong but they may never

thde be men of great subtilt j sagacity and genius 
and we nourish a very foolish selfeomplaeenoy when we 
suppose that we are their superiank that this is so is 
proved by reeoueeting that many of those who have made 
very great discoveries have laboured under the imper 
fection of thought which was the obstacle to the next 
step in knowledge though kepler detected with great 
aouteness the numerieal laws of the solar system he 
laboured in vain to conceive the very simplest of the laws 
of motion by which the paths of the planets are governed 
though priestley made some important steps in chemistry 
he could not bring his mind to admit the doctrine of a 
general principle of oxidation how many ingenious 
men in the last century rejected the newtonian attrac 
tion as an impossible chimera how many more equally 
intelligent have in the same manner in our own time 
rected i do not now mean as false but as inconceivable 
the doctrine of luminiferous undulations to err in this 
way is the lot not only of men in general but of men of 
great endowments and very sincere love of truth 

 and those who liberate themselves from such per 
plexities and who thus go on in advance of their age in 
such matters owe their superiority in no small degree to 
such discussions and controversies as those to which we 
now refer in such controversies the conceptions in 
question are turned in all directions examined on all 
sides the strength and the weakness of the maxims 
which men apply to them are fiilly tested the light of 
the brightest minds is diffiised to others inconsistency 
is unfolded into selfcontradiction axioms are built up 
into a system of necessaiy truths and ready exemplifi

to that of lagrange is perhaps the best exempufieatioa 
of the mode in which the progress of a science depends 
upon such disputes and speculations as give clearness and 
generality to its elementary conceptions this it is to 
be recollected is the kind of progress of which we are 
now speaking and this is the principal feature in the 
portion of scientific history which we have mentioned 
for almost all that was to be done by reference to obser 
vation was executed by €ralileo and his disciples what 
remained was the task of generalization and simplifica 
tion and this was promoted in no small degree by the 
various controversies which took place within that period 
concerning mechanical conceptions — as for example 
the question concerning the measure of the force of per 
cussion — the war of the vis vwa — the controversy of 
the centre of oscillation — of the independence of statics 
and dynamics — of the principle of least action — of tine 
evidence of the laws of motion — and of the number of 
laws really distinct none of these discussions was witln 
out its influence in giving generality and clearness to the 
mechanical ideas of mathematicians and therefore though 
remote from general apprehension and dealing with very 
abstract notions they were of eminent use in the perfect 
ing the science of mechanics similar controversies con 
cerning fundamental notions those for example which 
galileo himself had to maintain were no less useful in 
the formation of the science of hydrostatics and the 
like struggles and conflicts whether they take the form 
of controversies between several persons or only operate 
in the efforts and fluctuations of the discoverers mind 
are always requisite before the conceptions acquire that 
clearness which makes them fit to appear in the enuncia 
tion of scientific truth 

this then is one object of the preceding books — to 
bring under the readers notice the main elements of the 



digitized by vjooq ic 



explication of conceptions 

controversies which have thus had so important a share 
in the formation of the existing body of science and the 
decisions on the controverted points to which the mature 
examination of the subject has led and thus to give 
an abundant exhibition of that step which we term the 
explication of conceptions 

 ii the result of such controversies as we have 
been speaking of often appears to be summed up in a 
definition and the controversy itself has often assumed 
the form of a battle of definitions for example the 
inquiry concerning the laws of felling bodies led to the 
question whether the proper definition of a uniform force 
is that it generates a velocity proportional to the space 
from rest or to the time the controversy of the vis viva 
was what was the proper definition of the measure of 
force a principal question in the classification of mine 
rals is what is the definition of a mineral species phy 
siologists have endeavoured to throw light on their sub 
ject by defining organizationy or some similar term 

 it is very important for us to observe that these 
cpntroversies have never been questions of insulated and 
avhibrarjf definitions as men seem often tempted to sup 
pose them to have been in all cases there is a tacit 
assumption of some proposition which is to be expressed 
by means of the definition and which gives it its import 
ance the dispute concerning the definition thus acquires 
a real value and becomes a question concerning true and 
false thus in the discussion of the question what is a 
uniform force it was taken for granted that gravity is a 
uniform force — in the debate of the vis viva it was 
assumed that in the mutual action of bodies the whole 
effect of the force is unchanged — in the zoological defi 
nition of species that it consists of individuals which 
have or may have sprung from the same parents it is 
presumed that individuals so related resemble each other 

vol n n

more than those which are excluded by such a definition 
or perhaps that species so defined have permanent and 
definite differences a definition of organization or of 
any other term which was not employed to express some 
principle would be of no value 

the establishment therefore of a right definition of 
a term may be a useful step in the explication of our 
conceptions but this will be the case then only when 
we have under our consideration some proposition in 
which the term is employed for then the question 
really is how the conception shall be understood and 
defined in order that the proposition may be true 

 the establishment of a proposition requires an 
attention to observed fiicts and can never be rightly 
derived from our conceptions alone we must hereafter 
consider the necessity which exists that the facts should 
be rightly bound together as well as that our conceptions 
should be clearly employed in order to lead us to real 
knowledge but we may observe here that in such 
oases at least as we are now considering the two pro 
cesses are coordinate to unfold our conceptions by the 
means of definitions has never been serviceable to science 
except when it has been associated with an immediate use 
of the definitions the endeavour to define a uniform 
force was combined with the assertion that gravity is a 
uniform force the attempt to define accelerating force 
was immediately followed by the doctrine that accelera 
ting forces may be compounded the process of defining 
momentum was comiected with the principle that mo 
menta gained and lost are equal naturalists would have 
given in vain the definition of species which we have 
quoted if they had not also given the characters of 
species so separated definition and proposition are the 
two handles of the instrument by which we apprehend 
truth the former is of no use without the latter defi

nition may be the beat mode of explainidg our conception 
but that whicli alone makes it wortli nrhile to explain it 
in any mode is the opportunity of using it in the expres 
sion of truth when a definition is propounded to us m 
a useful step in knowledge we are always entitled to ask 
what principle it serres to enunciate if there be no 
answer to this inquiry we define and giye clearness to our 
qonoeptions in tain while we labour at such a task we 
do but light up a vacant room we sharpen a knife with 
which we have nothing to cut we take exact aim while 
we load our artillery with blank cartridge we apply strict 
rules of grammar to sentences which have no meaning 

if on the other hand we have under our considera 
tion a proposition probably established every step which 
we can make in giving distinctness and exactness to the 
terms which this proposition involves is an important 
step towards scientific truth in such cases any improve 
ment in our definition is a real advance in the explication 
of our conception the clearness of our expressions oasts 
a light upon the ideas which we contemplate and convey 
to others 

d iii but though defrnition may be subservient 
to a right explication of our conceptions it is not essential 
to that process it is absolutely necessary to every 
advance in our knowledge that those by whom such 
advances are made should possess clearly the conceptions 
which they employ but it is by no means neoessaiy 
that they should unfold these conceptions in the words 
of a formal definition it is easily seen by examining 
the course of galileos discoveries that he had a distinct 
conception of the mofoing force which urges bodies down 
wards upon an inclined plane while he still hesitated 
wheuier to call it momentum energy impetus or 
force and did not venture to ofkat a definition of the

ception of pdarizalion was clear ia the miads of many 
optical speculators from the time of huyghens and 
newton to that of young and fresnel this conception 
we have defined to be opposite properties depending 
upon opposite positions but this notion was bj the 
discoverers though constantly assumed and expressed by 
means of superfluous hypotheses never clothed in definite 
language and in the mean time it was the custom 
among subordinate writers on the same subjects to say 
that the term polarization had no definite meaning and 
was merely an expression of our ignorance the defini 
tion which was offered by haiiy and others of a ndneror 
logical jjpoic — the same elements combined in the 
same proportions with the same fundamental form 
was false inasmuch as it was incapable of being rigor 
ously applied to any one case but this defect did not 
prevent the philosophers who propounderl such a defini 
tion from making many valuable additions to mineralo 
gical knowledge in the way of identifying some species 
and distinguishing others the right conception which 
they possessed in their minds prevented their being 
misled by their own very erroneous definition the want 
of any precise definitions of strata and formations and 
epochs among geologists has not prevented the discus 
sions which they have carried on upon such sulgects from 
being highly serviceable in the promotion of geological 
knowledge for however much the apparent vagueness 
of these terms might leave their arguments open to cavil 
there was a general understanding prevalent amog the 
most intelligent cultivators of the science as to what was 
meant in such expressions and this common underetand 
ing sufficed to determine what evidence should be consi 
dered conclusive and what inconclusive in these inquiries 
and ths the distinctness of conception which is a reel 
requisite of scientific progress existed in the minds of the

inquirers although definitions vhich are a partial and 
accidental evidence of this distinctness had not yet been 
hit upon tlie idea had been developed in niens minds 
although a clothing of words had not been contrived for 
it nor perhaps the necessity of such a vehicle felt 
and thus that essential condition of the progress of know 
ledge of which we are here speaking existed while it 
was left to the succeeding speculators to put this unwritten 
rule in the form of a verbal statute 

 iv men are often prone to consider it as a 
thoughtless omission of an essential circumstance and as 
a neglect which involves some blame when knowledge 
thus assumes a form in which definitions or rather con 
ceptions are implied but are not expressed but in such 
a judgment they assume that to be a matter of choice 
requiring attention only which is in fact as difficult and 
precarious as any other portion of the task of discovery 
to define so that our definition shall have any scientific 
value requires no small portion of that sagacity by which 
truth is detected as we have already said definitions 
and propositions are coordinate in their use and in their 
origin in many cases perhaps in most the proposition 
which cotitains a scientific truth is apprehended with 
confidence but with some vagueness and vacillation 
before it is put in a positive distinct and definite form 
it is thus known to be true before it can be enunciated 
in terms each of which is rigorously defined the busi 
ness of definition is part of the business of discovery 
when it has been clearly seen what ought to be our 
definition it must be pretty well knowh what truth we 
have to state the definition as well as the discovery 
rapposes a decided step in our knowledge to have been

tlie philosophy derived from the history confirm their 
speculative views if the explication of our conceptions 
ever assume the form of a definition it will not be as an 
arbitrary process or as a matter of course but as hie 
mark of one of those happy efforts of sagacity to which 
all the successive advances of our knowledge are owing 

 v our conceptions then even when they be 
come so clear as the progress of knowledge requires are 
not adequately expressed or necessarily expressed at all 
by means of definitions we may ask then whether there 
is any other mode of expression in which we may look for 
the evidence and exposition of that peculiar exactness 
of thought which the formation of science demands 
and in answer to this inquiry we may refer to the pre 
vious discussions respecting many of the fundamental 
ideas of the sciences it has there been seen that these 
ideas involve many elementary truths which enter into 
the texture of our knowledge introducing into it con 
nexions and relations of the most important kind although 
these elementary truths catinot be deduced from any 
verbal definition of the idea it has been seen that these 
elementary truths may often be enunciated by means of 
ajnomsf stated in addition to or in preference to definl 
tions for example the idea of cause which forms the 
lasis of the science of mechanics makes its appearance 
in our elementary mechanical reasonings not as a defini 
tion but by means of the axioms that causes are measured 
by their effects and that reaction is equal and opposite to 
action such axioms tacitly assumed or occasionally 
stated as maxims of acknowledged validity belong to all 
the ideas which form the foundations of the sciences and 
are constantly employed in the reasoning and speculations 
ef those who think clearly on such subjects it may 
often be a task of some difficulty to detect and enunciate 
in wordfl the principles which are thus perhaps silently

and unconsciouly taken for granted by those who have a 
share in the establishment of scientific truth but inas 
much as these principles are an essential element in our 
knowledge it is very important to our present purpose to 
separate them from the associated materials and to trace 
them to their origin this accordingly have attempted 
to do with regard to a considerable number of the most 
prominent oi such ideas in the preceding books the 
reader will there find many of these ideas resolved into 
axioms mid principles by means of which their effect 
upon the elementary reasonings of the various sciences 
may be expressed that part of the work is intended to 
form in some measure a representation of the ideal side 
of our physical knowledge — a table of those contents of 
our conceptions which are not received directly from fttcts 
—an exhibition of rules to which we know that truth 
must conform 

 in order however that we may see the necessary 
cogency of these rules we must possess clearly and 
steadily the ideas from which the rules how in order 
to perceive the necessary relations of the circles of the 
sphere we must possess clearly the idea of solid space 
i— in order that we may see the demonstration of the 
composition of forces we must have the idea of cause 
moulded into a distinct conception of statical force this 
is that clearness qf ideas which we stipulate for in any 
ones mind as the first essential condition of his making 
any new step in the discovery of truth and we now see 
what answer we are able to give if we are asked for a 
criterion of this clearness of idea the criterion is that 
the person shall see the necessity of the axioms belongs 
ing to each idea — shall accept them in such a manner as 
to perceive the cogency of the reasonings founded upon 
them thus a person has a clear idea of space who 
follows the reasonings of geometry and fully apprehends

their conclusiveuess the explication of conceptiki 
which we are speaking of as an essential part of real 
knowledge is the process by which we bring the cleainess 
of our ideas to bear upon the formation of our knowledge 
and this is done as we have now seen not always nor 
generally nor principally by laying down a definition of 
the conception but by acquiring such a possession of it 
in our minds as enables indeed compels us to admit 
along with the conception all the axioms and principles 
which it necessltrily implies and by which it produces its 
effect upon our reasonings 

 vi but in order that we may make any real 
advance in the discovery of truth our ideas must not 
only be clear they must also be apprpriate each 
science has for its basis a different class of ideas and the 
steps which constitute the progress of one science can 
never be made by employing the ideas of anoth kind of 
science no genuine advance could ever be obtained in 
mechanics by applying to the subject the ideas of space 
nd time merely — no advance in chemistry by the use of 
inere mechanical conceptions — no discovery in physiology 
by referring facts to mere chemical and mechanical prin 
ciples mechanics must involve the conception of force 
—chemistry the conception of elementary composition 
— physiology the conception of vital powers each 
science must advance by means of its appropriate concep 
tions each has its own field which extends as for as its 
principles can be applied i have already noted the 
separation of several of these fields by the divisions of the 
preceding books the mechanical the secondary me 
chanical the chemical the classificatory the biological 
sciences form so many great provinces in the kingdom of

peculiar fundamental principles every attempt to build

belodg to fin old one will lead to frivolous and barren 
speculations 

this truth has been exemplified in all the instances in 
which subtle speculative men have failed in their attempts 
to frame new sciences and especially in the essays of the 
andent schools of philosophy in greece as has already 
been stated in the history of science aristotle and 
his followers endeavoured in vain to account for the 
hiechanical relation of forces in the lever by applying th 
inappropriate geometrical conceptions of the properties of 
the circle — they failed in explaining the form of the 
luminous spot made by the sun shining through a hole 
because they applied the inappropriate conception of a 
drcular quality in the suns light — they speculated to no 
purpose about the elementary composition of bodies 
because they assumed the inappropriate conception of 
likeness between the elements and the compound instead 
of the genuine notion of elements merely determining the 
qualities of the compound and in like manner in 
modem times we have seen in the history of the ftmda 
mental ideas of the physiological sciences how all the 
inappropriate mechanical and chemical and other ideas 
which were applied in succession to the subject failed in 
bringg into view any genuine physiological truth 

 that the real cause of the failure in the instances 
above mentioned lay in the conceptions is plain it was 
not ignorance of the facts which in these cases prevented 
the discovery of the truth aristotle was as well ac 
quainted with the fact of the proportion of the weights 
which balance on a lever as archimedes was although 
archimedes alone gave the true mechanical reason for 
the proportion aristotle knew that the rays of light are 
straight lines although he was not a sufficiently just 
thinker to apply the conception of rays in explaining the

round imftge which the sun produces by shining through 
a triangular hole 

with regard to the doctrine of the four elements 
indeed the inapplicability of the conception of composi 
tion of qualities required perhaps to be proved by some 
reference to facts but this conception was devised at 
first and accepted by succeeding times in a blind and 
gratuitous manner which could hardly have happened if 
men had been awake to the necessary condition of our 
knowledge — that the conceptions which we introduce 
into our doctrines are not arbitrary or accidental notions 
but certain peculiar modes of apprehension strictly deter 
mined by the subject of our speculations 

 vii it may however be said that this injunc 
tion that we pe to employ appropriate conceptions only 
in the formation of our knowledge cannot be of practical 
use because we can only determine what ideas are appro 
priato by finding that they truly combine the facts and 
this is to a certain extent true scientific discovery 
must ever depend upon some happy thought of which we 
annot trace the origin some fortunate cast of intellect 
rising above all rules no maxims can be given which 
inevitably lead to discovery no precepts will elevate t 
man of ordinary endowments to the level of a man of 
genius nor will an inquirer of truly inventive mind need 
to come to the teachef of inductive philosophy to learn 
how to exercise the faculties which nature has given bim

p thinks that aristotle committed this error because he did not 
try the experiment under various forms yet he cannot but allow 
that the result follows by mere geometrical reasoning without any

their powers of discotering truth little augment by ftny 
injunctions respecting distinct and appropriate ideas 
and such men may very naturally question the utility of 
rules altogether 

 but yet the opinions which such persons may 
entertain will not lead us to doubt concerning the value 
of the attempts to analyse and methodize the process of 
discovery who would attend to kepler if he had main 
tained that the speculations of francis bacon were 
worthless notwithstanding what has been said we 
may venture to assert that the maxim which points out 
the necessity of ideas appropriate as well as clear for 
the purpose of discovering truth is not without its use 
it may at least have a value as a caution or prohibition 
and may thus turn us away from labours certain to be 
fruitless we have already seen that this maxim if duly 
attended to would have at once condemned as wrongly 
directed the speculations of physiologists of the mathema 
tical mechanical chemical and vitalfluid schools since 
the ideas which the teachers of these schools introduce 
cannot suffice for the purposes of physiology which seeks 
truths respecting the vital powers again it is clear 
from similar considerations that no definition of a mine 
ralogical species by chemical characters alone can answer 
the end of science since we seek to make mineralogy 
not an analytical but a classificatory science even 
before the appropriate conception is matured in menil 
minds so that they see clearly what it is they may still 
have light enough to see what it is not

history of science is that though for the most part as we 
shall see the progress of science consists in accumulating 
and combining facts rather than in debating concerning 
definitions there are still certain periods when the rfw 
cnssion of definitions may be the most useful mode of cul 
tivating some special branch of science this discussion 
is of course always to be conducted by the light of facts 
and as has already been said along with the settlement 
of every good definition will occur the corresponding 
establishment of some proposition but still at particular 
periods the want of a definition or of the clear concep 
tions which definition supposes may be peculiarly felt 
a good and tenable definition of species in mineralogy 
would at present be perhaps the most important step 
which the science could make a just conception of the 
nature of life and if expressed by means of a definition 
so much the better can hardly jfiail to give its possessor 
an immense advantage in the speculations which now 
come under the consideration of physiologists and con 
troversies respecting definitions in these cases and such 
as these may be very far from idle and unprofitable 

thus the knowledge that clear and appropriate ideas 
are requisite for discovery although it does not lead to 
any very precise precepts or supersede the value of 
natural sagacity and inventiveness may still be of use to 
us in our pursuit after truth it may show us what course 
of research is in each stage of science recommended by 
the general analogy of the history of knowledge and it 
may both save us from hopeless and barren paths of 
speculation and make us advance with more courage and 
confidence to know that we are looking for discoveries 
in the manner in which they have always hitherto been 
made

at present mention no scientific discovery can with 
anj justice be considered dtie to accident in whatever 
manjier facts may be presented to the notice of a dis 
coverer they can never become the materials of exact 
knowledge except they find his mind abeady provided 
with precise and suitable conceptions by which they may 
be analysed and connected indeed as we have already 
seen facts cannot be observed as facts except in virtue 
of the conceptions which the observer himself uncon 
sciously supplies and they are not facts of observation 
for any purpose of discovery except these familiar and 
unconscious acts of thought be themselves of a just and 
precise kind but supposing the ikcts to be adequately 
observed they can never be combined into any new truth 
except by means of some new conceptions clear and ap 
propriate such as i have endeavoured to characterize 
when the observer s mind is prepared with such instru 
ments a very few facts or it may be a single one may 
bring the process of discovery into action but in such 
cases this previous condition of the intellect and not the 
single fact is really the main and peculiar cause of the 
success the fact is merely the occasion by which the 
engine of discovery is brought into play sooner or later 
it is as i have elsewhere said only the spark which dis 
charges a gun already loaded and pointed and there is 
little propriety in speaking of such an accident as the 
cause why the bullet hits the mark if it were true that 
the fall of an apple was the occasion of newtons pursu 
ing the train of thought which led to the doctrine of 
universal gravitation the habits and constitution of new 
tons intellect and not the apple were the real source of 
this great event in the progress of knowledge the

own level may lead men to ascribe mch results to any 
casual circumstances which accompany them but no one 
who fririy considers the real nature of great discoveries 
and the intellectual proceasqs which they involve can 
seriously hold the opinion of their being the efibct of 
accident 

 such accidents never happen to oonmion men 
thousands of men even of the most inquiring and spe 
culative men had seen bodies fall but who except 
newton ever followed the accident to such consequences 
and in fact how little of his train of thought was con 
tained in or even directly suggested by the fall of the 
apple if the apple fall said the discoverer why should 
not the moon the planets the satellites fall but how 
much previous thought what a steady conception of the 
universality of the laws of motion gathered from other 
sources were requisite that the inquirer should see any 
connexion in these cases was it by accident that he 
saw in the apple an image of the moon and of every 
body in the solar system 

 the same observations may be made with regard 
to the other cases which are sometimes adduced as ex 
amples of accidental discovery it has been said by 
the accidental placing of a rhomb of calcareous spar upon 
a book or line bartholinus discovered the property of the 
double rrfractim of light but bartholinus could have 
seen no such consequence in the accident if he bad not 
previously had a clear conception of single rrfrachcm a 
lady in describing an optical experiment which had been 
shown her said of her teacher he told me to wcvea

that he only meant me to move my head up and down

tvithout design what huyghens really obserred was that 
the images appeared and disappeared alternately as he 
turned the rhombs round but was it an easy or an 
obvious business to analyse this curious alternation into 
the circumstances of the rays of light having sides as 
newton expressed it and into the additional hypotheses 
which are implied in the term polarization those will 
be able to answer this question who have found how far 
from easy it is to understand clearly what is meant by 
polarimtion in this case now that the property is fully 
established huyghenss success depended on his clear

most men however often they had accidentally com 
bined two rhombs in different positions by accideui 
tally looking through a prism of the same substance and 
turning it round mains discovered the polarization of 
light by reflection mains saw that in some positions 
the light reflected from the windows of the louvre thus 
seen through the prism became dim another man 
would have supposed this dimness the result of accident 
but his mind was differently constituted and disciplined 
he considered the position of the window and of the 
prism repeated the experiment over and over and in 
virtue of the eminently distinct conceptions of space which 
he possessed resolved the phenomena into its geometrical 
conditions a believer in accident would not have

who can say even in the heat of debate or the reckless

that the discoveries might have been made by the most

 i have now i trust shown in various ways how 
the ewflication of conceptions including in this term 
their clear development from fundamental ideas in the

the form of definitions or axioms when that can be 
done is an essential part in the establishment of all exact

of facts as the materials of science 

we have now to examine how science is built up 
by the combination of facts in doing this we suppose 
that we have already obtained a supply of definite and 
certain facts free from obscurity and doubt we must 
therefore first consider under what conditions facts can 
assume this character

of facts as thk materials of science 

when we inquire what facts are to be made the 
materials of science perhaps the answer which we should 
most commonly receive would be that they must be lrue 
fatj as distinguished from any mere inferences or opi 
nions of our own we should probably be told that we 
must be careful in such a case to consider as facts only 
what we really ojserve that we must assert only what 
we see and believe nothing except upon the testimony 
of our senses 

but such maxims are r from being easy to apply as 
a little examination will convince us 

 it has been explained in the preceding part of 
this work that all perception of external objects and 
occurrences involves an active as well as a passive pro 
cess of the mind — includes not only sisations but also 
ideas by which sensations are bound together and have a 
imity given to them from this it follows that there is 
a difficulty in separating in our perceptions what we 
receive from without and what we ourselves contribute 
from within — what we perceive and what we infer in 
many cases this difficulty is obvious to all as for 
example when we witness the performances of a juggler 
or a ventriloquist in these instances we imagine our 
elves to see and to hear what certainly we do not see 
and hear the performer takes advantage of the habits 
by which our minds supply interruptions and infer con 
nexions and by giving us fallacious indications he leads 
us to perceive as an actual fact what does not happen 
at all in these cases it is evident that we ourselves 
assist in making the fact for we make one which does 
not really exist in other cases though the fslct which 
we perceive be true we can easily see that a large por 
tion of the perception is our own act as when from the 
sight of a bird of prey we infer a carcass or when we

 construction of science 

read a halfobliterated inscription in the latter case 
the mind supplies the meaning and perhaps half the 
letters yet we do not hesitate to say that we aetaimy 
read the inscription thus in many cases our own 
inferences and interpretations enter into our fects but 
this happens in many instances in which it is at first 
sight less obvious when any one has seen an oaktree 
blown down by a strong gust of wind he does not think 
of the occurrence any otherwise than as a fiut of which 
b is assured by his senses yet by what sense does he 
perceive the force which he thus supposes the wind to 
exert by what sense does he distinguish an oaktree 
fhm all other trees it is clear upon reflection that in 
such a case his own mind supplies the conception of 
extraneous impulse and pressure by which he thus inter 
prets the motions observed and the distinction of dif 
ferent kinds of trees according to which he thus names 
the one under his notice the idea of force and the 
idea of definite resemblances and differences are thus 
combined with the impressions on our senses and form 
m undistinguished portion of that which we consider as 
the fact and it is evident that we can in no other way 
perceive force than by seeing motion and cannot give 
k name to any object without not only seeing a differ 
enee of single objects but supposing a difference of classes 
of olgects when we speak as if we saw impulse and 
attraction things and classes we really see only objects 
of various forms and colours more or less numerous 
variously combined but do we really perceive so much 
as this when we see the form the size the number 
the motion of objects are these really mere impressions 
on our senses unmodified by any contribution or ope 
ration of the mind itself a very little attention will 
suflsce to convince us that this is not the case when 
we see a windmill turning it may happen as we have

elsewhere noticed that we mistake the direction in 
which the sails turn when we look at certain diagrams 
they may appear either convex or concaye when we see 
the moon first in the horiron and afterwards high up in the 
sky we judge her to be much larger in the former than in 
the latter position although to the eye she subtends the 
same angle and in these oases and the like it has been 
seen that the error and cohfnsion which we thus incur 
arise from the mixture of acts of the mind itself with 
impressions on the senses but such acts are as wo 
have also seen inseparable portions of the process of per 
oeption a certain activity of the mind is involved not 
only in seeing objects erroneously but in seeing them 
at all with regard to solid objects this is generally 
acknowledged when we seem to see an edifice occu 
pying space in all dimensions we really see only a repre 
sentation of it as it appears referred by perspective to a 
surface the inference of the solid form is an operation 
of our own alike when we look at a reality and when we 
look at a picture but we may go further is plane 
figure really a mere sensation if we look at a decagon 
do we see at once that it has ten sides or is it not neces 
sary for us to count them and is not counting an act of 
the mind all objects are seen in space all otjects are 
seen as one or many but are not the idea of space and 
the idea of number requisite in order that we may thus 
apprehend what we see that these ideas of space and 
number involve a connexion derived from the mind and 
not from the senses appears as we have already seen 
from this that those ideas afford us the materials of uni 
tersdly and necessary truths such truths as the senses 
cannot possibly supply and thus even the perception 
of such facts as the size shape and number of olreets 
cannot be said to be impressions of sense distinct from

all acts of mind and cannot be expected to be free from 
error on the ground of their being mere observed facts 

thus the difficulty which we have been illustrating 
of distinguishing facts from inferences and from interpre 
tations of facts is not only great but amounts to an 
impossibility the separation at which we aimed in the 
outset of this discussion and which was supposed to be 
necessary in order to obtain a firm groundwork for 
science is found to be unattainable we cannot obtain 
a sure basis of facts by rejecting all inferences and judg 
ments of our own for such inferences and judgments 
form an unavoidable element in all facts we cannot 
exclude our ideas from our perceptions for our percep 
tions involve our ideas 

 but still it cannot be doubted that in selecting 
the facts which are to form the foundation of science we 
must reduce them to their most simple and certain form 
and must reject everything from which doubt or error 
may arise now since this it appears cannot be done 
by rejecting the ideas which all fiewts involve in what 
manneir are we to conform to the obvious maxim that the 
fseicts which form the basis of science must be perfectly 
definite and certain 

the analysis of facts into ideas and sensations which 
we have so often referred to suggests the answer to this 
inquiry we are not able nor need we endeavour to 
exclude ideas from our facts but we may be able to dis 
cem with perfect distinctness the ideas which we include 
we cannot observe any phenomena without applying to 
them such ideas as space and number cause and resem 
blance and usually several others but we may avoid 
applying these ideas in a wavering or obscure manner 
wid confounding ideas with one another we cannot read 
any of the inscriptions which nature presents to us with

it our business to acquaiut ourselves perfectly with the 
language which we thus employ and to interpret it 
according to the rigorous rules of grammar and analogy 

this maxim that when facts are employed as the 
basis of science we must distinguish clearly the ideas 
which they involve and must apply these in a distinct 
and rigorous manner will be found to be a more precise 
guide than we might perhaps at first expect we may 
notice one or two rules which flow from it 

 in the first place facts when used as the materials 
of physical science must be referred to conceptions of the 
intellect onlt all emotions of fear admiration and the 
like being rejected or subdued thus the observations of 
phenomena which are related as portents and prodigies 
striking terror and boding evil are of no value for pur 
poses of science the tales of armies seen warring in 
the sky the sound of arms heard from the clouds fiery 
dragons chariots swords seen in the air may refer to 
meteorological phenomena but the records of pheno 
mena observed in the state of mind which these descrip 
tions imply can be of no scientific value we cannot 
make the poets our observers 

annorum scmiiam toto germania ooelo 
audiit insolitis tfemuenmt motibus alpes 
yox quoque per lucos yulgo exaudita silentes 
iiigens et bimulacra modis pallentia miris 
visa sub obsoarom noctis pecndesqne locato 

the mixture of fancy and emotion with the observation 
of fecte has often disfigured them to an extent which 
is too familiar to all to need illustration we have an 
example of this result in the manner in which comets 
are described in the treatises of the middle ages in 
such works these bodies are regularly distributed into 
several classes accordingly as they assume the form of a

bword of a bpear of a cross and so on when sucli 
resemblances had become matters of interest the impress 
sions of the senses were governed not by the rigorous 
conceptions of form and colour but by these assimied 
images and under these circumstances we can attach 
little value to the statement of what was seen 

in all such phenomena the reference of the olects 
to the exact ideas of space number position motion and 
the like is the first step of science and accordingly this 
reference was made at an early period in those scienceii 
which made an early progress as for instance astronomy 
yet even in astronomy there appears to have been a 
period when the predominant conceptions of men in 
regarding the heavens and the stars pointed to mythical 
ory and supernatural influence rather than to mere 
relations of space time and motion and of this primeval 
condition of those who gazed at the stars we seem to 
have mnants in the constellations in the mythological 
names of the planets and in the early prevalence of astror 
logy it was only at a later period when men had begun 
to measure the places or at least to count the revolutions 
of the stars that astronomy had its birth 

 and thus we are led to another rule — that in 
collecting facts which are to be made the basis of science 
the facts are to be observed as far as possible toith refer 
ence to place figwre number motion and the like concep 
tions which depending upon the ideas of space and 
time are the most universal exact and simple of our con 
ceptions it was by early attention to these relations in 
the case of the heavenly bodies that the ancients formed 
the science of astronomy it was by not making precise 
observations of this kind in the case of terrestrial bodies 
that they foiled in framing a science of the mechanics of 
motion they succeeded in optics as for as they made 
observations of this nature but when they ceased to 



digitized by vjooq ic 



of facts as the mateials of cience 

trace the geometrical paths of rajg in the actual experi 
ment they ceased to go forwards in the knowledge of 
this subject 

 but we may state a further bule •— that though 
these relations of time and space are highly important in 
almost all facts we are not to confine ourvelyes to these 
hut are to consider the phenomena with reference to 
other concqtwns also it being always understood that 
these conceptions are to be made as exact and rigorous 
as those of geometry mid number thus the science of 
harmonics arose from considering sounds with reference 
to cofwordi and discords hie science of mechanics arose 
from hot only observing motions as they take place in 
time and space but further referring them to force as 
iheir cause and in like mann other sciences depend 
upon other ideas which as i have endeayoured to show 
hre not less fundamital than those of time and space 
and like them capable of leading to rigorous conse 
quences 

 thus the fbcts which we assume as the basis of 
meaoe are to be freed from all the mists which imagina 
tion and passion throw round them and to be separated 
into those elementary fieuts which exhibit simple and 
evident relations of time or space or cause or some 
other ideas equally clear we resolve the complex ap 
pearances which nature offers to us and the mixed and 
manifold modes of looking at these appearances which 
rise in our thoughts into limited definite and clearly 
understood portions this process we may term the 
decomposition of facts it is the beginning of exat 
knowledge — the first step in the formation of all science 
this decomposition of fiacts into elementary iacts clearly 
understood and surely ascertained must precede all dis 
covery of the laws of nature 

 but though this step is necessary it is not inuibly 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 construction op science 

sufficient it by no means follows that when we have 
thus decomposed facts into elementary truths of observa 
tion we shall soon be able to combine these so as to 
obtain truths of a higher and more speculative kind we 
have examples which show us how far this is from being 
a necessary consequence of the former step observa 
tions of the weather made and recorded for many years 
have not led to any general truths forming a science of 
meteorology and although great numerical precision hasl 
been given to such observations by means of barometers 
thermometers and other instruments still no general laws 
regulating the cycles of change of such phenomena have 
yet been discovered in like manner the fices of crys 
tals and the sides of the polygons which these crystals 
form were counted and thus numerical facts were ob 
tained perfectly true and definite but still of no value 
for purposes of science and when it was discovered 
what element of the form of crystals it was important to 
observe and measure namely the angle made by two 
faces with each other this discovery was a step of a higher 
order and did not belong to that department of mere 
exact observation of manifest facts with which we are 
here concerned 

 when the complex facts which nature offers to us 
are thus decomposed into simple facts the decomposition 
in general leads to the introduction of teftns and phrases 
more or less technical by which these simple fiwts are 
described thus when astronomy was thus made a science 
of measurement the things measured were soon described 
as hours and dats and cycles altitude and declination 
phases and aspects in the same manner in music the 
concords had names assigned them as diapente diatessaron 
diapason in studying optics the rays of light were 
spoken of as having their course altered by reflection and 
refraction and when useful observations began to be 



digitized by vjooq ic 



of facts as the matiswals of science 

made in mechanics the observers spoke oi force pressure 
momentum inertia and the like 

when we take phenomena in which the leading idea 
is resemblance and resolve them into precise component 
facts we obtain some kind of classification as for in 
stance when we lay down certain rules by which parti 
cular trees or particular animals are to be known this 
is the earliest form of natural history and the classifica 
tion which it involves is that which corresponds nearly 
or exactly with the usual names of the objects thus 
classified 

 thus the first attempts to render observation certain 
and exact lead to a decomposition of the obvious facts 
into elementary facts connected by the ideas of space 
time number cause likeness and others and into a classi 
fication of the simple facts more or less just and marked 
by names either common or technical elementary facts 
and individual objects thus observed and classified form 
the materials of science and any improvement in classi 
fication or nomenclature or any discovery of a connexion 
among the materials thus acciunulated leads us fairly 
within the precincts of science we must now there 
fore consider the manner in which science is built up of 
such materials — the process by which they are brought 
into their places and the texture of the bond which 
unites and cements them 



chapteb iv 
of the colligation of facts 

facts such as the last chapter speaks of are by means 
of such conceptions as are described in the preceding 
chapter bound together so as to give rise to those gene

ral propositions of which science consists thus the ct 
that the planets revolve about the sun in certain periodio 
times and at certain distancesy are included and connected 
in keplers law by means of such conceptions as thd 
squares of numbers the cubes of justances and the propor 
tionalify of these quantities again the existence of this 
proportion in the motions of any two planets forms a set 
of hjctb which may all be combined by means of the 
conception of a certain central acoeleratinjf farce as was 
proved by newton the whole of our physical knowledge 
consists in the establishment of such propositions and in 
all such cases facts are bound together by the aid of suit 
able conceptions this part of the formation of our 
knowledge we have called the couigaium of facts and 
we may apply this term to every case in which by an act 
of the intellect we establish a precise connexion among 
the phenomena which are presented to our senses the 
knowledge of such connexions accumulated and syste 
matijded is science on the steps by which science is 
thus collected firom phenomena we shall proceed now to 
make a few remarks 

 science begins with common observation of fects 
in which we are not conscious of any peculiar discipline 
or habit of thought exercised in observing thus the 
common perceptions of the appearances and recurrences 
of the celestial luminaries were the first steps of atro 
nomy the obvious cases in which bodies fall or are 
supported were the beginning of mechanics the familiar 
aspects of visible things were the origin of optics the 
usual distinctions of wellknown plants first gave rise to 
botany facts bdonging to such parts of our knowledge 
are noticed by us and accumulated in our memories in 
the common cmirse of our habits almost without our 
being aware that we are observing and cicting fistcts 
yet such facts may lead to many scientific truths for 



digitized by vjooq ic 



of the colligation of facts 

instance in the first stages of astronomy as we have shown 
in the history such ct lead to methods of intercalation 
and rules of the recurrence of eclipses in succeeding 
stages of science more especial attentioh and preparation 
on the part of the observer and a selection of certain 
kinds of facts becomes necessary but there is an early 
period in the progress of knowledge at which man is a 
physical philosopher without seeking to be so or being 
aware that he is so 

 but in all stages of the progress even in that 
early one of which we have just spoken it is necessary 
in order that the ibcts may be fit materials of any know 
ledge that they should be decomposed into elementary 
facts and these observed with precision thus in the first 
infieincy of astronomy the recurrence of phases of the 
moon of places of the suns rising and setting of planets 
of eclipses was observed to take place at intervals of cer 
tain definite numbers of days and in a certain exact order 
find thus it was that the observations became portions of 
astronomical science in other cases although the facts 
were equally numerous and their general aspect equally 
fiamiliar they led to no science because their exact cir 
cumstances were not apprehended a vague and loose 
mode of looking at facts very easily observable left men 
for a long time under the belief that a body ten times as 
heavy as another falls ten times as fast — that objects 
immersed in water are always magnified without regard 
to the form of the surface — that the magnet exerts an 
irresistible force — that crystal is always found associated 
with ice — and the like these and many others are 
examples how blind and careless man can be even in 
observation of the plainest and commonest appearances 
and they show us that the mere fiiculties of perception 
fdthough constantly exercised upon innumerable objects 
may long fail in leading to any exact knowledge 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 consteucnon of science 

 if we further inquire what was the favourable con 
dition through which some special classes of facts were 
from the first fitted to become portions of science we 
shall find it to have been principally this — that these 
facts were considered with reference to the ideas of time 
number and space whidi are ideas possessing peculiar 
definiteness and precision so that with regard to them 
confusion and indistinctness are hardly possible thd 
interval from new moon to new moon was always a par 
ticular number of days the sun in his yearly course rose 
and set near to a known succession of distant objects 
the moons path passed among the stars in a certain order 
•these are observations in which mistake and obscurity 
are not likely to occur if the smallest degree of attention 
is bestowed upon the task to count a number is 
from the first opening of mans mental fiuulties an ope 
ration which no science can render more precise the 
relations of space are nearest to those of number in 
obvious and universal evidence sciences depending upon 
these ideas arise with the first dawn of intellectual civili 
zation but few of the other ideas which man employs 
in the acquisition of knowledge possess this clearness in 
their common use the idea of resemblance may be 
noticed as coming next to those of space and number in 
original precision and the idea of cause in a certain 
more vague and general mode of application suflicient 
for the purposes of common life but not for the ends of 
science exercises a very extensive influence over mens 
thouts but the other ideas on which science depends 
with the conceptions which arise out of them are not 
unfolded till a much later period of intellectual progress 
and therefore except in such limited cases as i have 
noticed the observations of common spectators and uncul 
tivated nations however numerous or varied are of little 
or no effect in giving rise to science

of the colligation op facts 

 let us now suppose that besides common every 
day perception of facts we turn our attention to some 
other occurrences and appearances with a design of oh 
taining from them speculative knowledge this process 
is more peculiarly called observation or when we our 
selves occasion the facts epperiment but the same re 
mark which we have already made still holds good here 
these facts can be of no value except they are resolved 
into those exact conceptions which contain the essential 
circumstances of the case they must be determined not 
indeed necessarily as has sometimes been said accord 
ing to number weight and measure for as we have 
endeavoured to show in the preceding books there are 
many other conceptions to which phenomena may be 
subordinated quite diiferent from these and yet not at 
all less definite and precise but in order that the facts 
obtained by observation and experiment may be capable 
of being used in furtherance of our exact and solid know 
ledge they must be apprehended and analysed according 
to some conceptions which applied for this purpose give 
distinct and definite results such as can be steadily taken 
hold of and reasoned from that is they must be referred 
to clear and appropriate ideas according to the manner 
in which we have already explained this condition of the 
derivation of our knowledge the phenomena of light 
when they are such as to indicate sides in the ray must 
be referred to the conception of polarization the pheno 
mena of mixture when there is an alteration of qualities 
as well as quantities must be combined by a conception 
of elementary composition and thus when mere position 
and number and resemblance will no longer answer the 
purpose of enabling us to connect the facts we call 
in other ideas in such cases more efficacious though 
less obvious 



 books v vi vii viii ix x 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 construction of science 

 but how are we in these cases to discover such 
ideas and to judge which will be efficacious in leading to 
a scientific combination of our experimental data to 
this question we must in the first place answer that the 
first and great instrument by which facts so observed 
with a view to the formation of exact knowledge are 
combined into important and permanent truths is that 
peculiar sagacity which belongs to the genius of a dis 
coverer and which while it supplies those distinct 
and appropriate conceptions which lead to its success 
cannot be limited by rules or expressed in definitions 
it would be difficult or impossible to describe in words 
the habits of thought which led archimedes to refer the 
conditions of equiubriuiii on the lever to the conception 
of pressure while aristotle could not see in them anything 
more than the results of the strangeness of the properties 
of the circle — or which impelled pascal to explain by 
means of the conception of the weight of air thd fact 
which his predecessors had connected by the notion of 
natures horror of a vacuum — or which caused vitellio 
and roger bacon to refer the magnifying power of a 
convex lens to the bending of the rays of light towards 
the perpendicular by refraction while others conceived 
the effect to result from the matter of medium with no 
consideration of its form these are what are commonly 
spoken of as felicitous and inexplicable strokes of in 
ventive talent and such no doubt they are no rulei 
can ensure to us similar success in new cases or can 
enable men who do not possess similar endowments to 
make like advances in knowledge 

 yet still we may do something in tracing the 
process by which such discoveries are made and this it 
is here our business to do we may observe that these 
and the like discoveries are not improperly described aa 
happy guesses and that guesses in these as in other 



digitized by vjooq ic 



op the ooluoatton op pacts 

lubtances imply various suppositions made of which some 
one tarns out to be the right one we may in such cases 
oonceite the discoverer as inventing and trying many 
conjectures till he finds one which answers the purpose 
of combining the scattered facts into a single rule the 
discovery of general truths from special facts is performed 
commonly at least and more commonly than at first ap 
pears by the use of a series of suppositions or hypothesesy 
which are looked at in quick succession and of which the 
one which really leads to truth is rapidly detected and 
when caught sight of firmly held verified and followed 
to its consequences in the minds of most discoverers 
this process of invention trial and acceptance or rejection 
of the hypothesis goes on so rapidly that we cannot trace 
it in its successive steps but in some instances we can 
do so and we can also see that the other examples of 
discovery do not differ essentially from these the same 
intellectual operations take place in other cases although 
this often happens so instantaneously that we lose the 
trace of the progression in the discveries made by 
kepler we have a curious and memorable exhibition of 
this process in its details thanks to his communicative 
disposition we know that he made nineteen hypotheses 
with regard to the motion of mars and calculated the 
results of each before he established the true doctrine 
that the planets path is an ellipse we know in like 
manner that gralileo made wrong suppositions respecting 
the laws of felling bodies and mariotte concerning the 
motion of water in a siphon before they hit upon the 
correct view of these cases 

 but it has very often happened in the history of 
science that the erroneous hypotheses which preceded 
the discovery of the truth have been made not by the 
discoverer himself but by his precursors to whom he 
thus owed the service often an important one in such

 construction op science 

cases of exhausting the most tempting forms of eiror 
thus the various fruitless suppositions by which kepler 
endeavoured to discover the law of refraction led the 
way to its real detection by snell keplers numerous 
imaginations concerning the forces by which the celestial 
motions are produced — his physical reasonings as he 
termed them — were a natural prelude to the truer physi 
cal reasonings of newton the various hypotheses by 
which the suspension of vapour in air had been explained 
and their fiedlure left the field open for dalton with iiis 
doctrine of the mechanical mixture of gases in most 
cases if we could truly analyse the operation of the 
thoughts of those who make or who endeavour to make 
discoveries in science we should find that many more 
suppositions pass through their minds than those which 
are expressed in words many a possible combination of 
conceptions is formed and soon rejected there is a con 
stant invention and activity a perpetual creating and 
selecting power at work of which the last results only 
are exhibited to us trains of hypotheses are called up 
and pass rapidly in review and the judgment makes its 
choice from the varied group 

 it would however be a great mistake to suppose 
that the hypotheses among which our choice thus lies 
are constructed by an enumeration of obvious cases or 
by a wanton alteration of relations which occur in some 
first hypothesis it may indeed sometimes happen that 
the proposition which is finally established is such as may 
be formed by some slight alteration from those which 
are justly rejected thus keplers elliptical theory of 
marss motions involved relations of lines and angles much 
of the same nature as his previous false suppositions and 
the true law of refraction so much resembles those erro 
neous ones which he tried that we cannot help wondering 
how he chanced to miss it but it more frequently

op the coluaation of faots 

happens that new truths are brought into view by the appli 
cation of new ideas not bj new modifications of old ones 
the cause of the properties of the lever was learnt not 
by introducing any new geometrical combination of lines 
and circles but by referring the properties to genuine 
mechanical conceptions wlien the motions of the pla 
nets were to be explained this was done not by merely 
improving the previous notions of cycles of time but by 
introducing the new conception of epicycles in space 
the doctrine of the four simple elements was expelled 
not by forming any new scheme of elements which should 
impart according to new rules their sensible qualities to 
their compounds but by considering the elements of bodies 
as neutralizing each other the fringes of shadows could 
not be explained by ascribing new properties to the single 
rays of light but were reduced to law by referring them 
to the interference of several rays 

since the true supposition is thus very frequently 
something altogether diverse from all the obvious con 
jectures and combinations we see here how far we are 
from being able to reduce discovery to rule or to give 
any precepts by which the want of real invention and 
sagacity shall be supplied we may warn and encourage 
these faculties when they exist but we cannot create 
them or make great discoveries when they are absent 

 the conceptions which a true theory requires are 
very often clothed in a hypothesis which connects with them 
several superfluous and irrelevant circumstances thus 
the conception of the polarization of light was originally 
represented under the image of particles of light having 
their poles all turned in the same direction the laws of 
heat may be made out perhaps most conveniently by con 
ceiving heat to be a fluid the attraction of gravitation 
might have been successfully applied to the explanation of 
fitcts if newton had throughout treated attraction as the 

vol ii p

 constbuotion of cibncb 

result of an ether dlfiused through space a supposition 
which he hw noticed as a possibility the doctrine of 
definite and multiple proportions may be conveniently 
expressed by the hypothesis of atom in such cases the 
hypothesis may serve at first to facilitate the introduction 
of a new conception thus a pervading ether might for a 
time remove a difficulty which some persons find consider 
ablet of imagining a body to exert force at a distance a 
particle with poles is more easily conceived than polariza 
tion in the abstract and if hypotheses thus employed will 
really explain the facts by means of a few simple assump 
tionsy the laws may afterwards be reduced to a simpler 
form than that in which they were first suggested the 
general laws of heat of attraction of polarization of 
multiple proportions are now certain whatever image we 
may form to ourselves of their ultimate causes 

 in order then to discover scientific truths 
suppositions consisting either of new conceptions or of 
new combinations of old ones are to be made till we 
find one which succeeds in binding together the hcts 
but how are we to find this how is the trial to be 
made what is meant by success in these cases to 
this we reply that our inquiry must be whether the 
facts have the same relation in the hypothesis which 
they have in reality — whether the results of our sup 
positions agree with the phenomena which nature pre 
sents to us for this purpose we must both carefully 
observe the phenomena and steadily trace the conse 
quences of our assumptions till we can imng the two 
into comparison the conceptions which our hypotheses 
involve being derived from certain fundamental ideas 
afford a basis of rigorous reasoning as we have shown in 
the books respecting those ideas and the results to 
which this reasoning leads will be susceptible of being 
verified or contradicted by observation of the foots

thus the epicyouoal theory of the moou once assumed 
detennined ahat the moons place among the stars ought 
to be at any given time and could therefore be tested by 
actually observing the moons places the doctrine that 
musical strings of the same length stretched with weights 
of would give the musical intervals of an 
octave a fifth a fourth in succession could be put to the 
trial by any one whose ear was capable of appreciating 
those intervals and the inference which follows from 
this doctrine by numerical reasoning — that there must be 
certain imperfections in the concords of every musical 
scalecould in like manner be confirmed by tryingvarious 
modes of temperament in like manner all received 
theories in science up to the present time have been

attempt of this kind and obtained some true bond of unity 
by which the phenomena are held together the subject is 
open to further prosecution which ulterior process may 
for the most part be conducted in a more formal and tech 
nical manner the first great outline of the subject is 
drawn and the finishing of the resemblance of nature

less of genius in the master in the pursuance of this

op certain characteristics op scientific 
induction 

 the two operations spoken of in the preceding 
chapters — the explication of the conceptions of our own 
minds and the colligation of observed facts by the aid 
of such conceptions — are as we have just said insepa 
rably connected with each other when united and 
employed in collecting knowledge from the phenomena 
which the world presents to us they constitute the mental 
process of induction which is usually and justly spoken 
of as the genuine source of all our real general knowledge 
respecting the external world and we see from the 
preceding analysis of this process into its two constitu 
ents from what origin it derives each of its characters 
it is real because it arises from the combination of real 
fietcts but it is general because it implies the possession 
of general ideas without the former it would not be 
knowledge of the external world without the latter it 
would not be knowledge at all when ideas and facts 
are separated from each other the neglect of facts gives 
rise to empty speculations idle subtleties visionary inven 
tions false opinions concerning the laws of phenomena 
disregard of the true aspect of nature while the want of 
ideas leaves the mind overwhelmed bewildered and stu 
pified by particular sensations with no means of connect 
ing the past with the future the absent with the present 
the example with the rule open to the impression of all

characteristics op scientific induction 

appearances but capable of appropriating none ideas are 
the form facts the material of our structure knowledge 
does not consist in the empty mould or in the brute 
mass of matter but in the rightlymoulded substance 
induction gathers general truths from particular facts — 
and in her harvest the com and the reaper the solid ears 
and the binding band are alike requisite all our know 
ledge of nature is obtained by induction the term being 
understood according to the explanation we have now 
given and our knowledge is then most complete then 
most truly deserves the name of science when both its 
elements are most perfect — when the ideas which have 
been concerned in its formation have at every step been 
clear and consistent — and when they have at every step 
also been employed in binding together real and certain 
facts of such induction i have already given so many 
examples and illustrations in the two preceding chapters 
that i need not now dwell further upon the subject 

 induction is familiarly spoken of as the process by 
which we collect a general proposition from a number of 
particular cases and it appears to be frequently imagined 
that the general proposition results from a mere juxta 
position of the cases or at most from merely conjoining 
and extending them but if we consider the process 
more closely as exhibited in the cases lately spoken of 
we shall perceive that this is an inadequate account of 
the matter the particular facts are not merely brought 
together but there is a new element added to the combi 
nation by the very act of thought by which they are com 
bined there is a conception of the mind introduced in 
the general proposition which did not exist in any of the 
observed facts when the greeks after long observing 
he motions of the planets saw that these motions might 
be rightly considered as produced by the motion of one 
wheel revolving in the inside of another wheels thsjr 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 construction of science 

wheels were creations of their minds added to the fkcts 
which they perceived by sense and even if the wheels 
were no longer supposed to be material but were reduced 
to mere geometrical spheres or circles they were not 
the less products of the mind alone — something addi 
tional to the facts observed the same is the case in all 
other discoveries the fiacts are known but they are 
insulated and unconnected till the discoverer supplies 
from his own stores a principle of connexion the pearls 
are there but they will not hang together till some one 
provides the string the distances and periods of the 
planets were all so many separate facts by kepws 
third law they are connected into a single truth but 
the conceptions which this law involves were supplied by 
keplers mind and without these the facts were of no 
avail the planets described ellipses round the sun in 
the contemplation of others as well as of newton but 
newton conceived the deflection from the tangent in 
these elliptical motions in a new light — as the effect of 
a central force following a certain law and then it was 
that such a force was discovered truly to exist 

thus in each inference made by induction there 
is introduced some general conception which is given 
not by the phenomena but by the mind the conclu 
sion is not contained in the premises but includes them 
by the introduction of a new generality in order to 
obtain our inference we travel beyond the cases which 
we have before us we consider them as mere exemplifii 
cations of some ideal case in which the relations are com

not because our senses ever disclosed to us a body doing 
this but because taking this as our ideal case we find 
that all actual cases are intelligible and explicable bj 
means of the conception of forces causing change and 
motion and exerted by surrounding bodies in like 
manner we see bodies striking ach other and thus 
moving and stopping accelerating and retarding each 
other but in all this we do not perceive by our senses 
tiiat abstract quantity mommbwn which is always lost 
by one body as it is gained by another this momentum 
is a creation of the ibind brought in among the facts in 
order to convert their apparent confusion into order their 
seeming chance into certainty their perplexing variety 
into simplicity this the conception of momentum 
gained and lost does and in like manner in any other 
case in which a truth is established by induction some 
conception is introduced some idea is applied as the 
means of binding together the facts and thus producing 
the truth 

 hence in every inference by induction there is 
some conception superindiiced upon the facts and we 
may henceforth conceive this to be the peculiar import of 
the term induction i am not to be understood as assert 
ing that the term was originally or anciently employed 
vfith this notion of its meaning for the peculiar feature 
just pointed out in induction has generally been over 
looked this appears by the accounts generally given of 
induction induction says aristotle is when by 
means of one extreme termf we infer the other extreme 
term to be true of the middle term thus to take 
suck exemplifications as belong to our subject from

knowing that mercury venus mars describe ellipses 
about the sun we infer that all planets describe ellipses 
about the sun in making this inference syllogistically 
we assume that the evident proposition mercury venus 
mars do what all planets do may be taken coiwerselff 
all planets do what mercury venus mars do but 
we remark that in this passage aristotle as was natural 
in his line of discussion turns his attention entirely to 
the evidence of the inference and overlooks a step which 
is of far more importance to our knowledge namely the 
ihvefuion of the second extreme term in the above 
instance the particular luminaries mercury venus 
mars are one logical eareme the general designation 
planets is the middle term but having these before us 
how do we come to thinlc of description of euipsesyvihich is 
the other extreme of the syllogism when we have once 
invented this second extreme term we may or may not 
be satisfied with the evidence of the syllogism we may 
or may not be convinced that so far as this property 
goes the extremes are coextensive with the middle 
term but the statement of the syllogism is the important 
step in science we know how long kepler laboured 
how hard he fought how many devices he tried before he 
hit upon this term the elliptical motion he rejected as 
we know many other second extreme terms for example 
various combinations of epicyclical constructions because 
they did not represent with sufficient accuracy the special 
facts of observation when he had established his pre 
miss that mars does describe an ellipse about the sun 
he does not hesitate to yuess at least that in this respect 
he might convert the other premiss and assert that all 
the planets do what mars does but the main business 
was the inventing and verifying the proposition respect

ing the ellipse the inyention of the conception was the 
great step in the discovery the verification of the pro 
position was the great step in the proof of the disco 
very if logic consists in pointing out the conditions 
of proof the logic of induction must consist in show 
ing what are the conditions of proof in such inferences 
as this but this subject must be pursued in the next 
chapter i now speak principally of the act of invention 
which is requisite in every inductive inference 

 although in every inductive inference an act of 
invention is requisite the act soon slips out of notice 
although we bind together facts by superinducing upon 
them a new conception this conception once introduced 
and applied is looked upon as inseparably connected with 
the facts and necessarily implied in them having once 
had the phenomena bound together in their minds in 
virtue of the conception men can no longer easuy restore 
them back to the detached and incoherent condition in 
which they were before they were thus combined the 
pearls once strung they seem to form a chain by their 
nature induction has given them a unity which it is so 
far from costing us an effort to preserve that it requires 
an effort to imagine it dissolved for instance we usually 
represent to ourselves the earth as round the earth and the 
planets as revolving about the sun and as drawn to the 
sun by a central force we can hardly understand how it 
could cost the greeks and copernicus and newton so 
much pains and trouble to arrive at a view which is to us 
so familiar these are no longer to us conceptions caught 
hold of and kept hold of by a severe struggle they are 
the simplest modes of conceiving the facts they are 
really facts we are willing to own our obligation to 
those discoverers but we hardly ye it for in what other 
manner we ask in our thoughts could we represent 
the facts to ourselves

thug we see why it is that this step of which we 
now speak the invention of a new conception in every 
inductive inference is so generally overlooked that it has 
hardly been noticed by preceding philosophers when 
once performed by the discoverer it takes a fixed and per 
manent place in the understanding of every one it is a 
thought which once breathed forth permeates all mens 
minds all fancy they nearly or quite knew it before 
it oft was thought or almost thought though never till 
now expressed men accept it and retain it and know 
it cannot be taken from them and look upon it as their 
own they will not and cannot part with it even though 
they may deem it trivial and obvious it is a secret 
which once uttered cannot be recalled even though it 
be despised by those to whom it is imparted as soon 
as the leading term of a new theory has been pronounced 
and understood all the phenomena change their aspect 
there is a standard to which we cannot help referring 
them we cannot fall back into the helpless and bewil 
dered state in which we gazed at them when we possessed 
no principle which gave them unity eclipses arrive in 
mysterious confusion the notion of a cyde dispels the 
mystery the planets perform a tangled and mazy 
dance but epicydes reduce the maze to order the 
epicycles themselves run into confusion the concep 
tion of an ellipse makes all clear and simple and tiius 
from stage to stage new elements of intelligible order 
are introduced but this intelligible order is so com 
pletely adopted by the human understanding as to seem 
part of its texture men ask whether eclipses follow a 
cycle whether the planets describe ellipses and they 
imagine that so long as they do not answer such ques 
tions rashly they take nothing for granted they do 
not recollect how much they assume in asking the ques 
tion — how far the conceptions of cycles and of eilipsei

are beyond the visible mirface of the celestial phenomena 
how many ages elapsed how much thought how much 
observation were needed before mens thoughts were 
fashioned into the words which they now so fomiliarly 
use and thus they treat the subject as we have seen 
aristotle treating it as if it were a question not of 
invention but of proof not of substance but of form 
as if the main thing were not tvhat we assert but how we 
assert it but for our purpose it is requisite to bear in 
mind the feature which we have thus attempted to mark 
and to recollect that in every inference by induction 
there is a conception supplied by the mind and superin 
duced upon the facts 

 in collecting scientific truths by induction we 
often find as has already been observed a definition 
and a proposition established at the same time — intro 
duced together and mutually dependent on each other 
the combination of the two constitutes the inductive act 
and we may consider the definition as representing the 
superinduced conception and the proposition as exhibit 
ing the colligation of facts 

 to discover a conception of the mind which will 
justly represent a train of observed fiicts is in some mea 
sure a process of coiyecture as i have stated already 
and as i then observed the business of conjecture is 
commonly conducted by calling up before our minds 
several suppositions and selecting that one which most 
agrees with what we know of the observed facts hence 
he who has to discover the laws of nature may have to 
invent many suppositions before he hits upon the right 
one and among the endowments which lead to his suc 
cess we must reckon that fertility of invention which 
ministers to him such imaginary schemes till at last he 
finds the one which conforms to the true order of 
nature a hcuitj in devising hypotheses therefore is

 tslt from being a fault in the intellectual character 
of a discoverer that it is in truth a faculty indispen 
sable to his task it is for his purposes much better 
that he should be too ready in contriving too eager in 
pursuing systems which promise to introduce law and 
order among a mass of imarranged facts than that he 
qhould be barren of such inventions and hopeless of such 
success accordingly as we have already noticed great 
discoverers have often invented hypotheses which would 
not answer to all the facts as well as those which would 
and have fancied themselves to have discovered laws 
which a more careful examination of the facts overturned 
the tendencies of our speculative nature carry 
ing us onwards in pursuit of symmetry and rule and 
thus producing all true theories perpetually show 
their vigour by overshooting the mark they obtain 
something by aiming at much more they detect the 
order and connexion which exist by conceiving imagi 
nary relations of order and connexion which have no 
existence real discoveries are thus mixed with base 
less assumptions profound sagacity is combined with 
fanciful conjecture not rarely or in peculiar instances 
but commonly and in most cases probably in all if 
we could read the thoughts of discoverers as we read 
the books of kepler to try wrong guesses is with 
most persons the only way to hit upon right ones the 
character of the true philosopher is not that he never 
conjectures hazardously but that his conjectures are 
clearly conceived and brought into rigid contact with 
facts he sees and compares distinctly the ideas and

the things — the relations of his notions to each other 
and to phenomena under these conditions it is not 
only excusable but necessary for him to snatch at every 
semblance of general rule— to try all promising forms 
of simplicity and symmetry 

hence advances in knowledge are not commonly 
made without the previous exercise of some boldness and 
license in guessing the discovery of new truths requires 
imdoubtedly minds careful and scrupulous in examining 
what is suggested but it requires no less such as are 
quick and fertile in suggesting what is invention 
except the talent of rapidly calling before us the many 
possibilities and selecting the appropriate one it is 
true that when we have rejected all the inadmissible 
suppositions they are often quickly forgotten and few 
think it necessary to dwell on these discarded hypo 
theses and on the process by which thiey were con 
demned but all who discover truths must have reasoned 
upon many errors to obtain each truth every accepted 
doctrine must have been one chosen out of many candi 
dates if many of the guesses of philosophers of bygone 
times now appear fanciful and absurd because time and 
observation have refuted them others which were at the 
time equally gratuitous have been confirmed in a manner 
which makes them appear marvellously sagacious to 
form hypotheses and then to employ much labour and 
skill in refuting if they do not succeed in establishing 
them is a part of the usual process of inventive minds 
such a proceeding belongs to the rule of the genius of 
discovery rather than as has often been taught in modem 
times to the exception

theses which may connect the phenomena of nature it 
indispisably requisite that he be diligent and careful in 
comparing his hypotheses with the facts and ready to 
abandon his invention as soon as it appears that it does 
not igree with the course of actual occurrences this 
constant comparison of his own conceptions and suppo 
sition with observed facts under all aspects forms the 
leading employment of the discoverer this candid and 
simple love of truth which makes him willing to sup 
press the most favourite production of his own ingenuity 
as soon as it appears to be at variance with realities 
constitutes the first characteristic of his temper he 
must have neither the blindness which cannot nor the 
obstinacy which will not perceive the discrepancy of his

partial views or selfcomplacency or delight in seeming 
demonstration to make him tenacious of the schemes 
which he devises any further than they are confirmed by 
their accordance with nature the framing of hypothec

beginning of his work each of his systems is invented 
not that he may admire it and follow it into all its oont

this character in kepler we have remarked the 
courage and perseverance with which he undertook and 
mcecuted the task of computing his own hypotheses 
and as a still more admirable characteristic that he never 
allowed the labour he had spent upon any conjecture to 
produce any reluctance in abandoning the hypothesis as 
soon as he had evidence of its inaccuracy and in the 
history of newtons discovery that the moon is retained 
in her orbit by the force of gravity we have noticed the 
same moderation in maintaining the hypothesis after it 
had once occurred to the authors mind the hypothesis 
required that the moon should fall from the tangent of 
her wbit every second through a space of sixteen feet 
but according to his first calculations it appeared that in 
ct die only fell through a space of thirteen feet in that 
time the difference seems small the approximation 
encouraging the theory plausible a man in love with 
his own fancies would readily have discovered or invented 
some mbable cause of the difference but newton 
acquiesced in it as a disproof of his conjecture and laid 
aside at that time any further thoughts of this matterf 
 it haa often happened that those who have under 
taken to instruct mankind have not possessed this pure 
love of truth and comparative indifference to the mainr 
tttiance of their own inventions men have frequently 
adhered with great tenacity and vehemence to the hypo 
theses which they have once framed and in their affec 
tion for thaie have been prone to overlook to distort 
and to misinterpret fietcts in this manner hypotheses 
have so often been prejudicial to the genuine pursuit of 
truth that they have fidlen into a kind of obloquy and 
have been considered as dangerous temptations and fal 
lacious guides many warnings have been uttered against 
the fabrication of hypotheses by those who profess to 

• mt ind set i t lb h

teach philosophy many disclaimers of such a course by 
those who cultivate science 

thus we shall find bacon frequently discommending 
this habit imder the name of anticipation of the mind 
and newton thinks it necessary to say emphatically 
hypotheses non fingo it has been constantly urged 
that the inductions by which sciences are formed must 
be caumous and rigorous and the various imaginations 
which passed through keplers brain and to which he 
has given utterance have been blamed or pitied as la 
mentable instances of an unphilosophical frame of mind 
yet it has appeared in the preceding remarks that hypo 
theses rightly used are among the helps far more than 
the dangers of science — that scientific induction is not 
a cautious or a rigorous process in the sense of 
abstaining from such suppositions but in not adhering to 
them till they are confirmed by fact and in carefully 
seeking from facts confirmation or refutation kepler s 
character was not that he was peculiarly given to the 
construction of hypotheses but that he narrated with 
extraordinary copiousness and candour the course of his 
thoughts his labours and his feelings in the minds of 
most persons as we have said the inadmissible supposi 
tions when rejected are soon forgotten and thus the 
trace of them vanishes from the thoughts and the suc 
cessful hypothesis alone holds its place in our memory 
but in reality many other transient suppositions must 
have been made by all discoverers — hypotheses which 
are not afterwards asserted as true systems but enter 
tained for an instant — tentative hypotheses as they 
have been called each of these hypotheses is followed 
by its corresponding train of observations from which it 
derives its power of leading to truth the hypothesis is 
like the captain and the observations like the soldiers of 
an army while he appears to command them and in this

way to work his own will he does in fact derive all his 
power of conquest from their obedience and becomes 
helpless and useless if they mutiny 

since the discoverer has thus constantly to work 
his way onwards by means of hypotheses false and true 
it is highly important for him to possess talents and 
means for rapidly testing each supposition as it offers 
itself in this as in other parts of the work of discovery 
success has in general been mainly owing to the native 
ingenuity and sagacity of the discoverers mind yet 
some rules tending to further this object have been 
delivered by eminent philosophers and some others may 
perhaps be suggested of these we shall here notice 
only some of the most general leaving for a future chap 
ter the consideration of some more limited and detailed 
processes by which in certain cases the discovery of the 
laws of nature may be materially assisted 

 a maxim which it may be useful to recollect 
is this — that hypotheses may often be of service to 
science when they involve a certain portion of incom 
pleteness and even of error the object of such inven 
tions is to bind together facts which without them are 
loose and detached and if they do this they may lead 
the way to a perception of the true rule by which the 
phenomena are associated together even if they them 
selves somewhat misstate the matter the imagined 
arrangement enables us to contemplate as a whole a col 
lection of special cases which perplex and overload our 
minds when they are considered in succession and if 
our scheme has so much of truth in it as to conjin what 
is really connected we may afterwards duly correct or limit 
the mechanism of this connexion if our hypothesis 
renders a reason for the agreement of cases really similar 
we may afterwards find this reason to be false but we 
shall be able to translate it into the language of trutli

a conspicuoufl example of such an hypothesis one 
which was of the highest value to science though very 
incomplete and as a representation of nature altogether 
false is seen in the doctrine of epicycles by which the 
ancient astronomers explained the motions of the sun 
moon and planets this doctrine connected the places 
and velocities of these bodies at particular times in a 
manner which was in its general features agreeable to 
nature yet this doctrine was erroneous in its assertion 
of the circular nature of ii the celestial motions and in 
making the heavenly bodiis revolve round the earth it 
was however of immense value to the progress of astro 
nomical science for it enabled men to express and 
reason upon many important truths which they discovered 
respecting the motion of the stars up to the time of 
keplier indeed we can hardly imagine that astronomy 
could in its outset have made so great a progress under 
any other form as it did in consequence of being cul 
tivated in this shape of the incomplete and mm epicy 
clical hypothesis 

we may notice another instance of an exploded hypo 
thesis which is generally mentioned only to be ridiculed 
and which undoubtedly is both false in the extent of its 
assertion and unphilosophical in its expression but 
which still in its day was not without merit i mean 
the doctrine of natures horror of a vacuum fuga vacuh 
by which the action of siphons and pumps and many 
other phenomena were explained till mersenne and pas 
cal taught a truer doctrine this hypothesis was of real 
service for it brought together many fiacts which really 
belong to the same class although they are very different 
in their first aspect a scientific writer of modem times 
appears to wonder that men did not at once divine the 
weight of the air from which the phenomena formerly

ascribed to the fuga vacui really result loaded com 
pressed by the atmosphere he says they did not recog 
nize its action in vain all nature testified that air was 
elastic and heavy they shut their eyes to her testimony 
the water rose in pumps and flowed in siphons at that 
tinle as it does at this day they could not separate the 
boards of a pair of bellows of which the holes were 
stopped and they could not bring together the same 
boards without difficulty if they were at first separated 
infants sucked the milk of their mothers air entered 
rapidly into the lungs of animals at every inspiration 
cuppingglasses produced tumours on the skin and in 
spite of all these striking proofs of the weight and elas 
ticity of the air the ancient philosophers maintained 
resolutely that air was light and explained all these 
phenomena by the horror which they said nature had for 
a vacuum it is curious that it should not have occurred 
to the author while writing this that if these facts so 
numerous and various can all be accounted for by one 
principle there is a strong presumption that the principle 
is not altogether baseless and in reality is it not true 
that natiire does abhor a vacuum and do all she can to 
avoid it no doubt this power is not unlimited and 
we can trace it to a mechanical cause the pressure of the 
circumambient air but the tendency arising from this 
pressure which the bodies surrounding a space void of 
air have to rush into it may be expressed in no extra 
vagant or unintelligible manner by saying that nature 
has a repugnance to a vacuum 

that imperfect and false hypotheses though they 
may thus explain some phenomena and may be useful in 
the progress of science cannot explain all phenomena 
— and that we are never to rest in our labours or acqui 
esce in our results till we have found some view of the 
subject which is consistent with all the observed facts —

will of course be understood we shall afterwards have 
to speak of the other steps of such a progress 

 the hypotheses which we accept ought to explain 
phenomena which we have observed but they ought to 
do more than this they ought to foretel phenomena 
which have not yet been observed — at least all of the 
same kind as those which the hypothesis was invented to 
explain for our assent to the hypothesis implies that 
it is held to be true of all particular instances that 
these cases belong to past or to future times that they 
have or have not already occurred makes no difference 
in the applicability of the rule to them because the 
rule prevails it includes all cases and will determine 
them all if we can only calculate its real consequences 
hence it will predict the results of new combinations as 
well as explain the appearances which have occurred in 
old ones and that it does this with certainty and cor 
rectness is one mode in which the hypothesis is to be 
verified as right and useful 

the scientific doctrines which have at various periods 
been established have been verified in this manner for 
example the epicyclical theory of the heavens was con 
firmed by its predicting truly eclipses of the sun and 
moon configurations of the planets and other celestial 
phenomena and by its leading to the construction of 
tables by which the places of the heavenly bodies were 
given at every moment of time the truth and accuracy 
of these predictions were a proof that the hypothesis was 
valuable and at least to a great extent true although 
as was afterwards found it involved a false representation 
of the structure of the heavens in like manner the 
discovery of the laws of refraction enabled mathema 
ticians to predict by calculation what would be the 
effect of any new form or combination of transparent 
lenses newtotfs hypothesis of fits of easy transiiiis

sion and easy reflection in the particles of light although 
not confirmed by other kinds of facts involved a true 
statement of the law of the phenomena which it was 
framed to include and served to predict the forms and 
colours of thin plates for a wide range of given cases 
the hypothesis that light operates by undulations and 
interferences afforded the means of predicting results 
under a still larger extent of conditions in like manner 
in the progress of chemical knowledge the doctrine of 
phlogiston supplied the means oi yreseeiiig the conse 
quence of many combinations of elements even before 
they were tried but the oxygen theory besides afford 
ing predictions at least equally exact with regard to the 
general results of chemical operations included all the 
facts concerning the relations of weight of the elements 
and their compounds and enabled chemists to fyiesee 
such facts in untried cases and the theory of electro 
magnetic forces as soon as it was rightly understood 
enabled those who had mastered it to predict motions 
such as had not been before observed which were accord 
ingly found to take place 

men cannot help believing that the laws laid down by 
discoverers must be in a great measure identical with the 
real laws of nature when the discoverers thus determine 
effects beforehand in the same manner in which nature 
herself determines them when the occasion occurs those 
who can do this must to a considerable extent have de 
tected natures secret — must have fixed upon the condi 
tions to which she attends and must have seized the rules 
by which she applies them such a coincidence of untried 
facts with speculative assertions cannot be the work of 
chance but implies some large portion of truth in the 
principles on which the reasoning is founded to trace 
order and law in that which has been observed may be 
considered as interpreting what nature has written down

for us and will commonly prove that we understand her 
alphabet but to predict what has not been observed is 
to attempt ourselves to use the legislative phrases of 
nature and when she responds plainly and precisely to 
that which we thus utter we cannot but suppose that we 
have in a great measure made ourselves masters of the 
meaning and structure of her language the prediction 
of results even of the same kind as those which have 
been observed in new cases is a proof of real success in 
our inductive processes 

 we have here spoken of the prediction of facts 
of the same kind as those from which our rule was col 
lected but the evidence in favour of our induction is 
of a much higher and more forcible character when it 
enables us to explain and determine cases of a kind 
different from those which were contemplated in the 
formation of our hypothesis the instances in which 
this has occurred indeed impress us with a conviction 
that the truth of our hypothesis is certain no accident 
could give rise to such an extraordinary coincidence no 
false supposition could after being adjusted to one class 
of phenomena so exactly represent a different class when 
the agreement was unforeseen and uncontemplated that 
rules springing from remote and unconnected quarters 
should thus leap to the same point can only arise from 
that being the point where truth resides 

accordingly the cases in which inductions from classes 
of facts altogether different have thus jumped together 
belong only to the best established theories which the 
history of science contains and as i shall have occasion 
to refer to this peculiar feature in their evidence i will 
take the liberty of describing it by a particular phrase 
and will term it the consilience of inductions

doctrine of the attraction of the sun varying according to 
the inverse square of this distance which explained 
keplers third law of the proportionality of the cubes of 
the distances to the squares of the periodic times of the 
planets explained also his first and second laws of the 
elliptical motion of each planet although no connexion 
of these laws had been visible before again it appeaied 
that the force of universal gravitation which had been 
inferred from the perturbations of tlie moon and planets 
by the sun and by each other also accounted for the fect 
apparently altogether dissimilar and remote of the pre 
cession of the equinoaes here was a most striking and 
surprising coincidence which gave to the theory a stamp 
of truth beyond the power of ingenuity to counterfeit 
in like manner in optics the hypothesis of alternate fits 
of easy transmission and reflection would explain the 
colours of thin plates and indeed was devised and ad 
justed for that very purpose but it could give no account 
of the phenomena of the fringes of shadows but the 
doctrine of interferences constructed at first with refers 
ence to phenomena of the nature of thefringesy explained 
also the colours of thin plates better than the supposition 
of the fits invented for that very purpose and we have 
in physical optics another example of the same kind 
which is quite as striking as the explanation of precession 
by inferences from the facts of perturbation the doc 
trine of undulations propagated in a spheroidal form was 
contrived at first by huyghens with a view to explain 
the laws of double refraction in calchspar and was pur 
sued with the same view by fresnel but in the course 
of the investigation it appeared in a most unexpected 
and wonderful manner that this same doctrine of sphe 
roidal undulations when it was so modified as to account 
for the directions of the two refracted rays accounted 
also for the positions of their planes of polarization a

previous mathematicians even to represent 

the theory of universal gravitation and of the nndu

this consilience of inductions with regard to the latter

drawn from distant parts of tho subject which are pro 
perly thus described thus the lams of the modijication 
of polarization to which fresnel was led by his general 
views accounted for the rule respecting the angle at 
which light is polarized discovered by brewsterf the 
conceptions of the theory pointed out peculiar modifca 
tions of the phenomena when newtons nngs were pro 
duced by polarized light which were ascertained to take 
place in fact by arago and airy when the beautiful 
phenomena of dipolarized light were discovered by arago 
and biot young mas able to declare that they were 
reducible to the general laws of interference which he 
had already established and what was no less striking 
a confirmation of the truth of the theory measures of the 
same element deduced from various classes of facts were 
found to coincide thus the length of a luminiferous 
undulation calculated by young from the measurement 
of fringes of shadows was found to agree very nearly with 
the previous calculation from the colours of thin plates 

no example can be pointed out in the whole history 
of science so far as i am aware in which this consilience 
of inductions has given testimony in favour of an hypo 
thesis afterwards discovered to be false if we take one 
class of facts only knowing the law which they follow 
we may construct an hypotheses or perhaps several 
which may represent them and as new circumstances are

discovered we may often adjust tbe hypothesis so as to 
correspond to these also but when the hypothesis of 
itself and without adjustment for the purpose gives 
us the rule and reason of a class of facts not contem 
plated in its construction we have a criterion of its 
reality which has never yet been produced in favour of 
falsehood 

 in the preceding section i have spoken of the 
hypothesis with which we compare our facts as being 
framed au at once each of its parts being included in 
the original scheme in reality however it often happens 
that the various suppositions which our system contains 
are added upon occasion of different researches thus in 
the ptolemaic doctrine of the heavens new epicycles and 
eccentrics were added as new inequalities of the motions 
of the heavenly bodies were discovered and in the 
newtonian doctrine of material rays of light the suppo 
sition that these rays had fits was added to explain 
the colours of thin plates and the supposition that they 
had sides was introduced on occasion of the pheno 
mena of polarization in like manner other theories have 
been built up of parts devised at different times 

this being the mode in which theories are often 
framed we have to notice a distinction which is found to 
prevail in the progress of true and of false theories in 
the former class all the additional suppositions tend to 
simplicity and harmony the new suppositions resolve 
themselves into the old ones or at least require only 
some easy modification of the hypothesis first assumed 
the system becomes more coherent as it is further ex 
tended the elements which we require for explaining 
a new class of facts are already contained in our system 
different members of the theory run together and we 
have thus a constant convergence to unity in false 
theories the contrary is the case the new suppositions

are something altogether additional — not suggested by 
the original scheme perhaps difficult to reconcile with 
it every such addition adds to the complexity of the 
hypothetical system which at last becomes unmanageable 
and is compelled to surrender its place to some simpler 
explanation 

such a false theory for example was the ancient 
doctrine of eccentrics and epicycles it explained the 
general succession of the places of the sun moon and 
planets it would not have explained the proportion of 
their magnitudes at different times if these could have 
been accurately observed but this the ancient astrono 
mers were unable to do when however tycho and other 
astronomers came to be able to observe the planets 
accurately in all positions it was found that no combina 
tion of equable circular motions would exactly represent 
all the observations we may see in keplers works the 
many new modifications of the epicyclical hypothesis 
which offered themselves to him some of which would 
have agreed with the phenomena with a certain degree of 
accuracy but not so great a degree as kepler fortunately 
for the progress of science insisted upon obtaining after 
these epicycles had been thus accumulated they all disap 
peared and gave way to the simpler conception of an 
elliptical motion in like manner the discovery of new 
inequalities in the moons motions encumbered her system 
more and more with new machinery which was at last 
rejected all at once in favour of the elliptical theory 
astronomers could not but suppose themselves in • a 
wrong path when the prospect grew darker and more 
entangled at every step 

again the cartesian system of vortices might be 
said to explain the primary phenomena of the revolutions 
of planets about the sun and satellites about planets 
but the elliptical form of the orbits required new suppo

chabactbeictics op scientific induction 

sitions bernoulli ascribed this curve to the shape of the 
planet operating on the stream of the vortex in a manner 
similar to the rudder of a boat but then the motions of 
the aphelia and of the nodes — the perturbations— even 
the action of gravity to the earth — could not be accounted 
for without new and independent suppositions here 
was none of the simplicity of truth the theory of 
gravitation on the other hand became more simple as 
the facts to be explained became more numerous the 
attraction of the sun accounted for the motions of the 
planets the attraction of the planets was the cause of 
the motion of the satellites but this being assumed the 
perturbations the motions of the nodes and aphelia only 
made it requisite to extend the attraction of the sun to 
the satellites and that of the planets to each other — the 
tides the spheroidal form of the earth the precession 
still required nothing more than that the moon and sun 
should attract the parts of the earth and that these 
should attract each other— so that all the suppositions 
resolved themselves into the single one of the universal 
gravitation of all matter it is difficult to imagine a 
more convincing manifestation of simplicity and unity 

again to take an example from another science — 
the doctrine of phlogiston brought together many fiwjts 
in a very plausible manner — combustion acidification and 
others — and very naturally prevailed foi a while but the 
balance came to be used in chemical operations and the 
facts of weight as well as of combination were to be 
accounted for on the phlogistic theory it appeared that 
this could not be done without a new supposition and 
thai a very strange one — that phlogiston was an element 
not only not heavy but absolutely light so that it dimi 
nished the weight of the compounds into which it entered 
some chemists for a time adopted this extravagant view 
but the wiser of them saw in the necessity of such a 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 construction of science 

supposition to the defence of the theory an evidence that 
the hypothesis of an element phlogiston was erroneous 
and the opposite hypothesis which taught that oxygen 
was subtracted and not phlogiston added was accepted 
because it required no such novel and inadmissible as 
sumption 

again we find the same evidence of truth in the 
progress of the undulatory theory of light in the course 
of its application from one class of fects to another 
thus we explain reflection and refraction by undulations 
when we come to thin plates the requisite fits are 
already involved in our fundamental hypothesis for they 
are the length of an undulation the phenomena of dif 
fraction also require such intervals and the intervals 
thus required agree exactly with the others in magnitude 
so that no new property is needed polarization for a 
moment appears to require some new hypothesis yet 
this is hardly the case for the direction of our vibrations 
i hitherto arbitrary — we allow polarization to decide it 
and we suppose the undulations to be transverse having 
done this for the sake of polarization we turn to the 
phenomena of double refraction and inquire what new 
hypothesis they require but the answer is that they 
require none the supposition of transverse vibrations 
which we have made in order to explain polarization 
gives us also the law of double refraction truth may 
give rise to such a coincidence falsehood cannot again 
the facts of dipolarization come into view but they 
hardly require any new assumption for the difference of 
optical elasticity of crystals in different directions which 
is already assumed in uniaxal crystals is extended to 
biaxal exactly according to the law of symmetry and 
this being done the laws of the phenomena curious and 
complex as they are are fully explained the phenomena

of circular polarization by internal reflection instead of 
requiring a new hypothesis are found to be given by an 
interpretation of an apparently inexplicable result of an 
old hypothesis the circular polarization of quartz and 
its double refraction does indeed appear to require a new 
assumption but still not one which at all disturbs the 
form of the theory and in short the whole history of 
this theory is a progress constant and steady often stri 
king and startling from one degree of evidence and con 
sistence to another of higher order 

in the emission theory on the other hand as in the 
theory of solid epicycles we see what we may consider 
as the natural course of things in the career of a false 
theory such a theory may to a certain extent explain 
the phenomena which it was at first contrived to meet 
but every new class of facts requires a new supposition— 
an addition to the machinery and as observation goes 
on these incoherent appendages accumulate till they 
overwhelm and upset the original framework such has 
been the hypothesis of the material emission of light 
in its original form it explained reflection and refraction 
but the colours of thin plates added to it the fits of easy 
transmission and reflection the phenomena of diffraction 
further invested the emitted particles with complex laws 
of attraction and repulsion polarization gave them sides 
double refraction subjected them to peculiar forces ema 
nating from the axes of the crystal finally dipolarization 
loaded them with the complex and unconnected con 
trivance of moveable polarization and even when all 
this had been done additional mechanism was wanting 
there is here no unexpected success no happy coinci 
dence no convergence of principles from remote quar 
ters the philosopher builds the machine but its parts 
do not fit they hold together only while he presses 
them this is not the character of truth 

as another eximple of the application of the maxim

 construction of science 

now under consideration i may perhaps be allowed to 
refer to the judgment which in the history of ther 
motics i have ventured to give respecting laplaces 
theory of gases i have stated that we cannot help 
forming an unfavourable judgment of this theory by 
looking for that great characteristic of true theory 
namely that the hypotheses which were assumed to 
account for one doss of facts are found to explain another 
class of a different nature thus laplaces first supposi 
tions explain the connexion of compression with density 
the law of boyle and mariotte and the connexion of 
elasticity with heat the law of dalton and gay lussac 
but the theory requires other assumptions when we come 
to latent heat and yet these new assumptions produce 
no effect upon the calculations in any application of the 
theory when the hypothesis constructed with refer 
ence to the elasticity and temperature is applied to 
another class of facts those of latent heat we have no 
simplification of the hypothesis and therefore no evi 
dence of the truth of the theory 

 the two last sections of this chapter direct our 
attention to two circumstances which tend to prove in 
a manner which we may term irresistible the truth of 
the theories which they characterize — the consilience of 
inductions from different and separate classes of facts 
— and the progressive simplification of the theory as it 
is extended to new cases these two characters are in 
fact hardly different they are exemplified by the same 
cases for if these inductions collected from one class 
of facts supply an unexpected explanation of a new class 
which is the case first spoken of there will be no need 
for new machinery in the hypothesis to apply it to the 
newlycontemplated facts and thus we have a case in 
which the system does not become more complex when 
its application is extended to a wider field which waa

the character of true theory in its second aspect the 
consiliences of our inductions give rise to a constant 
convergence of our theory towards simplicity and unity 
but moreover both these cases of the extension of 
the theory without difficulty or new suppositions to a 
wider range and to new classes of phenomena may be cou 
veniently considered in yet another point of view namely 
as successive steps by which we gradually ascend in our 
speculative views to a higher and higher point of gene 
rality for when the theory either by the concurrence of 
two indications or by an extension without complication 
has included a new range of phenomena we have in fact 
a new induction of a more general kind to which the 
inductions formerly obtained are subordinate as particidar 
cases to a general proposition we have in such exam 
ples in short an instance of successive generalizamon 
this is a subject of great importance and deserving of 
being well illustrated it will come under our notice in 
the next chapter 



chaptbb vi 
of the logic of induction 

 the subject to which the present chapter refers is 
described by phrases which are at the present day fami 
liarly used in speaking of the progress of knowledge 
we hear very frequent mention of ascending from par 
hcular to general propositions and from these to propo 
sitions still more general — of truths induded in other 
truths of a higher degree of generality — of different 
stages of generalization — and of the highest step of the 
process of discovery to which all others are subordinate 
and preparatory as these expressions so familiar to our

 construction of science 

ears especially since the time of francis bacon denote 
very significantly processes and relations which are of 
great importance in the formation of science it is neces 
sary for us to give a clear account of them illustrated 
with general exemplifications and this we shall endeavour 
to do 

we have indeed already explained that science con 
sists of propositions which include the facts from wliich 
they were collected and other wider propositions col 
lected in like manner from the former and including 
them thus that the stars the moon the sun rise cul 
minate and set are facts included in the proposition that 
the heavens carrying with them all the celestial bodies 
have a diurnal revolution about the axis of the earth 
again the observed monthly motions of the moon and 
the annual motions of the sun are included in certain 
propositions concerning the movements of those lumi 
naries with respect to the stars but all these proposi 
tions are really included in the doctrine that the earth 
revolving on its axis moves round the sun and the 
moon round the earth these movements again consi 
dered as facts are explained and included in the state 
ment of the forces which the earth exerts upon the moon 
and the sun upon the earth again this doctrine of 
the forces of these two bodies is included in the asser 
tion that all the bodies of the solar system and all parts 
of matter exert forces each upon each and we might 
easily show that all the leading fiwjts in astronomy are 
comprehended in the same generalization in like man 
mer with regard to any other science so far as its truths 
have been well established and folly developed we might 
show that it consists of a gradation of propositions pro 
ceeding from the most special facts to the most general 
theoretical assertions we shall exhibit this gradation 
in some of the principal branches of science 



digitized by vjooq ic 



the logic of induction 

 this gradation of truths successively included in 
other truths may be conveniently represented by times 
resembling the genealogical tables by which the deriva 
tion of descendants from a common ancestor is exhibited 
except that it is proper in this case to invert the form of 
the table and to make it converge to unity downwards 
instead of upwards since it has for its purpose to express 
not the derivation of many from one but the collection 
of one truth from many things two or more coordinate 
facts or propositions may be ranged side by side and 
joined by some mark of connexion a bracket as — v — 

or beneath which may be placed the more 

general proposition which is collected by induction from 
the former again propositions coordinate with this 
more general one may be placed on a level with it and 
the combination of these and the result of the combina 
tion may be indicated by brackets in the same manner 
and so on through any number of gradations by this 
means the streams of knowledge from various classes of 
facts will constantly run together into a smaller and smaller 
number of channels like the confluent rivulets of a great 
river coming together from many sources uniting their 
ramifications so as to form larger branches these again 
uniting in a single trunk the genealogical tree of each 
great portion of science thus formed will contain all the 
leading truths of the science arranged in their due co 
ordination and subordination such tables constructed 
for the sciences of astronomy and of optics vrtll be given 
at the end of this chapter 

 the union of coordinate propositions into a pro 
position of a higher order which occurs in this tree of 
science wherever two twigs unite in one branch is in 
each case an example of induction the single propo 
sition is collected by the process of induction from its 
several members but here we may observe tliat the 

vol ii r

imfl confftrucnon op science 

image of a mere union of the parts at each of these 
jkints which the figure of a tree or a river presents is 
tery inadequate to convey the true state of the case for 
in induction as we have seen besides mere collection of 
ipartioulars there is always a iew conception a principle 
of connexion and unity supplied by the mind and super 
induced upon the particulars there is not merely a 
juxtaposition of materials by which the new proposition 
contains all that its component parts contained but also 
a formative act exerted by the understanding so that 
these materials are contained in a new shape we must 
liemember therefore that our inductive tables although 
they represent the elements and the order of these induc 
tive steps do not fully represent the whole signification 
of the process in each case 

 the principal features of the progress of science 
spoken of in the last chapter are clearly exhibited in 
these tables namely the consilience of inductumsy and 
the constant tendency to simplicity observable in true 
theories indeed in all cases in which from propositions 
of considerable generality propositions of a still higher 
degree are obtained there is a convergence of inductions 
and if in one of the lines which thus converge the steps 
be tidlj and suddenly made in order to meet the 
other line we may consider that we have an example of 
consilience thus when newton had collected from 
keplers laws the central force of the sun and from 
these combined with other fiujts the universal force of 
all the heavenly bodies he suddenly turned round to 
include in his generalization the precession of the equi 
noxes which he declared to arise from the attraction of 
the sun imd moon upon the protuberant part of the ter 
reatrial iheroid the apparent remoteness of this fitet 
in its nature from the others with which he thus asso 
ciated it causes this part of his reasoning to strike us

the locjto op wtvmoif 

fti k remarkable example of consilience achingly 
in the table of astronomy we find that the column 
which contain the facts and theories relative to the mn 
and planets after exhibiting several stages of induction 
within themselves are at length suddenly connected with 
ft column till then quite distinct containing the precession 
of the equinmes in like manner in the table of optics 
the columns which contain the facts and theories relative 
to dotibk refraction and those which include polarisation 
by crystals each go separately through several stages of 
induction and then these two sets of columns are sud 
denly connected by fresners mathematical induction that 
double refraction and polarization arise from the same 
cause thus exhibiting a remarkable consilience 

 the constant tendency to simplicity in the sciences 
of which the progress is thus represented appears from 
the form of the table itself for the single trunk into 
which all the branches converge contains in itself the 
substance of all the propositions by means of which this 
last generalization was arrived at it is true that this 
ultimate result is sometimes not so simple as in the table 
it appears for instance the ultimate generalization of 
the table exhibiting the progress of phyirical optics— 
namely that light consists in undulations — must be 
understood as including some other hypotheses as that 
the undulations are transverse that the ether tlirougli 
which they are propagated has its elasticity in crystals 
and other transparent bodies regulated by certain laws 
and the like yet still even acknowledging all the com 
plication thus implied the table in question evidences 
clearly enough the constant advance tovrards unity con 
sistency and simplicity which have marked the progress 
of this tlieory the same is the case in the inductive 
table of astronomy in a still greater degree 

 these tables naturally afford the opportunity of 

r

assigning to each of the distinct steps of which the pro 
gress of science consists the name of the discoverer to 
whom it is due every one of the inductive processes 
which the brackets of our tables mark directs our atten 
tion to some person by whom the induction was first 
distinctly made these names i have endeavoured to 
put in their due places in the tables ftnd the inductive 
tree of our knowledge in each science becomes in this 
way an exhibition of the claims of each discoverer to 
distinction and as it were a genealogical tree of scien 
tific nobility it is by no mean pretended that such a 
tree includes the names of all the meritorious labourers 
in each department of science many persons are most 
usefully employed in collecting and verifying truths who 
do not advance to any new truths the labours of a 
number of such are included in each stage of our ascent 
but such tables as we have now before us will present 
to us the names of all the most eminent discoverers for 
the main steps of which the progress of science consists 
are transitions from more particular to more general 
truths and must therefore be rightly given by these 
tables and those must be the greatest names in science 
to whom the principal events of its advance are thus due 
 the tables as we have presented them exhibit 
the course by which we pass from particular to general 
through various gradations and so to the most general 
they display the order of discovery but by reading 
them in an inverted manner beginning at the single 
comprehensive truths with which the tables end and 
tracing these back into the more partial truths and these 
again into special facts they answer another purpose — 
they exhibit the process of verification of discoveries once 
made for each of our general propositions is true in 
virtue of the truth of the narrower propositions which it 
involves and we cannot satisfy ourselves of its truth in

the logic op induction 

any other way than by ascertaining that these its consti 
tuent elements are true to assure ourselves that the 
sun attracts the planets with forces varying inversely as 
the square of the distance we must analyse by geometry 
the motion in an ellipse about the focus so as to see 
that it does imply such a force we must also verify 
those calculations by which the observed places of each 
planet are stated to be included in an ellipse these cal 
culations involve assumptions respecting the path which 
the earth describes about the sun which assumptions 
must again be verified by reference to observation and 
thus proceeding from step to step we resolve the most 
general truths into their constituent parts and these 
again into their parts and by testing at each step both 
the reality of the asserted ingredients and the propriety 
of the conjunction we establish the whole system of 
truths however wide and various it may be 

 it is a very great advantage in such a mode of 
exhibiting scientific truths that it resolves the verifica 
tion of the most complex and comprehensive theories 
into a number of small steps of which almost any one 
falls within the reach of common talents and industry 
that if the particulars of any one step be true the gene 
ralization also is true any person with a mind properly 
disciplined may satisfy himself by a little study that 
each of these particular propositions is true may be ascer 
tained by the same kind of attention when this propo 
sition is resolved into its constituent and more special 
propositions and thus we may proceed till the most 
general truth is broken up into small and manageable 
portions of these portions each may appear by itself 
narrow and easy and yet they are so woven together by 
hypothesis and conjunction that the truth of the parts 
necessarily assures us of the truth of the whole the 
verification is of the same nature as the verification of a

large and complex statement of great mm reoty by 
a mereantile office on various accounts from many quarters 
the statement is separated into certain eomprehensive 
heads and these into others less extensive and these 
again into smaller collections of separate articles each of 
which can be inquired into and reported on by separate 
persons and thus at last the mere addition of numbers 
performed by these various persons and the summation 
of the results which they obtain executed by other ac 
countants is a complete and entire security that there is 
no error in the whole of the process 

 this comparison of the process by which we verify 
scientific truth to the process of bookkeeping in a large 
commercial establishment may appear to some persons 
not sufficiently dignified for the subject but in fact 
the possibility of giving this formal and businesslike 
aspect to the evidence of science as involved in the pro 
cess of successive generalization is an inestimable ad 
vantage for if no one could pronounce concerning 
a wide and profound theory except he who could at once 
embrace in his mind the whole range of inference ex 
tending from the special facts up to the most general 
principles none but the greatest geniuses would be en 
titled to judge concerning the truth or error of scientific 
discoveries but in reality we seldom need to verify 
more than one or two steps of such discoveries at one 
time and this may commonly be done when the dis 
eoveries have been fully established and developed by 
any one who brings to the task clear conceptions and 
steady attention the progress of science is gradual 
the discoveries which are successively made are also 
verified successively we have never any very large 
collections of them on our hands at once the doubts 
and uncertainties of any one who has studied science 
with care and perseverance are generally confined to a

few points if he can satisfy himself upon these he has 
no misgivings respecting the rest of the structure which 
has indeed heen repeatedly verified by other persons in 
like manner the fact that science is capable of being 
resolved into separate processes of verification is that which 
renders it possible to form a great body of scientific truth 
by adding together a vast number of truths of which 
many men at various times and by multiplied efibrts have 
satisfied themselves the treasury of science is constantly 
rich and abundant because it accumulates the wealth 
which is thus gathered by so many and reckoned over by 
so many more and the dignity of knowledge is no more 
lowered by the multiplicity of the tasks on which her 
servants are employed and the narrow field of labour to 
which some confine themselves than the rich merchant 
is degraded by the number of offices which it is necessary 
for him to maintain and the minute articles of which he 
requires an exact statement from his accountants 

 the analysis of doctrines inductively obtained 
into their constituent facts and the arrangement of them 
in such a form that the conclusiveness of the induction 
may be distinctly seen may be termed the logic of in 
duction by logic has generally been meant a system 
which teaches us so to arrange our reasonings that their 
truth or falsehood shall be evident in their form in 
deductive reasonings in which the general principles are 
assumed and the question is concerning their application 
and combination in particular cases the device which thus 
enables us to judge whether our reasonings are conclusive 
is the syllogism and this forfn along with the rules 
which belong to it does in fact supply us with a criterion 
of deductive or demonstrative reasoning the inductive 
table such as it is presented in the present chapter in 
like manner supplies the means of ascertaining the truth 
of our inductive inferences so far as the form in which 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 construction of science 

our reasoning may be stated can afford such a criterion 
of course some care is requisite in order to reduce a 
train of demonstration into the form of a series of syl 
logisms and certainly not less thought and attention 
are required for resolving all the main doctrines of any 
great department of science into a graduated table of 
coordinate and subordinate inductions but in each 
case when this task is once executed the evidence or 
veant of evidence of our conclusions appears at once in a 
most luminous manner in each step of induction our 
table enumerates the particular facts and states the gene 
ral theoretical truth which includes these and which these 
constitute the special act of attention by which we satisfy 
ourselves that the facts are so included — that the general 
truth is so constituted — then affords little room for error 
with moderate attention and clearness of thought 

 we may find an example of this act of attention 
thus required at any one of the steps of induction in our 
tables for instance at the step iu the early progress of 
astronomy at which it was inferred that the earth is a 
globe and that the sphere of the heavens performs a diurnal 
revolution round this globe of the earth how was this 
established in the belief of the greeks and how is it fixed 
in our conviction as to the globular form we find that 
as we travel to the north the apparent pole of the heavenly 
motions and the constellations which are near it seem to 
mount higher and as we proceed southwards they descend 
again if we proceed from two different points consi 
derably to the east and west of each other and travel 
directly northwards from each as from the south of spain 
to the north of scotland and from greece to scandinavia 
these two north and south lines will be much nearer to 
each other in their northern than in their southern parts 
these and similar facts as soon as they are clearly esti 
mated and connected in the mind are seen to be consist

tent with a convex surface of the earth and with no 
other and this notion is further confirmed by observing 
that the boundary of the earths shadow upon the moon 
is always circular it being supposed to be already esta 
blished that the moon rieceives her light from the sun 
and that lunar eclipses are caused by the interposition of 
the earth as for the assertion of the diurnal revolution 
of the starry sphere it is merely putting the visible phe 
nomena in an exact geometrical form and thus we esta 
wish and verify the doctrine of the revolution of the 
sphere of the heavens about the globe of the earth by 
contemplating it so as to see that it does really and 
exactly include the particular facts from which it is 
collected 

we may in like manner illustrate this mode of veri 
fication by any of the other steps of the same table 
thus if we take the great induction of copernicus the 
heliocentric scheme of the solar system we find it in the 
table exhibited as including and explaining firsts the 
diurnal revolution just spoken of second thfe motions of 
the moon among the fixed stars thirds the motions of 
the planets with reference to the fixed stars and the sun 
fouhh the motion of the sun in the ecliptic and the 
scheme being clearly conceived we see that all the par 
ticular facts are faithfully represented by it and this 
agreement along with the simplicity of the scheme in 
which respect it is so far superior to any other conception 
of the solar system persuade us that it is really the plan 
of nature 

in exactly the same way if we attend to any of the 
several remarkable discoveries of newton which form 
the principal steps in the latter part of the table as for 
instance the proposition that the sun attracts all the 
planets with a force which varies inversely as the square 
of the distance we find it proved by its including three

 conbthucnon op kaenob 

other propositions previously established ifirsu that the 
suns mean foroe on different planets follows the specified 
variation which is proved from keplers third law 
second iha the force by which each planet is acted upon 
in different parts of its orbit tends to the sun which is 
proved by the equable description of areas thirds that 
this force in different parts of the same orbit is also 
inversely as the square of the distance which is proved 
from the elliptical form of the orbit and the new 
tonian generalization when its consequences are mathec 
matically traced is seen to agree with each of these par 
ticular propositions and thus is fully established 

 but when we say that the more general propo 
sition includes the several more particular ones we must 
recollect what has before been said that these particulars 
form the general truth not by being merely enumerated 
and added together but by being seen in a new light 
no mere verbal recitation of the particulars can decide 
whether the general proposition is true a special act of 
thought is requisite in order to determine how truly each 
is included in the supposed induction in this respect 
the inductive table is not like a mere schedule of 
accounts where the rightness of each part of the reckon 
ing is tested by mere addition of the particulars on the 
contrary the inductive truth is never the mere sum of 
the facts it is made into somethiug more by the intro 
duction of a new mental element and the mind in order 
to be able to supply this element must have peculiar 
endowments and discipline thus looking back at the 
instances noticed in the last article how are we to see 
that a convex surface of the earth is necessarily implied 
by the convergence of meridians towards the north or by 
the visible descent of the north pole of the heavens as we 
travel south manifestly the student in order to see this 
must have clear conceptions of the relations of space

mthev oatumlly inherent in bis mind or established there 
by geometrical cultivation— by studying the properties of 
circles and spheres when he is so prepared he will feel 
the force of the expressions we have used that the facts 
just mentioned are een to be consistent with a globular 
form of the earth but without such aptitude he will not 
see this consistency and if this be so the mere ajssertion 
of it in words will not avail him in satisfying himself of 
the tnith of the proposition 

in like manner in order to perceive the force of the 
copernican induction the student must have his mind so 
disciplined by geometrical studies or otherwise that he 
sees clearly how absolute motion and relative motion 
would alike produce apparent motion he must hve 
learnt to cast away all prejudices arising from the seem 
ing fity of the earth and then he will see that there 
is nothing which stands in the way of the induction while 
there is much which is on its side and in the same 
manner the newtonian induction of the law of the suns 
force from the elliptical form of the orbit will be evi 
dently satisfactory to him only who has such an insight 
into mechanics as to see that a curvilinear path must 
arise from a constantly deflecting force and who is able 
to follow the steps of geometrical reasoning by which 
from the properties of the ellipse newton proves this 
deflection to be in the proportion in which he asserts the 
force to be and thus in all cases the inductive truth 
must indeed be verified by comparing it with the parti 
cular facts but then this comparison is possible for him 
only whose mind is properly disciplined and prepared in 
the use of those conceptions which in addition to the 
facts the act of induction requires 

 in the tables some indication is given at several 
of the steps of the act which the mind must thus per 
form besides the mere conjunction of facts in order to

attain to the inductive truth thus in the cases of the 
newtonian inductions just spoken of the inferences are 
stated to be made by mechanics and in the case of 
the copernican induction it is said that by the nature 
of motion the apparent motion is the same whether the 
heavens or the earth have a diurnal motion and the 
latter is more simple but these verbal statements are 
to be understood as mere hints they cannot supersede 
the necessity of the students contemplating for himself 
the mechanical principles and the nature of motion thus 
referred to 

 in the common or syllogistic logic a certain 
fcyitnula of language is used in stating the reasoning and 
is useful in enabling us more readily to apply the cri 
terion of form to alleged demonstrations this formula 
is the usual syllogism with its members major premiss 
minor premiss and conclusion it may naturally be 
asked whether in inductive logic there is any such for 
mula whether there is any standard form of words in 
which we may most properly express the inference of a 
general truth from particular facts 

at first it might be supposed that the formula of 
inductive logic need only be of this kind these par 
ticulars and all known particulars of the same kind are 
exactly included in the following geneml proposition 
but a moments reflection on what has just been said will 
show us that this is not sufficient for the particulars are 
not merely included in the general proposition it is not 
enough that they appertain to it by enumeration it is 
for instance no adequate example of induction to say 
 mercury describes an elliptical path so does venus so 
do the earth mars jupiter saturn uranus therefore 
all the planets describe elliptical paths this is as we 
have seen the mode of stating the evidence when the 
 in the inductive tables they are marked by an asterisk

the logic of inducmon 

proposition is once suggested but the inductive step 
consists in the suggestion of a conception not before 
apparent when kepler after trying to connect the 
observed places of the planet mars in many other ways 
found at last that the conception of an ellipse would 
include them all he obtained a truth by induction for 
this conclusion was not obviously included in the pheno 
mena and had not been applied to these facts previously 
thus in our formula besides stating that the particulars 
are included in the general proposition we must also 
imply that the generality is constituted by a new concep 
tion — new at least in its application 

hence our inductive formula might be something 
like the following these particulars and all known 
particulars of the same kind are exactly expressed by 
adopting the conceptions and statement of the following 
proposition it is of course requisite that the concep 
tions should be perfectly clear and should precisely 
embsace the facts according to the explanation we have 
already given of those conditions 

 it may happen as we have already stated that 
the explication of a conception by which it acquires its 
due distinctness leads to a definition which definition 
may be taken as the summary and total result of the 
intellectual efforts to which this distinctness is due in 
such cases the formula of induction may be modified 
according to this condition and we may state the infer 
ence by saying after an enumeration and analysis of the 
appropriate facts these facts are completely and dis 
tinctly expressed by adopting the following definition 
and proposition 

this formula has been adopted in stating the induc 
tive propositions which constitute the basis of the science 
of mechanics in a work intitled the mechanical euclid 
the fundamental truths of the subject are expressed in

 consttiitcnidn of seiemcfi 

indudhe pairs of asiiertiond consisting each of ft defini 
tion and a proposition sncli as the following 

def— a uniforvi force is that which acting in the 
direction of the bodys motion adds or subtracts equal 
velocities in equal times 

prop— gravity is a uniform force 

again 

def— two motions are cofnpounded when each pro 
duces its separate effect in a direction parallel to itself 

prop — when any force acts upon a body in motion 
the motion which the force would produce in the body 
at rest is compounded with the previous motion of the 
body 

and in like manner in other cases 

in these cases the proposition is of course established 
and the definition realized by an enumeration of the 
facts and in the case of inferences made in such a form 
the definition of the conception and the assertion of 
the truth are both requisite and are correlative to one 
another each of the two steps contains the verification 
and justification of the other the proposition derives its 
meaning from the definition the definition derives its 
ieality from the proposition if they are separated the 
definition is arbitrary or empty the proposition vague or 
ambiguous 

 but it must be observed that neither of the pre 
ceding formulse expresses the full cogency of the induc 
tive proof they declare only that the results can he 
clearly explained and rigorously deduced by the employ 
ment of a certain definition and a certain proposition 
but in order to make the conclusion demonstmtive which 
in perfect examples of induction it is we ought to be 
able to declare that the results can be clearly explained 
end rigorously declared oniy by the definition and pro 
ksifim which we adopt and in rsality the conviction

of the sound inductive reasoner does reach to this point 
the mathematician asserts the laws of motion seeing 
clearly that they or laws equivalent to them afford the 
only means of clearly expressing and deducing the actual 
fects but this conviction that the inductive inference 
is not only consistent with the facts but necessary finds 
its place in the mind gradually as the contemplation of 
the consequences of the proposition and the various rela 
tions of the facts becomes steady and familiar it is 
scarcely possible for the student at once to satisfy himself 
that the inference is thus inevitable and when he 
arrives at this conviction he sees also in many cases at 
least that there may be other ways of expressing the 
substance of the truth established besides that special 
proposition which he has under his notice 

we may therefore without impropriety renounce the 
undertaking of conveying in our formula this final con 
viction of the necessary truth of our inference we 
may leave it to be thought without insisting upon saying 
it that in such cases what can be true is true but 
if we wish to express the ultimate significance of the 
inductive act of thought we may take as our formula 
for the colligation of facts by induction this — the 
several facts are exactly expressed as one fact if and 
cniy ify we adopt the conception and the assertion of 
the inductive inference 

 i have said that the mind must be properly dis 
eiplined in order that it may see the necessary connexion 
between the fiicts and the general proposition in which 
they are included and the perception of this connexion 
though treated as one step in our inductive inference 
may imply many steps of demonstrative proof the con 
nexion is this that the particular case is included in the 
general one that is may be deduced from it but this 
deduction may often require many links of reasoning

thus in the case of the inference of the law of the fofce 
from the elliptical form of the orbit by newton the proof 
that in the ellipse the deflection from the tangent is 
inversely as the square of the distance from the focus of 
the ellipse is a ratiocination consisting of several steps 
and involving several properties of conic sections these 
properties being supposed to be previously established by 
a geometrical system of demonstration on the special 
subject of the conic sections in this and similar cases 
the induction involves many steps of deduction and 
in such cases although the inductive step the invention 
of the conception is really the most important yet since 
when once made it occupies a familiar place in mens 
minds and since the deductive demonstration is of con 
siderable length and requires intellectual effort to follow 
it at every step men often admire the deductive part of 
the proposition the geometrical or algebraical demonstra 
tion far more than that part in which the philosophical 
merit really resides 

 deductive reasoning is virtually a collection of 
syllogisms as has already been stated and in such rea 
soning the general principles the definitions and axioms 
necessarily stand at the beginning of the demonstration 
in an inductive inference the definitions and principles 
are hlq final restiu of the reasoning the ultimate effect of 
the proof hence when an inductive proposition is to 
be established by a proof involving several steps of 
demonstrative reasoning the enunciation of the proposi 
tion will contain explicitly or implicitly principles which 
the demonstration proceeds upon as axioms but which 
are really inductive inferences thus in order to prove 
that the force which retains a planet in an ellipse varies 
inversely as the square of the distance it is taken for 
granted that the laws of motion are true and that 
they apply to the planets yet the doctrine that this 



digitized by vjooq ic 



the logic op induction 

is so as well as the law of the force were established 
only by this and the like demonstrations the doctrine 
which is the hypothesis of the deductive reasoning 
is the inference of the inductive process the special 
fiicts which are the basis of the inductive inference are 
the conclusion of the train of deduction and in this 
manner the deduction establishes the induction the 
principle which we gather from the facts is true because 
the facts can be derived from it by rigorous demonstra 
tion induction moves upwards and deduction down 
wards on the same stair 

but still there is a great difference in the character 
of their movements deduction descends steadily and 
methodically step by step induction mounts by a leap 
which is out of the reach of method she bounds to the 
top of the stair at once and then it is the business of 
deduction by trying each step in order to establish the 
solidity of her companions footing yet these must be 
processes of the same mind the inductive intellect 
makes an assertion which is subsequently justified by 
demonstration and it shows its sagacity its peculiar 
character by enunciating the proposition when as yet the 
demonstration does not exist but then it shows that it is 
sagacity by also producing the demonstration 

it has been said that inductive and deductive reason 
ing are contrary in their scheme that in deduction we 
infer particular from general truths while in induction 
if e infer general from particular that deduction consists 
of many steps in each of which we apply known general 
propositions in particular cases while in induction we have 
a single step in which we pass from many particular truths 
to one general proposition and this is truly said but 
though contrary in their motions the two are the operation 
of the same mind travelling over the same ground de 
duction is a necessary part of induction deduction

justifies by calculation what induction had happily guessed 
induction recognizes the ore of truth by its weight 
deduction confirms tho recognition by chemical analysis 
every step of induction must be confirmed by rigorous 
deductive reasoning followed into such detail as the nature 
and complexity of the relations whether of quantity or 
any other render requisite if not so justified by the 
supposed discoverer it is not induction 

 such tabular arrangements of propositions as we 
have constructed may be considered as the criterion of 
truth for the doctrines which they include they are 
the criterion of inductive truth in the same sense in 
which syllogistic demonstration is the criterion of 
necessary truth — of the certainty of conclusions de 
pending upon evident first principles and that such 
tables are really a criterion of the truth of the proposi 
tions which they contain will be plain by examining 
their structure for if the connexion which the induc 
tive process assumes be ascertained to be in each case 
real and true the assertion of the general proposition 
merely collects together ascertained truths and in like 
manner each of those more particular propositions is true 
because it merely expresses collectively more special 
facts so that the most general theory is only the asser 
tion of a great body of facts duly classified and subordi 
nated when we assert the truth of the copernican 
theory of the motions of the solar system or of the new 
tonian theory of the forces by which they are caused we 
merely assert the groups of propositions which in the 
table of astronomical induction are included in these 
doctrines and ultimately we may consider ourselves as 
merely asserting at once so many facts and therefore of 
course expressing an indisputable truth 

 at any one of these steps of induction in the 
table the inductive proposition is a tieoy with regard

to the facts which it includes while it is to be looked 
upon as a fact with respect to the higher generalizations 
in which it is included in any other sense as was 
formerly shown the opposition of fact and theory is 
untenable and leads to endless perplexity and debate 
is it a fact or a theory that the planet mars revolves in 
au ellipse about the sun to kepler employed in 
endeavouring to combine the separate observations by the 
conception of an ellipse it is a theory to newton 
engaged in inferring the law of force from a knowledge 
of the elliptical motion it is a fact there are as we 
have already seen no special attributes of theory and 
fact which distinguish them from one another facts 
are phenomena apprehended by the aid of conceptions 
and mental acts as theories also are we commonly 
call our observations facts when we apply without effort 
or consciousness conceptions perfectly familiar to us 
while we speak of theories when we have previously 
contemplated the facts and the connecting conception 
separately and have made the connexion by a conscious 
mental act the real difference is a difference of relation 
as the same proposition in a demonstration is the premiss 
of one syllogism and the condicsion in another — as the 
same person is a father and a son propositions are facts 
and theories according as they stand above or below the 
inductive brackets of our tables 

 to obviate mistakes i may remark that the terms 
higher and lowers when used of generalizations are un 
avoidably represented by their opposites in our inductive 
tables the highest generalization is that which includes 
all others and this stands the lowest on our page because 
reading downwards that is the place which we last reach 

there is a distinction of the knowledge acquired by 
scientific induction into two kinds which is so important 
that we shall consider it in the succeeding chapter

of laws of phenomena and of causes 

 in the first attempts at acquiring an exact and 
connected knowledge of the appearances and operations 
which nature presents men went no further than to leam 
tffkat takes place not whjf it occurs they discovered an 
order which the phenomena follow rules which they 
obey but they did not come in sight of the powers by 
which these rules are determined the causes of which 
this order is the eflfect thus for example they found 
that many of the celestial motions took place as if the 
sun and stars were carried round by the revolutions of 
certain celestial spheres but what causes kept these 
spheres in constant motion they were never able to 
explain in like manner in modern times kepler dis 
covered that the planets describe ellipses before new 
ton explained why they select this particular curve and 
describe it in a particular manner the laws of reflection 
refraction dispersion and other properties of light have 
long been known the causes of these laws are at present 
under discussion and the same might be said of many 
other sciences the discovery of laws of phenomena 
is in all cases the first step in exact knowledge these 
laws may often for a long period constitute the whole of 
our science and it is always a matter requiring great 
talents and great efforts to advance to a knowledge of 
the causes of the phenomena 

hence the larger part of our knowledge of nature at 
least of the certain portion of it consists of the know 
ledge of the laws of phenomena in astronomy indeed 
besides knowing the rules which guide the appearances 
and resolving them into the real motions from which they 
arise we can refer these motions to the forces which pro

duce them in optics we have become acquainted with 
a vast number of laws by which varied and beautiful 
phenomia are governed and paiiaps we may assume 
since the evidence of the undulatory theory has been so 
fully developed that we know also the causes of the 
phenomena but in a large class of sciences while we 
have learnt many laws of phenomena the causes by 
which these are produced are still unknown or disputed 
are we to ascribe to the operation of a fluid or fluids 
and if so in what manner the tncts of heat magnetism 
electricity galvanism what are the forces by which 
the elements of chemical compounds are held together 
what are the forces of a higher order as we cannot help 
believing by which the course of vital action in organized 
bodies is kept up in these and other cases we have 
extensive departments of science but we are as yet 
unable to trace the effects to their causes and our 
science so far as it is positive and certain consists 
entirely of the laws of phenomena 

 in those cases in which we have a division of the 
science which teaches us the doctrine of the causes as 
well as one which states the rules which the eflts fol 
low i have distinguished the two portions of the science 
by certain terms i have thus spoken of formal astro 
nomy and physical astronomy the latter phrase has long 
been commonly employed to describe that department 
of astronomy which deals with those forces by which the 
heavenly bodies are guided in their motions the former 
adjective appears well suited to describe a collection of 
rules depending on those ideas of space time position 
number which are as we have already said ihe forms of 
our apprehension of phenomena the laws of phenomena 
may be considered as formulcdy expressing results in 
terms of those ideas in like manner i have spoken of 
formal optics and physical optics the latter division

including all speculations concerning the machinery by 
which the effects are produced formal acoustics and 
physical acoustics may be distinguished in like manner 
although these two portions of science haye been a good 
deal mixed together by most of those who have treated 
of them formal thermotics the knowledge of the laws 
of the phenomena of heat ought in like manner to lead 
to physical thermotics or the theory of heat with 
reference to the mode in which its effects are produced 
—a branch of science which as yet can hardly be said to 
exist 

 what kind of cause are we to admit in science 
this is an important and by no means an easy question 
in order to answer it we must consider in what manner 
our progress in the knowledge of causes has hitherto been 
mude by far the most conspicuous instance of success 
in such researches is the discovery of the causes of the 
motions of the heavenly bodies in this case after the 
formal laws of the motions — their conditions as to space 
and time— had become known men were enabled to go 
a step further to reduce them to the familiar and general 
cause of motion — mechanical force and to determine 
the laws which this force follows that this was a step 
in addition to the knowledge previously possessed and 
that it was a real and peculiar truth will not be contested 
and a step in any other subject which should be analo 
gous to this in astronomy — a discovery of causes and 
forces as certain and clear as the discovery of universal 
gravitation — would undoubtedly be a vast advance 
upon a body of science consisting only of the laws of 
phenomena 

 but althongh physical astronomy may well be 
taken as a standard in estimating the value and magni 
tude of the advance from the knowledge of phenomena 
to the knowledge of causes the peculiar features of the 



digitized by vjooq ic 



laws of phenomena and of causes 

transition from formal to physical science in that subject 
must not be allowed to limit too narrowly our views of 
the nature of this transition in other cases we are not 
for example to consider that the step which leads us to 
the knowledge of causes in any province of nature must 
necessarily consist in the discovery of centres of forces 
and collections of such centres by which the effects are 
produced the discovery of the causes of phenomena 
may imply the detection of a fluid by whose undulations 
or other operations the results are occasioned the phe 
nomena of acoustics are we know produced in this 
manner by the air and in the cases of light heat mag 
netism and others even if we reject all the theories of 
such fluids which have hitherto been proposed we still 
cannot deny that such theories are intelligible and pos 
sible as the discussions concerning them have shown 
nor can it be doubted that if the assumption of such 
a fluid in any case were as well evidenced as the doctrine 
of universal gravitation is it must be considered as a 
highly valuable theory 

 but again not only must we in aiming at the 
formation of a causal section in each science of pheno 
mena consider fluids and their various modes of operation 
admissible as well as centres of mechanical force but 
we must be prepared if it be necessary to consider the 
forces or powers to which we refer the phenomena under 
still more general aspects and invested with characters 
different from mere mechanical force for example the 
forces by which the chemical elements of bodies are 
bound together and from which arise both their sensible 
texture their crystalline form and their chemical compo 
sition are certainly forces of a very different nature from 
the mere attraction of matter according to its mass the 
powers of assimilation and reproduction in plants and 
animals are obviously still more removed from mere

 construction of science 

mechanism yet these powers are not on that account 
less real nor a less fit and worthy subject of scientific 
inquiry 

 in fact these forces — mechanical chemical and 
vital — as we advance from one to the other each bring 
into our consideration new characters and what these 
characters are has appeared in the survey which we have 
made of the fundamental ideas of the various sciences 
it was then shown that the forces by which chemical 
effects are produced necessarily involve the idea of 
polarity — they are polar forces the particles tend 
together in virtue of opposite properties which in the 
combination neutralize each other hence in attempiug 
to advance to a theory of causes in chemistry our task is 
by no means to invent laws of mechanical force and col 
lections of forces by which the effects may be produced 
we know beforehand that no such attempt can succeed 
our aim must be to conceive such new kinds of force 
including polarity among their characters as may best 
render the results intelligible 

 thus in advancing to a science of cause in 
any subject the labour and the struggle is not to ana 
lyse the phenomena according to any preconceived and 
already familiar ideas but to form distinctly new concep 
tions such as do really carry us to a more intimate view 
of the processes of nature thus in the case of astro 
nomy the obstacle which deferred the discovery of the 
true causes from the time of kepler to that of newton 
was the difficulty of taking hold of mechanical concep 
tions and axioms with suflbcient clearness and steadiness 
which during the whole of that interval mathematicians 
were learning to do in the question of causation which 
now lies most immediately in the path of science that of 
the causes of electrical and chemical phenomena the 
business of rightly fixing and limiting the conception of 



digitized by vjooq ic 



laws of phenomena and of causes 

polarity is the proper object of the efforts of discoverers 
accordingly a large portion of mr faradays recent 
labours is directed not to the attempt at discovering 
new laws of phenomena but to the task of throwing light 
upon the conception of polarity and of showing how it 
must be understood so that it shall include electrical 
induction and other phenomena which have commonly 
been ascribed to forces acting mechanically at a distance 
he is by no means content nor would it answer the ends 
of science that he should be with stating the results of 
his experiments he is constantly in every page pointing 
out the interpretation of his experiments and showing 
how the conception of polar forces enters into this inter 
pretation i shall he saysf use every opportunity 
which presents itself of returning to that strong test of 
truth experiment but he adds i shall necessarily 
have occasion to speak theoretically and even hypothe 
tically his hypothesis that electrical inductive action 
always takes place by means of a continuous line of 
polarized particles and not by attraction and repulsion 
at a distance if established cannot fail to be a great step 
on our way towards a knowledge of causes as well as 
phenomena in the subjects under his consideration 

 the process of obtaining new conceptions is to 
most minds far more unwelcome than luiy labour in em 
jiloying old ideas the effort is indeed painful and 
oppressive it is feeling in the dark for an object which 
we cannot find hence it is not surprising that we 
should far more willingly proceed to seek for new causes 
by applying conceptions borrowed from old ones men 
were familiar with solid frames and with whirlpools of 
fluid when they had not learnt to form any clear con

ception of attraction at a distance hence they at first 
imagined the heavenly motions to be caused by crystalline 
spheres and vortices at length they were taught to 
conceive central forces and then they reduced the solar 
system to these but having done this they fancied that 
all the rest of the machinery of nature must be central 
forces we find newton expressing this conviction 
and the mathematicians of the last centuiy acted upon it 
very extensively we may especially remark laplaces 
labours in this field having explained by such forces 
the phenomena of capillary attraction he attempted to 
apply the same kind of explanation to the reflection 
refraction and double refraction of light — to the con 
stitution of gases — the operation of heat it was soon 
seen that the explanation of refraction was arbitrary and 
that of double refraction illusory while polarization 
entirely eluded the grasp of this machinery centres of 
force would no longer represent the modes of causation 
which belonged to the phenomena polarization required 
some other contrivance such as the undulatory theory 
supplied no theory of light can be of any avail in which 
the fundamental idea of polarity is not clearly exhibited 
 tlie sciences of magnetism and electricity have 
given rise to theories in which this relation of polarity is 
exhibited by means of two opposite fluids f — a positive 
and a negative fluid or a vitreous and a resinous for elec 
tricity and a boreal and an austral fluid for magnetism 
the hypothesis of such fluids gives results agreeing in a 
remarkable manner with the facts and their measures as 
coulomb and others have shown it may be asked how 
far we may in such a case suppose that we have dis 
covered the true cause of the phenomena and whether it 
is sufficiently proved that these fluids really exist the

right answer seems to be that the hypothesis certainly 
represents the truth so far as regards the polar relation 
of the two energies and the laws of the attractive and 
repulsive forces of the particles in which these energies 
reside bnt that we are not entitled to assume that the 
vehicles of these energies possess other attributes of ma 
terial fluids or that the forces thus ascribed to the parti 
cles are the primary elementary forces from which the 
action originates we are the more bound to place this 
cautious limit to our acceptance of the coulombian theory 
since in electricity faraday has in vain endeavoured to 
bring into view one of the polar fluids without the other 
whereas such a result ought to be possible if there were 
two separable fluids the impossibility of this separate 
exhibition of one fluid appears to show that the fluids are 
real only so fiir as they are polar and faradays view 
above mentioned according to which the attractions at a 
distance are resolved into the action of lines of polarized 
particles of air appears still further to show that the con 
ceptions hitherto entertained of electrical forces accord 
ing to the coulombian theory do not penetrate to the 
real and intimate nature of the causation belonging to 
this case 

 since it is thus difficult to know when we have 
seized the true cause of the phenomena in any depart 
ment of science it may appear to some persons that 
physical inquirers are imprudent and unphilosophical in 
undertaking this research of causes and that it would 
be safer and wiser to confine ourselves to the investigation 
of the laws of phenomena in which field the knowledge 
which we obtain is definite and certain hence there 
have not been wanting those who have laid it down as a 
maxim that science inust study only the laws of phe 
nomena and never the mode of production but it is 

 comte philosophic positive

easy to see that such a maxim would confine the breadth 
and depth of scientific inquiries to a most scanty and 
miserable limit indeed such a rule would defeat its 
own object for the laws of phenomena in many cases 
cannot be even expressed or understood withotit some 
hjrpothesis respecting their mode of production how 
could the phenomena of polarization have been conceived 
or reasoned upon except by imagining a polar arrange 
ment of particles or transverse vibrations or some equi 
valent hypothesis the doctrines of fits of easy trans 
mission the doctrine of moveable polarization and the like 
even when erroneous as representing the whole of the 
phenomena were still useful in combining some of them 
into laws and without some such hypotheses the facts could 
not have been followed out the doctrine of a fluid caloric 
may be false but without imagining such a fluid how 
could the movement of heat from one part of a body to 
another be conceived it may be replied that fourier 
laplace poisson who have principally cultivated the 
theory of heat have not conceived it as a fluid but 
have referred conduction to the radiation of the mole 
cules of bodies which they suppose to be separate points 
but this molecular constitution of bodies is itself an 
assumption of the mode in which the phenomena are 
produced and the radiation of heat suggests inquiries 
concerning a fluid emanation no less than its conduction 
does in like manner the attempts to connect the laws 
of phenomena of heat and of gases have led to hypo 
theses respecting the constitution of gases and the com 
bination of their particles with those of caloric which 
hypotheses may be false but are probably the best means 
of discovering the truth 

to debar science from inquiries like these on the 
ground that it is her business to inquire into facts and 
not to speculate about causes is a curious example of 



digitized by vjooq ic 



laws op phenomena and of causes 

tbat barren caution which hopes for truth without daring 
to venture upon the quest of it this temper would 
have stopped with keplers discoveries and would have 
refused to go on with newton to inquire into the mode 
in which the phenomena are produced it would have 
stopped with newtons optical facts and would have 
refused to go on with him and his successors to inquire 
into the mode in which these phenomena are produced 
and as we have abundantly shown it would on that 
very account have failed in seeing what the phenomena 
really are 

in many subjects the attempt to study the laws of 
phenomena independently of any speculations respecting 
the causes which have produced them is neither possible 
for human intelligence nor for human temper men 
cannot contemplate the phenomena without clothing them 
in terms of some hypothesis and will not be schooled to 
suppress the questionings which at every moment rise up 
within them concerning the causes of the phenomena 
who can attend to the appearances which come under 
the notice of the geologist — strata regularly bedded full 
of the remains of animals such as now live in the depths 
of the ocean raised to the tops of mountains broken 
contorted mixed with rocks such as still flow from the 
mouths of volcanos — who can see phenomena like these 
and imagine that he best promotes the progress of our 
knowledge of the earths history by noting down the 
facts and abstaining from all inquiry whether these are 
really proofe of past states of the earth and of subterraneous 
forces or merely an accidental imitation of the effects of 
such causes in this and similar cases to proscribe the 
inquiry into causes would be to annihilate the science 

finally this caution does not even gain its own single 
comi the escape from hypotheses for as we have said 
those who will not seek for new and appropriate causes

of newlystudied phenomeiia are almost inevitably led 
to ascribe the facts to modifications of causes already 
familiar they may declare that they will not hear of 
such causes as vital powers elective affinities electric or 
calorific or luminiferous ethers or fluids but they will not 
the less on that account assume hypotheses equally un 
authorized for instance — universal mechanical forces a 
molecular constitution of bodies solid hard inert mat 
ter — and will apply these hypotheses in a manner which is 
arbitrary in itself as well as quite insufficient for its purpose 

 it appears then to be required both by the 
analogy of the most successful efforts of science in past 
times and by the irrepressible speculative powers of the 
hutnan mind that we should attempt to discover both 
the laws of phenotnena and their catises in every 
department of science when prosecuted fur enough these 
two great steps of investigation must succeed each other 
the laws of phenomena must be known before we can 
speculate concerning causes the causes must be inquired 
into when the phenomena have been reduced to rule 
in both these speculations the suppositions and concep 
tions which occur must be constantly tested by reference 
to observation and experiment in both we must as fur 
as possible devise hypotheses which when we thus test 
them display those characters of truth of which we have 
already spoken — an agreement with facts such as will 
stand the most patient and rigid inquiry a provision for 
predicting truly the results of untried cases a consilience 
of inductions from various classes of facts and a pro 
gressive tendency of the scheme to simplicity and unity 

 we shall attempt hereafter to give several rules 
of a more precise and detailed kind for the discovery 
of the causes and still more of the laws of phe 
nomena but it will be useful in the first place to point 
out the classification of the sciences which results from

the principles already established in this work and 
for this purpose we must previously decide the question 
whether the practical art as medicine and engineering 
must be included in our list of sciences 



chapter viii 
of art and science 



 the distinction of arts and sciences very mate 
rially affects all classifications of the departments of hu 
man knowledge it is often maintainedi expressly or 
tacitly that the arts are a part of our knowledge in the 
same sense in which the sciences are so and that art 
is the application of science to the purposes of practical 
life it will be found that these views require some 
correction when we understand science in the exact sense 
in which we have throughout endeavoured to contemplate 
it and in which alone our examination of its nature can 
instruct us in the true foundations of our knowledge 

when we cast our ejes upon the early stages of the 
histories of nations we cannot fail to be struck with the 
consideration that in many countries the arts of life 
already appear at least in some inide form or other 
when as yet nothing of science exists a practical 
knowledge of astronomy such as enables them to reckon 
months and years is found among all nations except the 
mere savages a practical knowledge of mechanics must 
have existed in those nations which have left us the 
gigantic monuments of early architecture the pyramids 
and temples of egypt and nubia the cyclopean walls 
of italy and greece the temples of magna grsecia and 
sicily the obelisks and edifices of india the cromlechs 
and druidical circles of countries formerly celtic— must

 construction of science 

have demanded no small praetical mechanical skill and 
power yet those modes of reckoning time must have 
preceded the rise of speculative astronomy these struc 
tures must have been erected before the theory of me 
chanics was known to suppose as some have done 
a great body of science now lost to have existed in the 
remote ages to which these remains belong is not only 
quite gratuitous and contrary to all analogy but is a 
supposition which cannot be extended so far as to expln 
all such cases for it is impossible to imane thst every 
art has been preceded by the science which renders a 
reason for its processes certainly men formed wine from 
the grape before they possessed a science of fermentation 
the first instructor of every artificer in brass and iron 
can hardly be supposed to have taught the chemistry of 
metals as a science the inventor of the square and the 
compasses had probably no more knowledge of demon 
strated geometry than have the artisans who now use those 
implements and finally the use of speech the employment 
of the inflections and combinations of words must needs 
be assumed as having been prior to any general view of the 
nature and analogy of language even at this moment 
the greater part of the arts which exist in the world are not 
accompanied by the sciences on which they theoretically 
depend who shall state to us the general chemical truths 
to which the manufactures of glass and porcelain and iron 
and brass owe their existence do not almost all arti 
sans practise many successful artifices long before science 
expldns the gmnd of the process do not arts at this 
day exist in a high state of perfection in countries in 
which there is no science as china and india these 
countries and many others have no theories of mecha 
nics of optics of chemistry of physiology yet they 
construct and use mechanical and optical instruments 
make chemical combinations take advantage of physios

logical laws it is too evident to need farther illustra 
tion that art may exist without science — that it has 
usually been anterior to it and even now commonly ad 
vances independently leaving science to follow as it can 
 we here mean by science that exact general 
speculative knowledge of which we have throughout 
this work been endeavouring to exhibit the nature and 
rules between such science and the practical arts of 
life the points of difference are sufficiently manifest 
the object of science is knowledge the object of art 
are works the latter is satisfied with producing its 
material results to the former the operations of matter 
whether natural or artificial are interesting only so far as 
they can be embraced by intelligible principles the 
end of art is the beginning of science for when it is 
seen what is done then comes the question why it is done 
art may have fixed general rules stated in words but 
she has these merely as means to an end to science 
the propositions which she obtains are each in itself a 
sufficient end of the effort by which it is acquired when 
art has brought forth her product her task is finished 
science is constantly led by one step of her path to 
another each proposition which she obtains impels her 
to go onwards to other propositions more general more 
profound more simple art puts elements together 
vnthout caring to know what they are or why they 
coalesce science analyses the compound and at every 
such step strives not only to perform but to understand 
the analysis art advances in proportion as she becomes 
able to bring forth products more multiplied more 
complex more various but science straining her eyes to 
penetrate more and more deeply into the nature of thing 
reckons her success in proportion as she sees in all the 
phenomena however multiplied complex and varied the 
results of one or two simple and general laws

 there are many acts which man as well as animals 
performs by the guidance of nature without seeing or 
seeking the reason why he does so as the acts by which 
he balances himself in standing or moving and those by 
which he judges of the form and position of the objects 
around him these actions have their reason in the 
principles of geometry and mechanics but of such rea 
sons he who thus acts is unaware he works blindly 
under the impulse of an unknown principle which we call 
instinct when mans speculative nature seeks and finds 
the reasoiis why he should act thus or thus — why he 
ihould stretch out his arm to prevent his falling or 
assign a certain position to an object in consequence of 
the angles under which it is seen — he may perform the 
same actions as before but they are then done by the aid 
of a different faculty which for the sake of distinction we 
may call insight instinct is a purely active principle it is 
seen in deeds alone it has no power of looking inwards 
it asks no questions it has no tendency to discover 
reasons or rules it is the opposite of insight 

 art is not identical with instinct on the contrary 
there are broad differences instinct is stationary art 
is progressive instinct is mute it acts but gives no 
rules for acting art can speak she can lay down rules 
but though art is thus separate from instinct she is not 
essentially combined with insight she cani see what to 
do but she needs not to see why it is done she may 
lay down rules but it is not her business to give reasons 
when man makes that his employment he enters upon 
the domain of science art takes the phenomena and 
laws of nature as she finds them that they are multiplied 
complex capricious incoherent disturbs her not she is 
content that the rules of natures operations should be 
perfectly arbitrary and unintelligible provided they are 
constant so that she can depend upon their effects but

op art and science 

science is impatient of all appearance of caprice incon 
sistency irregxilaritj in nature she will not bdievft in 
the existence of such characters she resolves one appa 
rent anomaly after another her task is not ended till 
every thing is so plain and simple that she is tempted to 
believe she sees tt it could by no possibility have been 
otherwise than it is 

 it may be sdd that after all art does really 
involve the knowledge which science delivers — that the 
artisan who raises large weights practically knows the 
properties of the mechanical powers — that he who 
manufactures chemicid compounds is virtually acquainted 
with the laws of chemical combination to this we reply 
that it might on the same grounds be asserted that he 
who acts upon the principle that two sidei of a triangle 
are greater than the third is really acquainted with geo 
metry and that he who balances himself on one fbot 
knows the properties of the centre of gravity but this 
is an acquaintance with geometry and mechanics which 
even brute animals possess it is evident that it is not 
of such knowledge as this that we have here to treat 
it is plain that this mode of possessing principles is alto 
gether different fixm that contemplation of them ofi which 
science is founded we neglect tjie most easential and 
manifest differences if we confound our unconscious 
assumptions with our demonstrative reasonings 

 the real state of the case is that the principles 
which art involves science alone evolves tite truths on 
which the success of art depends lurk in the artists 
mind in an undeveloped state guiding his hand stimu 
lating his invention balancing his judgment but not 
ipearing in the form of enunciated propositionfii prin

he can nowhere directly contemplate that the creative 
and directive principles which have thei r lodgment in the 
artists mind when unfolded by our speculative powers 
into cgrstnatic shape become science is true but it is 
predsely this process of development which gives to 
them their character of science in practical art prin 
ciples are unseen guides leading us by invisible strings 
through paths where the end alone is looked at it 
is for science to direct and purge our vision so that 
these airy ties these principles and laws generalizations 
and theories become distinct objects of vision many 
may feel the intellectual monitor but it is only to he 
fieivourite heroes that the goddess of wisdom visibly 
reveals herself 

 thus art in its earlier stages at least is widely 
different from science independent of it and anterior to 
it at a later period no doubt art may borrow aid 
fhm science and the discoveries of the philosopher 
may be of great value to the manufacturer and the artist 
but even then this application forms no essential part of 
the science the interest which belongs to it is not an 
intellectual interest the augmentation of human 
power and convenience may impel or reward the physical 
philosopher but the processes by which mans repasts 
are rendered more delicious his journeys more rapid his 
weapons more terrible are not therefore science they 
may involve principles which are of the highest interest 
to science but as the advantage is not practically more 
precious because it results from a beautiful theory so the 
theoretical principle has no more conspicuous place in 
science because it leads to convenient practical conse 
quences the nature of science is purely intellectual

same kind the merely empirical maxims of art without 
introducing endless confusion into the subject and 
making it impossible to attain any solid footing in our 
philosophy 

 i shall therefore not place in our classification of 
the sciences the arts as has generally been done nor 
shall i notice the applications of sciences to art as 
forming any separate portion of each science the 
sciences considered as bodies of general speculative 
truths are what we are here concerned with and appli 
cations of such truths whether useful or useless are 
important to us only as illustrations and examples 
whatever place in human knowledge the practical arts 
may hold they are not sciences and it is only by this 
rigorous separation of the practical from the theoretical 
that we can arrive at any solid conclusions respecting the 
nature of truth and the mode of arriving at it such as it 
is our object to attain 



chapter ix 
of the classification of sciences 

 the classification of sciences has its chief use in 
pointing out to us the extent of our powers of arriving at 
truth and the analogies which may obtain between those 
certain and lucid portions of knowledge with which we 
are here concerned and those other portions of a very 
ditferent interest and evidence which we here purposely 
abstain to touch upon the classification of human 
knowledge will therefore have a more peculiar import 
ance when we can include in it the moral political and 
metaphysical as well as the physical portions of our 
knowledge but such a survey does not belong to our

presetit uudertaking and a general view of the con 
neicion and order of the branches of sciences which our 
review has hithertp included will even now possess some 
interest and may serve hereafter as an introduction to a 
more complete scheme of the general body of human 
knowledge 

 in this as in any other case a sound classification 
must be the result not of any assumed principles impe 
ratively applied to the subject but of an examination of 
the objects to be classified — of an analysis of them 
into the principles in which they agree and differ the 
classification of sciences must result from the considerar 
tioq of their nature and contents accordingly that 
review of the sciences in which the history of them 
engaged us led to a classification of which the main 
features are indicated in that work the classification 
thus obtained depends neither upon the faculties of th 
mind to which the separate parts of our knowledge owe 
their origin nor upon the objects which each science 
contemplates but upon a more natural and fiindamental 
element — namely the ideas which each science involves 
the ideas regulate and connect the lacts and are the 
foundations of the reasoning in each science and having 
in the present work more ftilly examined these ideas we 
are now prepared to state here the classification to which 
they lead if we have rightly traced each science to the 
conceptions which are really fundamental with regtml to 
it and which give rise to the first principles on which it 
depends it is not necessary for our purpose that we 
should decide whether these conceptions are absolutely 
ailtimate principles of thought or whether on the con 
trary they can be further resolved into other funda 
montai ideas we need not now suppose it determined 
wlethpr or not number is a mere modification of the 
jd of time and force a mere modification of the idea 



digitized by vjooq ic 



classification of sciences 

of cause for however this may be our conception of 
number is the foundation of arithmetic and our concep 
tion of force is the foundation of mechanics it is to 
be observed also that in our classification each science 
may involve not only the ideas or conceptions which are 
placed opposite to it in the list but also all whidi precede 
it thus formal astronomy involves not only the con 
ception of motion but also those which are the founda 
tion of arithmetic and geometry in like manner 
physical astronomy employs the sciences of statics and 
dynamics and thus rests on their foundations and they 
in turn depend upon the ideas of space and of time as 
well as of cause 

 we may further observe that this arrangement of 
sciences according to the fundamental ideas which they 
involve points out the transition from those parts of 
human knowledge which have been included in our 
histoiy and philosophy to other regions of speculation 
into which we have not entered we have repeatedly 
found ourselves upon the borders of inquiries of a psycho 
logical or moral or theological nature thus the history 
of physiology led us to the consideration of life sen 
sation and volition and at these ideas we stopped that 
we might not transgress the boundaries of our subject as 
then predetermined it is plain that the pursuit of 
such conceptions and tbeir consequences would lead us 
to the sciences if we are allowed to call them sciences 
which contemplate not only ariinial but human princi 
ples of action to anthropology and psychology in 
otifaer ways too the ideas which we have examined 
although manifestly the foundations of sciences siicfa as 
we have here treated of also plainly pointed to specula 
tions of a different order thus the idea of a final cause 
is an indispensable guide in biology as we have seen

but the conception of design as directing the order fof 
nature once admitted soon carries us to higher conteia 
plations again the class of palaetiological sciences 
which we were in the history led to construct although 
we there admitted onlj one example of the class namely 
geology does in reality include many vast lines of 
research as the history and causes of the diffusion of 
plants and animals the history of languages arts and 
consequently of civilization along with these researches 
comes the question how far these histories point back 
wards to a natural or a supernatural origin and the idea 
of a first cause is thus brought under our consideration 
finally it is not difficult to see that as the physical 
sciences have their peculiar governing ideas which sup 
port and shape them so the moral and political sciences 
also must similarly have their fundamental and formative 
ideas the source of universal and certain truths each of 
their proper kind but to follow out the traces of this 
analogy and to verify the existence of those fundamental 
ideas in morals and politics is a task quite out of the 
sphere of the work in which we are here engaged 

 we may now place before the reader our classifica 
tion of the sciences adding in the list a few not belong 
ing to our present subject that the nature of the transi 
tion by which we are to extepd our philosophy into 
a wider and higher region may be in some measure 
perceived 

we may observe that the term physics when confined 
to a peculiar class of sciences is usually understood to 
exclude the mechanical sciences on the one side and 
chemistry on the other and thus embraces the secondary 
mechanical and analyticomechanical sciences but 
the adjective physical applied to any science and opposed 
to formal as in astronomy and optics implies those 
speculations in which we consider not only the laws of

review of opinions on the nature of 

knowledge and the methods 

of seeking it 



chapter l 
introduction 



br the examination of the elements of human thought 
in which we have been engaged and by a consideration 
of the history of the most clear and certain parts of our 
knowledge we have ben led to certain doctrines respect 
ing the progress of that exact and systematic knowledge 
which we call science and these doctrines we have 
endeavoured to lay before the reader in the preceding 
ook the questions on which we have thus ventured 
to pronounce have had a strong interest for man from 
the eariiet period of his intellectual progress and have 
been the subjts of lively discussion and bold speculation 
in every age we conceive that in the doctrines to 
which our researches have conducted us we have a far 
better hope that we possess a body of permanent truths 
than the earlier essays on the same subjects could furnish 
for we have not taken our examples of knowledge at 
hazard as earlier speculators did and were almost com 
pelled to do but have drawn our materiak from the vast 
store of unquestioned truths which modem science offers 
to us and we have formed our judgment concerning the 
nature and progreis of knowledge by considering what 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 eeview of opinions on knowledge 

such science is and how it has reached its present condi 
tion but though we have thus pursued our speculations 
concerning knowledge with advantages which earlier 
writers did not possess it is still both interesting and 
instructive for us to regard the opinions upon this subject 
which have been delivered by the philosophers of past 
times it is especially interesting to see some of the 
truths which we have endeavoured to expound gradually 
dawning in mens minds and assuming the clear and 
permanent form in which we can now contemplate them 
i shall therefore in this book pass in review many of the 
opinions of the writers of various ages concerning the 
mode by which man best acquires the truest knowledge 
and i shall endeavour as we proceed to appreciate the 
real value of such judgments and their place in the pro 
gress of sound philosophy 

in this estimate of the opinions of others i shall 
be guided by those general doctrines which i have as i 
trust established in the preceding part of this work 
and without attempting here to give any summary of 
these doctrines i may remark that there are two main 
principles by which speculations on such subjects in ajl 
ages are connected and related to each other namely 
the opposition of ideas bui sematmis and the distinction 
of practical and speculative knowledge the opposition 
of ideas and sensations is exhibited to us in the antithe 
sis of theory and fact which are necessarily considered 
as distinct and of opposite natures and yet necessarily 
identical and constituting science by their identity in 
like manner although practical knowledge is in substance 
identical with speculative for all knowledge is specula 
tion there is a distinction between the two in their 
history and in the subjects by which they are exemplified 
which distinction is quite essential in judging of the phi 
losophical views of the ancients the alternatives of 



digitized by vjooq ic 



inteopuction 

identity and diversity in these two antitheses the succes 
sive separation opposition and reunion of principles which 
thus arise have produced as they may easily be imagined 
capable of doing a long and varied series of systems 
concerning the nature of knowledge among which we 
shall have to guide our course by the aid of the views 
already presented 

i am far from undertaking or wishing to review the 
whole series of opinions which thus comes under our 
view and i do not even attempt to examine all the 
principal authors who have written on such subjects i 
merely wish to select some of the most considerable 
forms which such opinions have assumed and to point 
out in some measure the progress of truth from age to 
age in doing this i can only endeavour to seize some 
of the most prominent features of each time and of each 
step and i must pass rapidly from classical antiquity to 
those which we have called the dark ages and from them 
to modem times at each of these periods the modifi

plato 

there would be small advantage in beginning our 
examination eariier than the period of the socratic 
school at athens for although the spirit of inquiry on 
such subjects had awoke in greece at an eariier period 
and although the peculiar aptitude of the grecian mind 
for such researches had shown itself repeatedly in subtle 
distinctions and acute reasonings all the positive results of 
these early efforts were contained in a more definite form 
in the reasonings of the platonic age anterior to that 
time the greeks did not possess plain and familiar exam 
ples of exact knowledge such as the truths of arithmetic 
geometry astronomy and optics became in the school 
of plato nor were the antitheses of which we spoke 
above so distinctly and fully unfolded as we find them in 
platos works 

the question which hinges upon one of these anti 
theses occupies a prominent place in several of the 
platonic dialogues — namely whether our knowledge be 
obtained by means of sensation or of ideas one of the 
doctrines which plato most earnestly inculcated upon his 
countrymen was that we do not know cohoeming sensible 
objects but concerning ideas the first attempts of the 
greeks at metaphysical analysis had given rise to a school 
which maintained that material objects are the only 
realities in opposition to this arose another school 



digitized by vjooq ic 



plato 

which taught that material objects have no permanent 
reality but are ever waxing and waning constantly 
changing their substance vand hence as aristotle 
says arose the doctrine of ideas which the platonists 
held for they assented to the opinion of heraclitus 
that all sensible objects are in a constant state of flux 
so that if there is to be any knowledge and science it 
must be concerning some permanent natures different 
from the sensible natures of objects for there can be no 
permanent science respecting that which is perpetually 
changing it happened that socrates turned his specu 
lations to the moral virtues and was the first philosopher 
who endeavoured to give universal definitions of such 
matters he wished to reason systematically and therefore 
he tried to establish definitions for definitions are the 
basis of systematic reasoning there are two things 
which may justly be looked upon as steps in philosophy 
due to socrates inductive reasonings and universal defi 
nitions — both of them steps which belong to the foun 
dations of science socrates however did not make 
universals or definitions separable from the objects but 
his followers separated them and these essences they 
termed ideas and the same account is given by other 
writers f some existences are sensible some intelligi 
ble and according to plato they who wish to understand 
the principles of things must first separate the ideas from 
the things such as the ideas of similarity unity number 
magnitude position motion second that we must 
assume an absolute fair good just and the like third 
that we must consider the ideas of relation as knowledge 
power recollecting that the things which we perceive 
have this or that appellation applied to them because 
they partake of this or that idea those things being vrt 
which participate in the idea of the just those being

beautiful wliich contain the idea of the beautiful am 
many of the arguments by which this doctrine wtts main 
tained are to be found in the platonic dialogues thus 
the opinion that true knowledge consists in sensatiow 
which had been assperted by protagoms and others fs 
refuted in the taetdm and we may add so rietof 
ohsly refttted that the arguments thel put forth hare 
ever since exercised a strong influence upon the speed 
lative world it may be remarked tht in the bfiihaf 
of plato and of those who have since pmrsued thie 
same paths of speculation the interest of such discnu 
sions as those we are now referring to wafe by no means 
limited to their bearing upon mere theory but was 
closely connected with those great questions of morals 
which have always a practical import tose who asserted 
that the only foundation of knovledge was serishtloh 
asserted also that the only foundation of virtue wai the 
desire of pleasure and in plato the metaphysical part 
of the disquisitions conoeming knowledge in genefral 
though independent in its principles always seems to be 
subordinate in its purpose to the questions concenmig the 
knowledge of our duty 

since plato thus looked upon the ideas which wem 
involved in each department of knowledge as forming its 
only essential part it was natural that he should look 
upon the study of ideas as the true mode of pursuit 
knowledge this he himsdf describes in the phsebm 
 the beet way of arriving at truui is not very dilbieult to 
point out bat most hard to pursue all the arts whirh 
have ever been discovered were revealed iii this manneh 
it is a gift of the gods to man which as i conceive they

the ancients more clearsighted than we and lesa removed

tb whatever is said to be comes of one and of many 
and comprehends in itself the finite and the infinite in 
coalition being one kind and consisting of infinite indivi 
dufis and this being the state of things we must in 
eah ease endeavour to seize the one idea the idea of the 
kipd as the chief point for we shall find that it is there 
and when we have seized this one thing we may then 
consider how it comprehends in itself two or three or any 
other number and again examine each of these ramifica 
tions separately till at last we perceive not only that one 
is at the same time one and many but also how many 
and when we have thus filled up the interval between 
the infinite and the one we may consid that we have 
done with each one the gods then as i have said 
taught us by tradition thus to contemplate and to learn 
and to teach one another but the philosophers of the 
present day seize upon the one at hazard too soon or 
too late and then immediately snatch at the infinite 
but the intermediate steps escape them by which tiie 
subject is subdivided so that it can be the subject of logi 
cal exposition and discussion 

it would seem that what the author here describes as 
the most perfect form of exposition is that which refers 
each object to its place in a classification containing a 
complete series of subordinations and which gives a defi 
mtifm of each class we have repeatedly remarked that 
in sciences of classification each new definition which gives 
a tenable and distinct searation of classes is an important 
advance in our knowledge but that such definitions are 
rather the last than the first step in each advance in the 
progress of real knowledge these definitions are always 
the results of a laborious study of individual cases and 
are never arrived at by a pure eflfort of thought which is 
what plato appears to have imagined as the true mode of 
philosophizing and still less do the advances of other 
vol ir u

joiences consist in seizing at once upon the highest gene 
rality and filling in afterwards all the intermediate steps 
between that and the special instances on the contrary 
as we have seen the ascents from particular to genend 
are all successive and each step of this ascent reqiiires 
time and labour and a patient examination of actual 
fects and objects 

it would of course be absurd to blame plato for having 
inadequate views of the nature of progressive knowledge 
it the time when knowledge could hardly be said to have 
begun its progress but we already find in his specula 
tions as appears in the passages just quoted from his writ 
ings several points brought into view which will require 
our continued attention as we proceed in overlooking 
the necessity of a gradual and successive advance from 
the less general to the more general truths plato shared 
in a dimness of vision which prevailed among philo 
sophers to the time of francis bacon in thinking too 
slightly of the study of actual nature he manifested a 
bias from which the human intellect freed itself in the 
vigorous struggles which terminated the dark ages in 
pointing out that till knowledge implies a unity of what 
we observe as manifold which unity is given by the 
mind plato taught a lesson which has of late been 
too obscurely acknowledged the recoil by which mea 
repaired their long neglect of facts having carried ihem 
for a while so far as to think that facts were the whole 
of our knowledge and in analysing this principle of 
unity by which we thus connect sensible things into 
various ideas such as number magnitude positioa 
motion he made a highly important step which it has 
been the business of philosophers in succeeding times to 
complete and to follow out 

but the efficacy of platos speculations in their beai 
ing upon physical science and upon theory in general 
was much weakened by the confusion of practical mth

theoretical knowledge which arobo fvom the ethical 
propetiirities of the bocratic school in the platonic 
dialogues art and science are constantly spoken of indis 
criminatelj the skill possessed by the painter the 
awhitect the shoemaker is considered as a just example 
of human science no less than the knowledge which the 
geometer or the astronomer possesses of the theoretical 
truths with which he is conversant not only so but 
traditionary and mythological tales mystical imaginations 
and ntastical etymologies are mixed up as no less 
choice ingredients with the mbst acute logical analyses 
and the most exact conduct of metaphysical controversies 
there is no distinction made between the knowledge 
possessed by the theoretical psychologist and the physi 
cian the philosophical teacher of morals and the legislator 
or the administrator of law this indeed is the less to 
be wondered at since even in out own time the same 
confusion is very commonly made jy persons not other 
wise ignorant or uncultured 

on the other hand we may remark finally that platos 
admiration of ideas was not a barren imagination even so 
for as regarded physical science for as we have seen 
he had a very important share in the introduction of the 
theory of epicycles having been the first to propose to 
astronomers in a distinct form the problem of whldi that 
theory was the solution namely to explain the celes 
tial phenomena by the combination of equable cifdular 
motions this demand of an ideal hypothesis which 
should exactly express the phenomena sis well as they 
could then be observed md from which by the inter 
position of snitable steps all special cases might be 
deduced fiills in well with those views respecting the 
proper mode of seeking knowledge which we have quoted 
from the pkimus and the idea which could thui

represent and replace all the particular facts beiqg 
not only sought but found we ijiay readily suppose that 
the philosopher was by this event strongly confirmed in 
his persuasion that such an idea was indeed whajb the 
inquirer ought to seek in this conviction alj his genuine 
followers up to modern times have participated and thi 
though they have avoided the error of those who hold 
that facts alone are valuable as the elements of our know 
ledge they have frequently run into the opposite error pf 
too much despising and neglecting facts and of thinking 
that the business of the inquirer after truth was only a 
profound and constant contemplation of the conceptions 
of his own mind but of this hereafter 



chapter iii 
aristotle 

the views of aristotle with regard to the foundations 
of human knowledge are very different from those of his 
tutor plato and are even by himself put in opposition to 
tkem he dissents altogether from the platonic doctrine 
that ideas are the true materials of our knowledge and 
after giving respecting the origin of this doctrine the 
account which we quoted in the last chapter he goe oa 
to reason against it thus he says they devised 
ideas of all things which are spoken of as universals 
miich as if any one having to count a number of objeet 
should think that he could not do it while they were few 
and shpuld expect to count them by making them more 
numerous for the kinds of things are almost more 
numerous than the special sensible olgects by seeking 
the causes of which they were led to their ideas he 
• metapk xii

aristotle 

then goes on to urge several other reasons against the 
assumption of ideas and the use of them in philosophical 
researches 

aristotle himself establishes his doctrines by trains of 
reasoning but reasoning must proceed from certain first 
pripciples and the question then arises whence are 
these first principles obtained to this he replies that 
they are the result of ejpperience and he even employs 
the same technical expression by which we at this day 
describe the process of collecting these principles from 
observed facts — that they are obtained by inductiorl i 
have already quoted passages in which this statement is 
made the way of reasoning he saysf is the same 
in philosophy and in any art or science we must collect 
the facts ra xnrapxoyra and the things to which the facts 
happen and must have as large a supply of these as pos 
sible and then we must examine them according to the 
terms of our syllogisms there are peculiar 
principles in each science and in each case these prin 
ciples must be obtained from experience thus astrono 
mical observation supplies the principles of astronomical 
science for the phenomena being rightly taken the 
demonstrations of astronomy were discovered arid the 
same is the case with any other art or science so that 
if the facts in each case be taken it is our business to 
construct the demonstrations for if in our natural jiis 
tory xara riv lrropav we have omitted none of the facts 
and properties which belong to the subject we shall learn 
what we can demonstrate and what we cannot and 
again i it is manifest that if any sensation be wanting 
there must be some knowledge wanting which we are 
thus prevented from having for we acquire knowledge 
either by induction itrayay or by demonstratijcm and 

 hih ind sciy i t analyt priorf i

 review of opinions on knowledge 

dtmonstration is from uniteraals but inductiou from 
purtieulars it is impossible to have universal theoretical 
propositions except by induction and we cannot make 
inductions ivithout having sensation for sensation has to 
do with particulars 

it is easy to show that aristotle uses the term induc 
tion as we use it to express the process of collecting a 
general proposition from particular cases in which it is 
exemplified thus in a passage which we have already 
quoted he says induction and syllogism from induc 
tion is when we attribute one extreme term to tiie middle 
by means of the other the import of this technical 
phraseology will further appear by the example which he 
gives we find that several animals which are deficient 
in bile are longlived as man the horse the mule hence 
we infer that au animals which are deficient in bile are 
longlived 

we may observe however that both aristotles 
notion of induction and many other parts of his philoso 
phy are obscure and imperfect in consequence of his 
refiisiug to contemplate ideas as something distinct from 
sensation it thus happens that he always assumes the 
ideas which enter into his propositions as given and con 
siders it as the philosophers business to determine whe 
ther such propositions are true or not whereas the most 
important feature in induction is as we have said the 
introduction of a new idea and not its employment when 
once introduced that the mind in this manner givea 
ijmity to that which is manifold — that we are thus led to 
qeculative principles which have an evidence higher than 
any others— and tiiat a peculiar sagacity in sne men 
seiaes upop the conceptions by which the foots may be 
bound into true propositions — are doctrines which form no 
essential part of the philosophy of the stagirite although 

• afml prif ii rrtp r inaycryijt 



digitized by vjooq ic 



aristotle 

such views are sometimes recognized more or less clearly 
in his expressions thus he says there can be no 
knowledge when the sensation does not continue in the 
mind for this purpose it is necessary both to perceive 
and to have some unity in the mind alcroavofiivoif sxetv 
en ti iv tq vxs ftd many such perceptions having 
taken place some difference is then perceived and from 
the remembrance of these arises reason thus from 
sensation comes memory and from memory of the same 
thing often repeated comes experience for many acts of 
memory make up one experience and from experi 
ence or from any universal notion which takes a per 
manent place in the mind— from the unity in the 
manifold the same some one thing being found in many 
facts — springs the first principle of art and of science 
of art if it be employed about production of science 
if about existence 

i will add to this aristotles notice of sagacity 
since although little or no further reference is made to 
this quality in his philosophy the passage fixes our atten 
tion upon an important step in the formation of knowr 
ledge sagacity arxivom he saysf is a hitting by 
guess ivaroxla nf upon the middle term the conception 
common to two cases in an inappreciable time as for 
cmmple if any one seeing that the bright side of the 
moon is always towards the sun suddenly perceives why 
this is namely because the moon shines by the light of 
the sun — or if he sees a person talking with a rich 
man he guesses that he is borrowing money — or conjee 
tures that two persons are friends because they are 
enemies of the same person— to consider only the first 
of these examples the conception here introduced that 
of a body shining by the light which another casts upon 
it is not contained in the observed facts but introduced

by the mind it i in shoit that conception wbichin 
tbe act of induction the tnind superadds to the phenomena 
m they are presented by the senses and to iirvent such 
appropriate conceptions such eustochies is indeed tli© 
precise office of inductive sagacity 

attheendof this work the later analytics aristbtii 
ascribes our knowledge of principles to intellect pov qr 
as it appears necessary to translate the word intuitioft 
••since of our intellectual habits by which we aiin at 
truth some are always true but some admit of being 
false as opinion and reasoning but science and tntuition 
are always true and since there is nothing which is more 
certain than science except intuition and since priiv 
ciples are better known to us than the deductions from 
them and since all seiextce is connected by reasoning 
we cannot have science respeeting wnciples con 
sidering this then and that the beginning of demonstra 
tion cannot be demonstration nor the beginning of 
science science and since as we have said there is no 
ther kind of truth intuition must be the beginning 
science 

what is here said is no doubt in accordance with 
the doctrines which we have endeavoured to estabksh 
respecting the nature of science if by this iruuiiiii we 
understand that contemplation of certain fundamental 
ideas which is the basis of all rigorous knowledge but 
notwithstanding this apparent approximation aristotle 
was far from having an habitual and practical possession 
of the principles which he thus touches upon he did 
not in reality construct his philosophy by giving unity 
to that which was manifold or by seeking in intuition 
principles which might be the basis of demonstration 
nor did he collect in each subject fundamental proposi 
tions by an induction of particulars he rather endea

outed to divide than to unite he enajdoyed himself not 
in eombining facts but in analysing notions and the 
criterion to wfaioh he referred his analysis as not the 
acts of our experience but our habits of language 
thus his opinions rested not upon sound inductions 
gathered in each case from the phenomena by means of 
appropriate ideas but upon the loose and vague generali 
ation which are implied in the common use of speech 

yet aristotle was so far condstent with his own 
doctrine of the derivation of knowledge from experience 
thai he made in almost every province of human know 
ledge a vast collection of such special facts as the expe 
rieilce of his time supplied these collections are aln¥st 
tmrivalled even to the present day especially in natural 
history in other departments when to the faet we 
must add the right inductive idea in order to obtain 
truth we find little of value in the aristotelic woris 
but in those parts which refer to natural history we 
find not only an immense and varied collection of facts 
and observations but a sagacity and acuteness in classifi 
cation which it is impossible not to admire this indeed 
appears to have been the most eminent fietculty in aris 
totles mind 

the influence of aristotle in succeeding ages will

deductiodall that £xpehenc did not immediately ftup 
ply and thus with these two grekt names began that 
struggle of opposite opinions which has ever since that 
time agitated the speculatire world as men have urged 
the claims of ideas or of experience to our respect 
and as alternately each of these elements of knowledge 
has been elevated above its due place while the other 
has been unduly depressed we shall see the successive 
turns of this balanced struggle in the remaining portions 
of this review 

but we may observe that practically the influence of 
plato predominated rather than that of aristotle in the 
remaining part of the history of ancient philosophy it 
was indeed an habitual subject of dispute among men of 
letters whether the sources of true knowledge are to be 
found in the senses or in the mind the epicureans taking 
one side of this alternative and the academics another 
while the stoics in a certain manner included both ele 
ments in their view but none of these sects showed 
their persuasion that the materials of knowledge were to 
be found in the domain of sense by seeking them there 
no one appears to have thought of following the example 
of aristotle and gathering together a store of observed 
facts we may except perhaps assertions belonging to 
some provinces of natural history which were collected 
by various writers but in these the mixed character of 
the statements the want of discrimination in the estimate 
of evidence the credulity and love of the marvellous 
which the authors for the most part displayed showed 
that instead of improving upon the example of aristotle 
they were wandering further and further from the path of 
real knowledge and while they thus collected with so 
little judgment such statements as offered themselves it 
hardly appears to have occurred to any one to enlarge 
the stores of observation by the aid of experiment and

to loarn what the laws of nature were by trying what 
were their results in particular oases they used ho 
instruments for obtaining an insight into the constitution 
of the universe except logical distinctions and discus 
sions and proceeded as if the phenomena familiar to 
their predecessors must contain all that was needed as a 
basis for natural philosophy by thus contenting them 
selves with the facts which the earlier philosophers had 
contemplated they were led also to confine themselves to 
the ideas which those philosophers had put forth for 
all the most remarkable alternatives of hypothesis so far 
as they could be constructed with a slight and common 
knowledge of phenomena had been promulgated by the 
acute and profound thinkers who gave the first impulse 
to philosophy and it was not given to man to add much 
to the original inventions of their minds till he had 
undergone anew a long discipline of observation and of 
thought employed upon observation thus the later 
authors of the oreek schools became little better than 
commentators on the earlier and the common places 
with which the different schools carried on their debates 
—the constantly recurring argument with its known 
attendant answer — the distinctions drawn finer and finer 
and leading to nothing — render the speculations of those 
times a scholastic philosophy in the same sense in which 
we employ the term when we speak of the labours of the 
middle ages it will be understood that i now refer to 
that which is here my subject the opinions concerning 
our knowledge of nature and the methods in use for the 
purpose of obtidning such knowledge whether the 
moral speculations of the ancient world were of the same 
stationary kind going their round in a limited circle like 
their metaphysics and physics must be considered on 
some other occasion

sicial philosophy i may take a passage from galens cota 
mentary on the treatise of hippocrates on the elements 
 wht then he asks is the method of discovering 
these elements to me it seems there can be no other 
than that which was introduced by hippocrates forre 
must reason first considering if an element be a thng 
which is one according to its idea iv n riv ls€av and 
next if many and various and dissimilar how many knd 
of what kind they are and how related by their associa

prising both our bodies and other things hippocrates 
shows for if man were one element only he could not 
fall sick fbr there would be nothing which could derange 
his health if he were of one element only we have 
seen in the history of science that galen is one of the 
greatest names in ancient physiology but wheii h 
makes the attempt to pass at one step from the most 
familiar facts to the ultimate constitution of the universe 
it is not wonderful that his reasonings are of no real 
value or import 

before we quit the ancients we may observe some 
peculiarities in the roman disciples of the greek phito 
sophy which may be worthy our notice 



chapter v 
the romans 



the romans had no philosophy but that whidi they 
borrowed from the greeks and wht they thus received 
they hardly made entirely their own the vast and pro 
found question of which we have been speaking the rela 
tion between existence and our knowledge of what

as to discern how wide and deep it is in the develop 
ment of the ideas bj which nature is to be understood 
they went no further than their gredc masters had gone 
npr indeed was more to be looked for and in the 
picqtical habit of accumulating observed facts as mate 
rials for knowledge they were much less discriminating 
and more credulous than their greek predecessors the 
descient from aristotle to pliny in the judiciousness of 
the authors and the value of their collections of facts 
is immensew 

since the romans were thus servile followers of their 
greek teachers and little acqikiinted with any example 
of new truths collected from the world around them it 
was not to be expected that they could have any juat 
conception of that long and niagnificent ascent from one 
set of truths to others of higher order and wider compass 
which the history of science began to exhibit when the 
human mind recovered its progressive habits yet some 
dim presentiment of the splendid career thus destined for 
ifhe intellect of man appears from time to time to have 
arisen in tbejr minds periiaps the ciroumstance which 
most powerfully contributed to suggest this vision was 
the vast intellectual progress which they were themselves 
conscious of having made through the introduction of 
the greek philosophy and to this may be added per 
haps some other features of national character their 
temper was too stubborn to acquiesce in the absolute 
authority of the greek philosophy although their minds 
werc not inventive enough to establish a rival by itds side 
and the wonderful progress of their political power had 
gien them a hope in the progress of man which the 
gereeks never possessed the roman as he believed the 
fortune of his state to be destined for eternity believed 
also in the immortal destiny and endless advance of that

intellectual hepublio of whih he had been admitted a 
denizen 

it is easy to find examples of such feelings as i have 
endeayoured to describe the enthusiasm with which 
lucretius and virgil speak of physical knowledge mani 
festly arises in a great measure from the delight which 
they had felt in becoming acquainted with the gnk 
theories 

me tero primum dalces ante omnia mnitt 
quarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore

admovere oculis distantia sidera nostris 
theraqme ingenio snpposnere suo 

sic petitur coslum non nt ferat ossam olympns 
summaque peliacus sidera tanget apex 

and from the whole tenour of these and similar pas 
sages it is eyident that the intellectual pleasure wbid 
arises from our first introduction to a beautiflil physical 
theory had a main share in producing this enthusiasm 
at the contemplation of the yictories of soiqce altbougl 
undoubtedly the morel philosophy whidh wa never sepa 
jttted from the natural philosophy and the triumph oter 
superstitious fears which a knowledge of nature was 
supposed to furnish added warmth to the felii of 
exultation 

we may trace a similar imprestton in the ardent 
expressions which pliny f makes use of in speaking of the 
early astronomers and which we have quoted in the 
history great men elevated above the common 
standard of human nature by discovering the laws whkh

mind of man from the fears which eclipses inspired 

this exulting contemplation of what science had done 
naturally led the mind to an anticipation of further 
achievements still to be performed expressions of this 
fueling occur in seneca and are of the most remarkable 
kind as the following example will show 

 why do we wonder that comets so rare a pheno 
mena have not yet had their laws assigned — that we 
should know so little of their beginning and their end 
when their recurrence is at wide intervals it is not yet 
fifteen hundred years since greece

reckoned the stars and gave them names there are 
still many nations which are acquainted with the heavens 
by sight only which do not yet know why the moon dis 
appears why she is eclipsed it is but lately that among

the schoolmen of the middle ages 

in the history of the sciences i have devoted a book 
to the state of science in the middle agee and have 
eadeatcmired to analyse the intellectual defects of that 
period among the characteristic features of the human 
mind duting those times i have noticed indistinctness of 
ideas a goramentatorial spirit mysticism and dogma 
tism the account there given of this portion of the 
history of man belongs in reality rather to the present 
work than to the history of progressive science for 
a we have there remarked theoretical science was during 
the period of whieh we speak almost entirely stationary 
and the investigation of uie causes of such a state of 
things may be considered as a part of that review in 
which we are now engaged of the vicissitudes of manv 
acquaintance wiuithe methods of discovery but when 
we offieffed to the world a history of science to leave so 
large a chasm unexplained would have mae the series

of events seem defective and broken and the survey of 
the middle ages was therefore inserted i would beg to 
refer to that portion of the former work the reader who 
wishes for information in addition to what is here given 

the indistinctness of ideas and the commentatorial 
disposition of those ages have already been here brought 
under our notice viewed with reference to the opposi 
tion between experience and ideas on which pointy 
as we have said the succession of opinions in a great 
measure turns it is clear that the commentatorial 
method belongs to the ideal side of the question for 
the commentator seeks for such knowledge as he values 
by analysing and illustrating what his author has said 
and content with this material of speculation does not 
desire to add to it new stores of experience and obser 
vation and with rerd to the two other features in the 
character which we gave to those ages we may observe 
that dogmatism demands for philosophical theories the 
iubmission of mind due to those revealed religious doc 
trines which are to guide our conduct and direct our 
hopes while mysticism elevates ideas into realities and 
offers them to us as the objects of our religious regard 
thus the mysticism of the middle ages and their dogma 
tism alike arose from not discriminating the offices of 
theoretical and practical philosophy mysticism claimed 
for ideas the dignity and reality of principles of mordi 
action and religious hope dogmatism imposed theoretical 
opinions respecting speculative points with the imperative 
tone of rules of conduct and fiiith 

if however the opposite claims of theory and prac 
tice interfered with the progress of science by the con 
fusion they thus occasioned they did so far more by 
drawing men away altogether from mere physical specu 
lations the christian religion with its precepts its 
hopes and its promises became the leading subject of

mens thoughts and the great active truths thus revealed 
and the duties thus enjoined made all inquiries of mere 
curiosity appear frivolous and unworthy of msui the 
fathers of the church sometimes philosophized ill but 
far more commonly they were too intent upon the gredt 
lessons which they had to teach respecting mans situation 
in the eyes of his heavenly master to philosophize at 
all respecting things remote from the business of life and 
of no importance in mans spiritual concerns 

yet man has his intellectual as well as his spiritual 
wants he has acuities which demand systems and 
reasons as well as precepts and promises the christian 
doctor who knew so much more than the heathen philo 
sopher respecting the creator and governor of the uni 
verse was not long content to know or to teaeh less re 
specting the universe itself while it was still maintained 
that theology was the only really important study theo 
logy was so extended and so fashioned as to include all 
other knowledge and after no long time the fathers 
of the church themselves became the authors of systems 
of universal knowledge 

but when this happened the commentatorial spirit 
was still in its full vigour the learned christians could 
not any more than the later greeks or the romans 
devise by the mere force of their own invention new 
systems fulj comprehensive and connected like those of 
the heroic age of philosophy the same mental tenden 
cies which led men to look for speculative coherence aiid 
completeness in the view of the universe led them also 
to admire and dwell upon the splendid and acute specu 
lations of the greeks they were content to find in 
these immortal works the answers to the questions whicfa 
their curiosity prompted and to seek what further satis 
faction they might require in analysing and unfolding 
the doctrines promulgated by those great masters of

knowledge thus the christian doctors became as to 
general philosophy commentators upon the ancient greek 
teacheirs 

among these they selected aristotle as their peculiar 
object of admiration and study the vast store both of 
opinions and facts which his works contain his acute 
dibtinctions his cogent reasons in some portions of his 
speculations his symmetrical systems in almost au natu 
rally commended him to the minds of subtle and curious 
men we may add that plato who taught men to con 
template ideas separate from things was not so well 
fitted for general acceptance as aristotle who rejected 
this separation for although the due apprehension of 
this opposition of ideas and sensations is a necessary step 
in the progress of true philosophy it requires a clearer 
view and a more balanced mind than the common herd 
of students possess and aristotle who evaded the neces 
sary perplexities in which this antithesis involves us 
appeared to the temper of those times the easier and the 
plainer guide of the two 

the doctors of the middle ages having thus adopted 
aristotle as their master in philosophy we shall not be 
surprised to find them declaring after him that ezperienee 
is the source of our knowledge of the visible world but 
though like the greeks they thus talked of experiment 
like the greeks they showed little disposition to discover 
the laws of nature by observation of facts this barren 
and formal recognition of experience or sensation as one 
source of knowledge not being illustrated by a practical 
study of nature and by real theoretical truths obtained 
by such a study remained ever vague wavering and 
empty such a mere acknowledgement cannot in aay 
times ancient or modem be considered as indicating b 
just apprehension of the true basis and nature of science

ence is the source of our knowledge of the external 
world the teachers of the middle ages were in the dark 
but so on this subject have been almost all the writers of 
all ages with the exception of those who in recent times 
have had their minds enlightened by contemplating phi 
losophically the modem progress of science the opinions 
of the doctors of the middle ages on such subjects gene 
rally had those of aristotle for their basis but the sub 
ject was often still further analysed and systematized 
with an acute and methodical skill hardly inferior to that 
of aristotle himself 

the stagirite in the beginning of his physics had 
made the following remarks in all bodies of doctrine 
which involve principles causes or elements science 
and knowledge arise from the knowledge of these for 
we then consider ourselves to know respecting any 
subject when we know its first cause its first prin 
ciples its ultimate elements it is evident therefore 
that in seeking a knowledge of nature we must first 
know what are its principles but the course of our 
knowledge is from the things which are better known 
and more manifest to us to the things which are more 
certain and evident in nature for those tilings which 
are most evident in truth are not most evident to us 
and consequently we must advance from things ob 
scure in nature but manifest to us towards the things 
which are really in nature more clear and certain the 
things which are first obvious and apparent to us are 
complex and from these we obtain by analysis prin 
ciples and elements we must proceed from universals 
to particulars for the whole is better known to our 
senses than the parts and for the same reason the uni 
versal better known than the particular and thus 
words signify things in a large and indiscriminate way 
which is afterwards analysed by definition as we see that

the children at first call all men fathery and all womgn

there are various assertions contained in this extract 
which came to be considered as standard maxims and 
which occur constantly in the writers of the middle ages 
such are for instance the maxim vere scire est per 
causas scire the remark that compounds are known to us 
before their parts and the illustration from the expressions 
used by children of the mode in which this subject was 
treated by the ichoolmen we may judge by looking at 
passages of thomas aquinas which treat of the subject 
of the human understanding in the summa theologies 
the eightyfifth question is on the manner and order of 
understanding which subject he considers in eight arti 
cles j and these must even now be looked upon as exhi 
biting many of the most important and interesting points 
of the subject they are first whether our under 
standing understands by abstracting ideas species from 
appearances second whether intelligible species ab 
•stracted from appearances are related to our understand 
ing as that which we understand or that by which we 
understand third whether our understanding doe 
naturally understand universals first fourth whether 
our understanding can understand many things at once 
fifih whether our understanding understands by com 
pounding and dividing sith whether the understand 
ing can err seventh whether one person can understand 
the same thing better than another eighth whether 
•our understanding understands the indivisible sooner than 
the divisible and in the discussion of the last point for 
example reference is made to the passage of aristotle 
which we have already quoted it may seem he bbjb 
 tliat wa understand the indivisible before the divisible 
ibr thf philosopher says that we understand and know 
by knowing principles and elements but indivisibles are

the principles and elements of divisible things but te 
this we maj reply that in our receiving of science prin 
ciples and elements are not always first for sometimes 
from the sensible effects we go on to the knowledge of 
intelligible principles and causes we see that both 
the objection and the answer are drawn from aristotle 

we find the same close imitation of aristotle in 
albertus magnus who like aquinas flourished in the 
thirteenth century albertus indeed wrote treatises 
correaponding to almost all those of the stagirite and 
was called the ape of aristotle in the beginning of his 
physics he says knowledge does not always begin from 
that which is first according to the nature of things but 
from that of which the knowledge is easiest for the 
hiunan intellect on account of its relation to the seusec 
propter reflewionam quam habet ad sensum collects science 
from the senses and thus it is easier for our knowledge 
to begin from that which we can apprehend by sense 
imagination and intellect than from that which we appre 
hend by intellect alone we see that he has somen 
what systematized what he has borrowed 

this disposition to dwell upon and systematize the 
leading doctrines of metaphysics assumed a more defi 
nite and permanent shape in the opposition of the 
realists and nominalists the opposition involved in 
this controversy is in fact that fundamental antithesis 
of sense and ideas about which philosophy has always 
been engaged and of which we have marked the mani 
festation in plato and aristotle the question what 
is the object of our thoughts when we reason concerning 
the external world must occur to all speculative minds r 
and the difficulties of the answer are manifest we 
must reply either that our own ideas or that sensible 
things are the elements of our knowledge of nature 
and then the scruples again occur — how we have any

general knowledge if our thoughts are fixed on particular 
objects and on the other hand — how we can attain to 
any true knowledge of nature bj contemplating ids 
which are not identical with objects in nature the two 
opposite opinions maintained on this subject were on the 
one side — that our general propositions refer to objects 
which are red though divested of the peculiarities of 
individuals and on the other side — that in such propo 
sitions individuals are not represented by any reality but 
bound together by a name these two views were held 
by the realists and nominalists respectively and thus 
the realist manifested the adherence to ideas and the 
nominalist the adherence to the impressions of sense 
which have always existed as opposite yet correlative 
tendencies in man 

the realists were the prevailing sect in the scholastic 
times for example both thomas aquinas and duns 
scotus the angelical and the subtile doctor held this 
opinion although opposed to each other in many of their 
leading doctrines on other subjects and as the nomi 
nalist fixing his attention upon sensible objects is obliged 
to consider what is the principle of generdizomon in order 
that the possibility of any general proposition may be 
conceivable so on the other hand the realist beginning 
with the contemplation of universal ideas is compelled to 
ask what is the principle of individuatixmy in order tliat he 
may comprehend the application of general propositions 
in each particular instance this inquiry concerning the 
principle of individuation was accordingly a problem 
which occupied all the leading minds among the school 
men it will be apparent from what has been said that 
it is only one of the many forms of the fundamental 
antithesis of the ideas and the senses which we have 
constantly before us in this review

the recognition of the derivation of our knowledge 
in part at least from experience though always loose 
and incomplete appears often to be independent of the 
peripatetic traditions thus richard of st victor a 
writer of contemplative theology in the twelfth century 
says that there are three sources of knowledge experi 
ence reason faith some things we prove by experiment 
others we collect by reasoning the certainty of others 
we hold by believing and with regard to temporal 
matters we obtain our knowledge by actual experience 
the other guides belong to divine knowledge richard 
also propounds a division of himian knowledge which is 
clearly not derived directly from the ancients and which 
shows that considerable attention must have been paid to 
such speculations he begins by laying down clearly 
and broadly the distinction which as we have seen is of 
primary importance between practice and tlkeory practice 
he says includes seven mechanical arts those of the 
clothier the armourer the navigator the hunter the 
physician and the player theory is threefold divine 
natural doctrinal and is thus divided into theology 
physics and mathematics mauiematicsi he adds treats 
of the invisible forms of visible things we have seen 
that by many profound thinkers this vfor forms has been 
selected as best fitted to describe those relations of things 
which are the subject of mathematics again physics 
discovers causes from their effects and effects from their 
causes it would not be easy at the present day to give 
a better account of the object of physical science but 
richard of st victor makes this account still more 
remarkably judicious by the examples to which he 
alludes which are earthquakes the tides the virtues 
of plants the instincts of animals the classification of 
minerals plants and reptiles

omne genus iruticum lapidum quoque reptiliumque 

he further adds physical science ascends from effects 
to causes and descends again from causes to effects 
this declaration francis bacon himself might have 
adopted it is true that richard would probably have 
been little able to produce any clear and definite instances 
of knowledge in which this ascent and descent were 
exemplified but still the statement even considered as 
a mere conjectural thought contains a portion of that 
sagacity and comprehensive power which we admire so 
much in bacon 

richard of st victor who lived in the twelfth cen 
tury thus exhibits more vigour and independence of 
speculative power than thomas aquinas albertus mag 
nus and duns scotus in the thirteenth in the interval 
about the end of the twelfth century the writings of 
aristotle had become generally known in the west and 
had been elevated into the standard of philosophical 
doctrine by the divines mentioned above who felt a 
reverent sympathy with the systematizing and subtle 
spirit of the stagirite as soon as it was made manifest to 
them these doctors following the example of their 
great forerunner reduced every part of human know 
ledge to a systematic form the systems which they thus 
framed were presented to mens minds as the only true 
philosophy and dissent from them was no longer con 
sidered to be blameless it was an offence against reli 
gion as well as reason to reject the truth and the truth 
could be but one in this manner arose that claim which 
the doctors of the church put forth to control mens 
opinions upon all subjects and which we have spoken of 
 in the history of science as the dogmatism of the

middle ages there is no difficulty in giving examples 
of this characteristic we may take for instance a 
statute of the university of paris occasioned by a bull 
of pope john xxi in which it is enacted that no 
master or bachelor of any faculty shall presume to 
read lectures upon any author in a private room on 
account of the many perils which may arise therefrom 
but shall read in public places where all may resort and 
may faithfully report what is there taught excepting 
only books of grammar and logic in which there can be 
no presumption and certain errors of brescain are 
condemned in a rescript of the papal legate odo with 
the following expressions whereas as we have been 
informed certain logical professors treating of theology 
in their disputations and theologians treating of logic 
contrary to the command bf the law are not afraid to 
mix and confound the lots of the lords heritage we 
exhort and admonish your university all and singular 
that they be content with the landmarks of the sciences 
and faculties which our fathers have fixed and that 
having due fear of the curse pronounced in the law 
against him who removeth his neighbours landmark 
you hold such sober wisdom according to the apostles 
that ye may by no means incur the blame of innovation 
or presumption 

the account which in the history of science i gave 
of dogmatism as a characteristic of the middle ages has 
been indignantly rejected by a very pleasing modern 
ivriter who has with great feeling and great diligence 
brought into view the merits and beauties of those times 
termed by him ages of faith he urgesf that religious 
authority was never claimed for physical science and he 
quotes from thomas aquinas a passage in which the

 review of opinions on knowledge 

author protests against the practice of confounding opi 
nions of philosophy with doctrines of faith we might 
quote in return the rescript of stephen bishop of paris 
in which he declares that there can be but one truth and 
rejects the distinction of things being true according to 
philosophy and not according to the catholic faith and 
it might be added that among the errors condemned in 
this document are some of thomas aquinas himself we 
might further observe that if no physical doctrines were 
condemned in the times of which we now speak this was 
because on such subjects no new opinions were promul 
gated and not because opinion was free as soon as 
new opinions even on physical subjects attracted general 
notice they were prohibited by authority as we see in 
jthe case of galileof 

but this disinclination to recognize philosophy as 
independent of religion and this disposition to find in 
new theories even in physical ones something contrary 
to religion or scripture are it would seem very natural 

 tenneman viii 

t if there were any doubt oh this subject we might refer to the 
•writers who afterwards questioned the supremacy of aristotle and 
who with one voice assert that an infallible authority had been claimed 
for him thus laurentius valla quo minus ferendi sunt recentes

the evasions practised by reformers through fear of the dogmatism 
to which they had to submit for example the protestation of telesius

teadeticies of theologians and it would be unjust to 
assert that these propensities were confined to the periods 
when the authority of papal rome was highest or that 
the spirit which has in a great degree controlled and 
removed such habits was introduced by the reformation 
of religion in the sixteenth century we must trace to 
other causes the clear and general recognition of phi 
losophy as distinct from theology and independent of her 
authority in the earlier ages of the church indeed 
this separation had been acknowledged st augustin 
says a christian should beware how he speaks on 
questions of natural philosophy as if they were doctrines 
of holy scripture for an infidel who should hear him 
deliver absurdities could not avoid laughing thus the 
christian would be confused and the infidel but little 
edified for the infidel would conclude that our authors 
really entertained these extravagant opinions and there 
fore they would despise them to their own eternal ruin 
therefore the opinions of philosophers should never be pro 
posed as dogmas of faith or rejected as contrary to faith 
when it is not certain that they are so these words are 
quoted with approbation by thomas aquinas and it is 
said are cited in the same manner in every encyclope 
dical work of the middle ages this warning of genuine 
wisdom was afterwards rejected as we have seen and it 
it only in modern times that its value has again been 
fully recognized and this improvement we must ascribe 
mainly to the progress of physical science for a great 
body of undeniable truths on physical subjects being accu 
mulated such as had no reference to nor connexion with 
the truths of religion and yet such as possessed a strong 
interest for most mens minds it was impossible longer to 
deny that there were wide provinces of knowledge which

were not included in the dominions of theology and over 
which she had no authority in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries the fundamental doctrines of mechanics hydro 
statics optics magnetics chemistry were established and 
promulgated and along with them a vast train of conse 
quences attractive to the mind by the ideal relations 
which they exhibited and striking to the senses by the 
power which they gave man over nature here was a 
region in which philosophy felt herself entitled and im 
pelled to assert her independence from this region 
there is a gradation of subjects in which philosophy ad 
vances more and more towards the peculiar domain of 
religion and at some intermediate points there have 
been and probably will always be conflicts respecting 
the boundary line of the two fields of speculation for 
the limit is vague and obscure and appears to fluctuate 
and shift with the progress of time and knowledge 

our business at present is not with the whole extent 
and limits of philosophy but with the progress of phyncal 
science more particularly and the methods by which it 
may be attained and we are endeavouring to trace his 
torically the views which have prevailed respecting such 
methods at various periods of mans intellectual progress 
among the most conspicuous of the revolutions which 
opinions on this subject have undergone is the transition 
from aa implicit trust in the internal powers of mans 
mind to a professed dependence upon external observation 
and from an unbounded reverence for the wisdom of the 
past to a fervid expectation of change and improve 
ment the origin and progress of this disposition of 
mind the introduction of a state of things in which men 
not only obtained a body of indestructible truths from 
experience and increased it from generation to genera

declared such to be the source of their knowledge and 
such their hopes of its destined career — the rise in short 
of experimental philosophy not only as a habit but as a 
philosophy of experience is what we must now endea 
vour to exhibit 



chapter vii 
the innovators oe the middle ages 

general itemarks in the rise of experimental 
philosophy understanding the term in the way just now 
stated two features have already been alluded to the 
disposition to cast off the prevalent reverence for the 
opinions and methods of preceding teachers with an eager 
expectation of some vast advantage to be derived from a 
change and the belief that this improvement must be 
sought by drawing our knowledge from external observa 
tion rather than from mere intellectual efforts — the 
jmutrection agaimt authority y and the appeal to eape 
rience these two movements were closely connected 
but they may easily be distinguished and in fact persons 
were very prominent in the former part of the task who 
had no comprehension of the latter principle from which 
alone the change derives its value there were many 
malcontents who had no temper talent or knowledge 
which fitted them to be beformers 

the authority which was questioned in the struggles 
of which we speak was that of the scholastic system 
the combination of philosophy with theology of which 
aristotle presented in the form and manner which the 
doctors of the church had imposed upon him is to be 
considered the representative when there was demanded 
of men a submission of the mind such as this system

claimed the natural love of freedom in mans bosom 
and the speculative tendencies of his intellect rose in 
rebellion from time to time against the ruling oppres 
sion we find in all periods of the scholastic ages ex 
amples of this disposition of man to resist overstrained 
authority the tendency being mostly however com 
bined th a want of solid thought and showing itself 
in extravagant pretensions and fantastical systems put 
forwards by the insurgents we have pointed out one 
such opponent of the established systems even among 
the arabian schoolmen a more servile race than ever the 
europeans were we may here notice more especially 
an extraordinary character who appeared in the thirteenth 
century and who may be considered as belonging to the 
prelude of the reform in philosophy although he had 
no share in the reform itself

one of the many impulses of a spirit ardently thirsty 
of knowledge and novelty he hadf in his youth 
been a man of pleasure but was driven by a sudden 
shock of feeling to resolve on a complete change of life 
he plunged into solitude endeavoured to still the re 
morse of his conscience by prayer and penance and soon 
had his soul possessed by visions which he conceived 
were vouchsafed him in the feeling of religious enthu 
siasm thus excited he resolved to devote his life to the 
diffusion of christian truth among heathens and maho

receiving from heaven as his admirers declare his ars 
magna by which he was able without labour or effort to 
learn and apply all knowledge the real state of the case 
is that he put himself in opposition to the established 
systems and propounded a new art from which he 
promised the most wonderful results but that his art

able circles and give various combinations by meant of 
triangles and other figures and thus propositions are con 
structed 

it must be clear at once that no real knowledge 
which is the union of facts and ideas can result from 
this machinery for shifting about joining and diioining 
empty conceptions this and all similar schemes go 
upon the supposition that the logical combinations of 
notions do of themselves compose knowledge and that 
really existing things may be arrived at by a successive 
system of derivation from our most general ideas it is 
imagined that by distributing the nomenclature of abstract 
ideas according to the place which they can hold in our 
propositions and by combining them according to certain 
conditions we may obtain formulae including all possible 
truths and thus fabricate a science in which all aeienoea 
are contained we thus obtain the means of talking and 
writing upon all subjects without the trouble of thinking 
the revolutions of the emblematical figures are substi 
tuted for the operations of the mind both exertion of 
thought and knowledge of iacts become superfluous 
and this reflection adds an intelligent author explains 
the enormous number of books which lully is said to 
have written for he might have written those even 
during his sleep by the aid of a moving power which 
should keep his machine in motion having once deviae 
this invention for manufacturing science lully varied it 
in a thousand ways and followed it into a variety of 
developments besides synoptical tables he employs 
genealogical treefa which he dignifies with the name of 
the tree of science the only requisite for the applica 
tion of his systn was a certsiin agreement in the num 
bers of the classes into which different subjects were

distributed and as this syminetry does not really exist 
in the operations of our thoughts some violenoe was 
done to the natural distinction and subordination of eon 
ceptions in order to fit them for the use of the system 

thus lully while he professed to teach an art which 
was to shed new light upon every part of sdence was in 
ftct employed in a pedantic and trifling repetition of 
known truths or truisms and while he complained of 
the errors of existing methods he proposed in their place 
one which was far more empty barren and worthless 
than the customary processes of hmnan thought yet 
bis method is spoken of with some praise by leibnitz 
who indeed rather delighted in the region of ideas and 
words than in the world of realities but francis bacon 
speaks £ar otherwise and more justly on this subject f 
 it is not to be omitted that some men swollen with 
emptiness rather than knowledge have laboured te pro 
duce a certain method not deserving the name of a 
intimate method since it is rather a method of impos 
ture which yet is doubtless highly grateful to certain 
wouldbe philosophers this method scatters about cer 
tain little drops of science in such a manner that a smat 
trer may make a perverse and ostentatious use of them 
with a certain show of lemming such wa the art of 
lully which consisted of nothing but a mass and heap of 
the words of each science with the intention that he who 
can readily produce the words of any science shall be 
supposed to know the science itself such collections 
are like a rag shop where you find a patch of everything 
but nothing which is of any value

a very different character who was impelled to declare

mode in which real knowledge had been acquired ajid 
must be increased 

roger bacon was bom in near ilchester in 
somersetshire of an old family in his youth he was a 
student at oxford and made extraordinary progress in 
all branches of learning he then went to the univer 
sity of paris as was at that time the custom of learned 
englishmen and there received the degree of doctor of 
theology at the persuasion of robert grostete bishop 
of lincoln he entered the brotherhood of franciscans in 
oxford and gave himself up to study with extraordinary 
fervour he was termed by his brother monks doctor 
mirabilis we know from his own works as well as from 
the traditions concerning him that he possessed an inti 
mate acquaintance with all the science of his time which 
could be acquired from books and that he had made 
many remarkable advances by means of his own experi 
mental labours he was acquainted with arabic as well 
as with the other languages common in his time in the 
titles of his works we find the whole range of science 
and philosophy mathematics and mechanics optics 
astronomy geography chronology chemistry magic 
music medicine grammar logic metaphysics ethics 
and theology and judging from those which are pub 
lished these works are full of sound and exact knowledge 
he is with good reason supposed to have discovered or 
to have had some knowledge of several of the most 
remarkable inventions which were made generally known 
soon afterwards as gunpowder lenses burning specula 
telescopes clocks the correction of the calendar and the 
explanation of the rainbow 

thus possessing in the acquirements and habits of 
his own mind abundant examples of the nature of know 
ledge and of the process of invention bacon felt also a 
deep interest in the growth and progress of science

a spirit of inquiry respecting the causes which produced 
or prevented its advance and a fervent hope and trust 
in its future destinies and these feelings impelled him 
to speculate worthily and wisely respecting a reform of 
the method of philosophizing the manuscripts of his 
works have existed for nearly six hundred years in many 
of the libraries of europe and especially in those of 
england and for a long period the very imperfect poi 
tions of them which were generally known left the 
character and attainments of the author shrouded in a 
kind of mysterious obscurity about a century ago how 
ever his optis majus was published by dr s jebb 
principally from a manuscript in the library of trinity 
college dublin and this contained most or all of the 
separate works which were previously known to the 
public along with others still more peculiar and charac 
teristic we are thus able to judge of bacons knowledge 
and of his views and they are in every way well worthy 
our attention 

the ofos majus is addressed to pope clement the 
fourth whom bacon had known when he was legate in 
england as cardinalbishop of sabina and who admired 
the talents of the monk and pitied him for the persecu 
tions to which he was exposed on his elevation to the 
papal chair this account of bacons labours and views 
was sent at the earnest request of the pontiff besides 
the opus majusj he wrote two others the opiis minus 
and opus tertium which were also sent to the pope as 
the author saysf • on account of the danger of roads 
and the possible loss of the work these works still 
exist unpublished in the cottonian and other libraries

the opus majus is a work equally wonderful with 
regard to its general sohemey and to the speciltl treatises 
witli which the outlines of the plan are filled up the 
professed object of the work is to urge the necessity of a 
reform in the mode of philosophizing to set forth the 
reasons why knowledge had not made a greater progress to 
draw bkck attention to the sources of knowledge which had 
been unwisely neglected to discover other sources which 
were yet almost untouched and to animate men in the 
undertaking by a prospect of the vast advantages which 
it offered in the development of this plan all the lead 
ing portions of science are expounded in the most com 
plete shape which they had at that time assumed and 
improvements of a very wide and striking kind are pro 
posed in some of the principal of these departments 
even if the work had had no leading purpose it would 
have been highly valuable as a treasure of the most solid 
knowledge and boundest speculations of the time even 
if it had contained no such details it would have been a

to point out more especially the way in wliich the various 
principles which the reform of scientific method involyed 
are here brought into view 

one df the first points to be noticed for this purpose 
is the resistance to authority and at the stage of philo 
sophical history with wliich we here have to do this means 
resistance to the authority of aristotle as adopted and 
interpreted by the doctors of the schools bacons work 
is divided into six parts and of these parts the first is 
of the four universal causes of all human ignorance 
the causes thus enumerated f are — the force of unworthy 
authority — traditionary habit — the imperfection of the 
undisciplined senses — and the disposition to conceal our 
ignorance and to make an ostentatious show of our know 
ledge these influences involve every man occupy every 
coiidition they prevent our obtaining the most useful 
tod large and fair doctrines of wisdom the secrets of all 
sciences and arts he then proceeds to argue from the 
testimony of philosophers themselves that the authority 
of antiquity and especially of aristotle is not infallible 
 we find their books full of doubts obscurities and 
perplexities they scarce agree with each other in one

empty question or one worthless sophism or one opieration 
of science as one man agrees with another in the practicid 
operations of medicine surgery and the like arts of secu 
lar men indeed he adds not only the philosophers 
but the saints have fallen into errors which they have 
afterwards retracted and this he instances in augustin 
jerome and others he gives an admirable sketch of the 
progress of philosophy from the ionic school to aristotle 
whom he speaks of with great applause yet he adds 
 those who came after him corrected him in some things 
and added many things to his works and shall go on 
adding to the end of the world aristotle he adds is 
now called peculiarly f the philosopher yet there was a 
time when his philosophy was silent and unregarded either 
on account of the rarity of copies of his works or their 
diflsculty or from envy till after the time of mahomet 
when avicenna and averroes and others recalled this 
philosophy into the full light of exposition and although 
the logic and some other works were translated by 
boethius from the greek yet the philosophy of aristotle 
first received a quick increase among the latins at the 
time of michael scot who in the year of our lord 
 appeared bringing with him portions of the 
books of aristotle on natural philosophy and mathema 
tics and yet a small part only of the works of this 
author is translated and a still smaller part is in the 
hands of common students he adds further in the 
third part of the optis majus which is a dissertation on 
language that the translations which are current of these 
writings are very bad and imperfect with these views 
he is moved to express himself somewhat impatiently

respecting these works if i had he says power over 
the works of aristotle i would have them all burnt for 
it is only a loss of time to study in them and a course of 
error and a multiplication of ignorance beyond expres 
sion the common herd of students he says with 
their heads have no principle by which they can be ex 
cited to any worthy employment and hence they mope 
atid make asses of themselves over their bad translations 
and lose their time and trouble and money 

the remedies which he recommends for these evils 
are in the first place the study of that only perfect 
wisdom which is to be found in the sacred scripture 
in the next place the study of mathematics and the use 
of experiment f by the aid of these methods bacon 
tmticipates the most splendid progress for human know 
ledge he takes up the strain of hope and confidence 
which we have noticed as so peculiar in the roman 
writers and quotes some of the passages of seneca which 
we adduced in illustration of this — that the attempts in 
science were at first rude and imperfect and were after 
wards improved — that the day will come when what is 
still unknown shall be brought to light by the progress of 
time and the labours of a longer period — that one age 
does not sufllice for inquiries so wide and various — that the 
people of future times shall know many things unknown 
to us — and the time shall arrive when posterity will 
wonder that we overlooked what was so obvious bacon 
himself adds anticipations more peculiarly in the spirit of 
his own time we have seen he says at the end of 

aristotelis ego facerem omnes cremari quia non est nisi tcmpons 
amissio studere in illis et cause erroris et multiplicatio ignorantisb ultra

the work how aristotle by the ways which wisdom 
teaches could give to alexander the empire of the world 
atfd this the chiirch ought to take into consideration 
against the infidels and rebels that there may be a sparing 
of christian blood and especially on account of the 
troubles that shall come to pass in the days of antichrist 
which by the grace of god it would be easy to obviate 
if prelates and princes would encourage study and join 
in searching out the secrets of nature and art 

it may not be improper to observe here that this 
belief in the appointed progress of knowledge is not 
combined with any overweening belief in the unbounded 
and independent power of the human intellect on the 
contrary one of the lessons which bacon draws from the 
state and prospects of knowledge is the duty of faith and 
humility to him he says who denies the truth of 
the faith because he is unable to understand it i will 
propose in reply the course of nature and as we have seen 
it in examples and after giving some instances he 
adds these and the like ought to move men and 
excite them to the reception of divine truths for if in 
the vilest objects of creation truths are found before 
which the inward pride of man must bow and believe 
though it cannot understand how much more should man 
humble his mind before the glorious truths of god he 
had before saidt man is incapable of perfect wisdom 
in this life it is hard for him to ascend towards perfection 
easy to glide downwards to falsehoods and vanities let 
him then not boast of his wisdom or extol his knowledge 
what he knows is little and worthless in respect of that 
which he believes without knowing and still less in 
respect of that which he is ignorant of he is mad who 
thinks highly of his wisdom he most mad who exhibits

it as something to be wondered at ite adds as another 
leason for humility that be has proved by trial he could 
teach in one year to a poor boy the marrow of all that 
the most diligent person could acquire in forty years 
laborious and expensive study 

to proceed somewhat more in detail with rerd 
to roger bacotis views of a reform in scientific inquiry 
we may observe that by making mathematics and experii 
ment the two great points of his recommendation he di 
rected his improvement to the two essential parts of all 
knowledge ideas and facts and thus took the course 
which the most enlightened philosophy would have sug 
gested he did not urge the prosecution of experiment 
to the comparative neglect of the existing mathematical 
sciences and conceptions a fault which there is some 
ground for ascribing to his great namesake and successor 
francis bacon still less did he content himself with a 
mere protest against the authority of the schools and a 
vague demand for change which was almost all that was 
done by those who put themselves forward as reformers 
in the intermediate time roger bacon holds his way 
steadily between the two poles of human knowledge 
which as we have seen it is far jfrom easy to do there 
are two modes of knowing says he by argument and 
by experiment argument concludes a question but it 
does not make us feel certain or acquiesce in the con 
templation of truth except the truth be also found to b 
so by experience it is not easy to express more deci 
dedly the clearly seen union of exact conceptions with 
certain facts which as we have explained constitutes 
real knowledge

one large division of the opm mentis is on the 
usefulness of mathematics which is shown by a copious 
enumeration of existing branches of knowledge as chro 
nology geography the calendar and in a separate part 
optics there is a chapter in which it is proved by 
reason that all science requires mathematics and the 
arguments which are used to establish this doctrine show 
a most just appreciation of the office of mathematics iu 
science they are such as follows — that other sciences 
use examples taken from mathematics as the most 
evident — that mathematical knowledge is as it were 
innate in us on which point he refers to the well known 
dialogue of plato as quoted by cicero — that this science 
being the easiest offers the best introduction to the more 
difficult — that in mathematics things as known to us are 
identical with things as known to nature — that we can 
here entirely avoid doubt and error and obtain certainty 
and truth — that mathematics is prior to other sciences 
iu nature because it takes cognizance of quantity which 
is apprehended by intuition intuitu intellectus more 
over he addsf there have been found famous men as 
robert bishop of lincoln and brother adam marshman 
de marisco and many others who by the power of ma 
thematics have been able to explain the causes of things 
as may be seen in the writings of these men for instance 
concerning the rainbow and comets and the generatioii 
of heat and climates and the celestial bodies 

but undoubtedly the most remarkable portion of the 
optis majtis is the sixth and last part which is entitled 
 de scientia experimentali it is indeed an extraordi 
nary circumstance to find a writer of the thirteenth cen 
tury not only recognizing experiment as one source of 
knowledge but urging its claims as far more important 
than men had yet been aware exemplifying its value by

striking and just examples and speaking of its authority 
with a dignity of diction which sounds like a foremumiur 
of the baconian sentences uttered neariy four hundred 
years later yet this is the character of what we here 
find experimental science the sole mistress of specu 
lative sciences has three great prerogatives among other 
parts of knowledge first she tests by experiment the 
noblest conclusions of all other sciences next she dis 
covers respecting the notions which other sciences deal 
with magnificent truths to which these sciences of them 
selves can by no means attain her third dignity is that 
she by her own power and without respect of other 
sciences investigates the secrets of nature 

the examples which bacon gives of these prerogatives 
are very curious exhibiting among some error and credu 
lity sound and clear views his leading example of the first 
prerogative is the rainbow of which the cause as given by 
aristotle is tested by reference to experiment with a skill 
which is even to us now truly admirable the examples of 
the second prerogative are three i—firsu the art of making 
an artificial sphere which shall move with the heavens by 
natural influences which bacon trusts may be done 
though astronomy herself cannot do it — et tunc he 
says thesaurum unius regis valeret hoc instrumentum 
seoondlt the art of prolonging life which experiment 
may teach though medicine has no means of securing it 
except by regimen f — thirdly the art of making gold finer

xhe third prerogative of experimental science arts ind 
pendent of the received sciences is exemplified in many 
curious examples many of them whimsical traditions 
thus it is said that the character of a people may be 
altered by altering the air alexander it seems applied 
to aristotle to know whether he should exterminate 
certain nations which he had discovered as being irre 
claimably barbarous to which the philosopher replied 
 if you can alter their air permit them to live if not 
put them to death in this part we find the suggestion 
that the fireworks made by children of saltpetre might 
lead to the invention of a formidable military weapon 

it could not be expected that roger bacon at a time 
when experimental science hardly existed could give any 
precepts for the discovery of truth by experiment but 
nothing can be a better example of the method of such 
investigation than his inquiry concerning the cause of the 
rainbow neither aristotle nor avicenna nor senecm 
he says have given us any clear knowledge of this matter 
but experimental science can do so let the experimenter 
experimentator consider the cases in which he finds the 
same colours as the hexagonal crystals from ireland and 
india by looking into these he will see colours like these 
of the rainbow many think that this arises from some 
special virtue of these stones and their hexagonal figure 
let therefore the experimenter go on and he will find the 
same in other transparent stones in dark ones as well as 
in light coloured he will find the same effect also in 
other forms than the hexagon if they be furrowed in the 
surface as the irish crystals are let him consider too

that he sees the same colours in the drops which are 
dashed from oars in the sunshine — and in the spray thrown 
by a mill wheel — and in the dew drops which lie on the 
grass in a meadow on a summer morning — and if a man 
takes water in his moutli and projects it on one side into 
a simbeam — and if in an oil lamp hanging in the air the 
rays fall in certain positions upon the surieue of the oil 
rand in many other ways are colours produced we 
have here a oollecticm of instances which are almost all 
examples of the same kind as the phenomenon under 
consideration and by the help of a principle collected 
by induction from these facts the colours of the rainbow 
were afterwards really explained 

with regard to the form and other circumstances of 
the bow he is still more precise he bids us measure the 
height of the bow and of the sun to show that the centre 
of the bow is exactly opposite to the sun he explains 
the circular form of the bow — its being independent of 
the form of the cloud its moving when we move its flying 
when we follow — by its consisting of the reflections firom 
a vast number of minute drops he does not indeedi 
trace the course of the rays through the drop or aocpunt 
for the precise magnitude which the bow assumes but 
he approaches to the verge of this part of the explanation 
and must be considered as having given a most happy 
example of experimental inquiry into nature at a timq 
when such examples were exceedingly scanty in this 
respect he was more fortunate than francis bacon as we 
shall hereafter see 

we know but little of the biography of roger bacon 
but we have every reason to believe that his inftuencq 
upon his age was not great he was suspected of magic 
and is said to have been put into close confinement in

astrology as a science well worth cultivating but 
says he theologians and decretists not being learned 
in such matters and seeing that evil as well as good may 
be done neglect and abhor such things and reckon them 
among magic arts we have already seen that at the 
very time when bacon was thus raising his voice against 
the habit of blindly following authority and seeking for 
all science in aristotle thomas aquinas was employed 
in fashioning aristotles tenets into that fixed form in 
which they became the great impediment to the progress 
of knowledge it would seem indeed that something 
of a struggle between the progressive and stationary 
powers of the human mind was going on at this time 
bacon himself says never was there so great an 
appearance of wisdom nor so much exercise of study in 
so many faculties in so many regions as for this last 
forty years doctors are dispersed everywhere in every 
castle in every burgh and especially by the students of 
two orders he means the franciscans and dominicans 
who were almost the only religious orders that distin 
guished themselves by an application to study f which 
has not happened except for about forty years and yet 
there was never so much ignorance so much error and 
in the part of his work which refers to mathematics he 
says of that study t that it is the door and the key of 
the sciences and that the neglect of it for thirty or 
forty years has entirely ruined the studies of the latins 
according to these statements some change disastrous 
to the fortunes of science must have taken place about 
 soon after the foundation of the dominican and 
franciscan orders j nor can we doubt that the adoption

of the aristotelian philosophy by these two orders in 
the form in which the angelical doctor had systematized

three centuries the reform which roger bacon urged as

causes of dday in the advance of knowledge — in 
the insight possessed by learned men into the method 
by which truth was to be discovered the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries went backwards rather than 
forwards from the point which had been reached in 
the thirteenth roger bacon had urged them to have 
recourse to experiment but they returned with addi 
tional and exclusive zeal to the more favourite employ 
ment of reasoning upon their own conceptions he had 
called upon them to look at the world without but their 
eyes forthwith turned back upon the world within in 
the constant oscillation of the human mind between ideas 
and facts after having for a moment touched the latter 
it seemed to swing back more impetuously to the former 
not only was the philosophy of aristotle firmly established 
for a considerable period but when men began to ques 
tion its authority they attempted to set up in its place a 
philosophy still more purely ideal that of plato it was 
not till the actual progress of experimental knowledge for 
some centuries had given it a vast accumulation of force 
that it was able to break its way fully into the circle 
of speculative science the new platonist schoolmen 
had to run their course the practical discoverers had to 
prove their merit by their works the italian innovators

had to utter their aapirationb for a change before the 
second bacon could truly declare that the time for a fun 
damental reform was at length arrived 

it cannot but seem strange to any one who attempts 
to trace the general outline of the intellectual progress 
of man and who considers him as under the guidance of 
a providential sway that he should thus be permitted to 
wander so long in a wilderness of intellectual darkness 
and even to turn back by a perverse caprice as it might 
seem when on the very border of the brighter and better 
land which was his destined inheritance we do not 
attempt to solve this difficulty but such a course of

the fourteenth and fifteenth century if men of genius 
had at the beginning of that period made it their main

however this may be it is our business at present 
to trace the circumstances of this very lingering advance 
we have already noticed the contest of the nominalists 
and realists which was one form though with regard to 
scientific methods an unprofitable one of the antithesis 
of ideas and things though therefore this struggle 
continued we need not dwell upon it the nominalists 
denied the real existence of ideas which doctrine was to 
a great extent implied in the prevailing systems but the 
controversy in which they thus engaged did not lead 
them to seek for knowledge in a new field and by new 
methods the arguments which occam the nominalist 
opposes to those of duns scotus the realist are marked 
with the stamp of the same system and consist only in 
permutations and combinations of the same elementary 
conceptions it was not till the impulse of external cir 
cumstances was added to the discontent which the more 
stirring intellects felt towards the barren dogmatism of 
their age that the activity of the human mind was again 
called into full play and a new career of progression 
entered upon till then undreamt of except by a few 
prophetic spirits 

causes of progress — these circumstances were prin 
cipally the revival of greek and roman literature the 
invention of printing the protestant reformation and a 
great number of curious discoveries and inventions in 
the arts which were soon succeeded by important steps 
in speculative physical science connected with the first 
of these events was the rise of a party of learned men 
who expressed their dissatisfaction with the aristotelian 
philosophy as it was then taught and manifested a 
strong preference for the views of plato it is by no

this new platonic school but we may notice a few of 
the writers who belong to it so far at least as to indicate 
its influence upon the methods of pursuing science 

in the fourteenth century the frequent intercourse 
of the most cultivated persons of the eastern and west 
ern empire the increased study of the greek language 
in italy the intellectual activity of the italian states the 
discovery of manuscripts of the classical authors weie 
circumstances which excited or nourished a new and 
zealous study of the works of greek and roman genius 
the genuine writings of the ancients when presented in 
their native kfe and beauty instead of being seen only in 
those lifeless fragments and dull transformations which 
the scholastic system had exhibited excited an intense 
enthusiasm europe at that period might be reprer 
sented by platos beautiful allegory of a man who after 
being long kept in a dark cavern in which his knowledge 
of the external world is gathered from the images which 
stream through the chinks of his prison is at last led 
forth into the full blaze of day it was inevitable that 
such a change should animate mens efforts and enlarge 
their faculties greek literature became more and more 
known especially by the influence of learned men wlio 
came from constantinople into italy these teacheis

less and had never been accustomed to follow with 
servile submission of thought either these or any other 
leaders the effect of such influences soon reveals itself

by the study of classical literature translated among 
other learned works themistiuss paraphrastic exposition 
of the physics of aristotle with the view of trying 
whether the aristotelian natural philosophy could not 
be presented in good latin which the scholastic teachers 
denied in his preface he expresses great indignation 
against those philosophers who have written and disputed 
on philosophical subjects in barbarous latin and in 
an uncultured style so that all refined minds are 
repelled from these studies by weariness and disgust 
they have he says by this barbarism endeavoured to 
secure to themselves in their own province a supremacy 
without rivals or opponents hence they maintain that 
mathematics philosophy jurisprudence cannot be ex 
pounded in correct latin — that between these sciences 
and the genuine latin language there is a great gulf as 
between things that cannot be brought together and 
on this ground they blame those who combine the study 
of philology and eloquence with that of science this 
opinion adds hermolaus perverts and ruins our studies 
and is highly prejudicial and unworthy in respect to 
the state hermolaus awoke in others as for instance

in john picus of mirandula the same dislike to the 
reigning school philosophy as an opponent of the 
same land we may add marias nizolius of bersallo a 
scholar who carried his admiration of cicero to an exag 
gerated extent and who was led by a controversy with 
the defenders of the scholastic philosophy to publish 
 a work on the true principles and true method 
qf philosophizing in the title of this work he professes 
to give the true principles of almost all arts and sciences 
refuting and rejecting almost all the false principles of 
the logicians and metaphysicians but although in the 
work he attacks the scholastic philosophy he does little 
or nothing to justify the large pretensions of his title 
and he excited it is said little notice it is therefore 
curious that leibnitz should have thought it worth his 
while to reedit this work which he did in adding 
remarks of his own

sition to the scholastic system on the ground of taste

replace the doctrines of aristotle among these i may 
place nicolaus cusanus so called from cus a village 
on the moselle where he was bom in who was 
afterwards raised to the dignity of cardinal we mighty 
indeed at first be tempted to include cusanus among 
those persons who were led to reject the old philosophy 
by being themselves agents in the progressive movement 
of physical science for he published before copernicus 
and independently of him the doctrine that the earth is 
in motion but it should be recollected that in order 
to see the possibility of this doctrine and its claims to 
acceptance no new reference to observation was requisite

the heliocentric system was merely a new mode oif 
representing to the mind facts with which all astronomers 
had long been familiar the system might very easily 
have been embraced and inculcated by plato himself as 
indeed it is said to have been actually taught by pytha 
goras the mere adoption of the heliocentric view 
therefore without attempting to realize the system iii 
detail as copernicus did cannot entitle a writer of the 
fifteenth century to be looked upon as one of the authors 
of the discoveries of that period and we niust consider 
cusanus as a speculative antiaristotelian rather than as 
a practical reformer 

the title of cusanuss book de doctd ignorantidy 
shows how far he was from agreeing with those who con 
ceived that in the works of aristotle they had a full and 
complete system of all human knowledge at the out 
set of this book he says after pointing out some diffi 
culties in the received philosophy if therefore the case 
be so as even the most profound aristotle in his first 
phihsophy affirms that in things most manifest by 
nature there is a difficulty no less than for an owl to 
look at the sun since the appetite of knowledge is not 
implanted in us in vain we ought to desire to know that 
we are ignorant if we can fully attain to this we shall 
ctrrive at instructed ignorance how far he was from 
placing the source of knowledge in experience as opposed 
to ideas we majr see in the following passage f from 
another work of his on conjectures conjectures must 
proceed from our mind as the real world proceeds from 
the infinite divine reason for since the human mind 
the lofty likeness of god participates as it may in the 
fruitfulness of the creative nature it doth from itself as

in attendance upon the council of florence had imparted 
to many persons the doctrines of the greek philosopher 
and among others had infused a lively interest on this 
subject into the elder cosmo the head of the family of 
the medici cosmo formed the plan of founding a 
platonic academy ficinus well instructed in the 
works of plato plotinus proclus and other platonists 
was selected to further this object and was employed in 
translating the works of thes authors into latin it is 
not to our present purpose to consider the doctrines of 
this school except so far as they bear upon the nature 
and methods of knowledge and therefore i must pass 
by as i have in other instances done the greater part of 
their speculations which related to th§ nature of god 
the immortality of the soul the principles of goodness 
and beauty and other points of the same order the 
object of these and other platonists of this school how 
ever was not to expel the authority of aristotle by that 
of plato many of them had come to the conviction 
that the highest ends of philosophy were to be reached 
only by bringing into accordance the doctrines of plato

teachers urged the propriety of deposing aristotle from 
the supremacy he had so long eiyoyed now all these 
doctrines and others not a few he says f since they 
are platonic doctrines philosophically most true and 
consonant with the catholic faith whilst the aristotelian 
tenets are contrary to the faith and philosophically felse 
who will not both as a christian and a philosopher 
prefer plato to aristotle and why should not here 
after in all the colleges and monasteries of europe the 
reading and study of plato be introduced why should 
not the philosophy of aristotle be forthwith exiled from 
such places why must men continue to drink the 
mortal poison of impiety from that source with much 
more in the same strain 

the platonic school of which we have spoken had 
however reached its highest point of prosperity before 
this time and was already declining about the 
platonists appeared to triumph over the peripatetics j 
but the death of their great patron cardinal bessarion 
about this time and we may add the hollowness of their 
system in many points and its want of fitness for the 
wants and expectations of the age turned mens thoughts 
partly back to the established aristotelian doctrines and 
partly forwards to schemes of bolder and fresher promise

philosophical history of greece how readily the ideas of 
the platonic school lead on to a system of unthomable 
and unbounded mysticism john picus of mirandula 
added to the study of plato and the neoplatonists a mass 
of allegorical interpretations of the scriptures and the 
dreams of the cabbala a jewish systemf which pretends 
to explain how all things are an emanation of the deity 
to this his nephew francis picus added a reference to 
inward illumination t by which knowledge is obtained 
independently of the progress of reasoning john 
reuchlin or capnio born john baptist helmont 
bom francis mercurius helmont bom 
and others succeeded john picus in his admiration of the 
cabbala while others as jacob bcehmen rested upon 
internal revelations like francis picus and thus we 
have a series of mystical writers continued into modem 
times who may be considered as the successors of the 
platonic school and who all exhibit views altogether 
erroneous with regard to the nature and origin of know 
ledge among the various dreams of this school are certain 
wide and loose analogies of terrestrial and spiritual things 
thus in the writings of cornelius agrippa who was bom 
 at cologne we have such systems as the following 
— since there is a threefold world elemental celestial 
and intellectual and each lower one is governed by that 
above it and receives the influence of its powers so that 
tlie very archetype and supreme author transfuses the 
virtues of his omnipotence into us through angels 
htavens stars elements animals plants stones — into 
us i say for whose service he has framed and created all 
these things — the magi do not think it irrational that 
we should be able to ascend by the same degrees the

add them to these 

agrippas work de vanuate scientiarum may be said 
rather to have a sceptical and cynical than a platonic 
character it is a declamation in a melancholy mood 
against the condition of the sciences in his time his 
indignation at the worldly success of men whom he con 
sidered inferior to himself had he says metamorphosed 
him into a dog as the poets relate of hecuba of troy 
so that his impulse was to snarl and bark his professed 
purpose however was to expose the dogmatism the 
servility the selfconceit and the neglect of religious 
truth which prevailed in the reigning schools of philo 
sophy his views of the nature of science and the 
modes of improving its cultivation are too imperfect and 
vague to allow us to rank him among the reformers of 
science

put himself forwards as a reformer in philosophy and 
obtained no small niunber of adherents he was in 
most respects a shallow and impudent pretender and 
had small knowledge of the literature or science of hi§ 
time but by the tone of his speaking and writing he 
manifestly belongs to the mystical school of which we are 
now speaking perhaps by the boldness with which he 
proposed new systems and by connecting these with the 
practical doctrines of medicine he contributed something 
to the introduction of a new philosophy we have seen 
in the history of chemistry that he was the author of

the system of three principles salt sulphur and mer 
cury which replaced the ancient doctrine of four ele 
ments and prepared the way for a true science of che 
mistry but the salt sulphur and mercury of paracelsus 
were not he tells his disciples the visible bodies which 
we call by those names but certain invisible astral or 
sidereal elements the astral salt is the basis of the 
solidity and incombustible parts in bodies the astral 
sulphur is the source of combustion and vegetation the 
astral mercury is the origin of fluidity and volatility and 
again these three elements are analogous to the three 
elements of man — body spirit and soul 

a writer of our own country belonging to this mjrsti 
cal school is robert fludd or de fluctibus who waa 
bom in in kent and after pursuing his studies at 
oxford travelled for several years of all the theoso 
phists and mystics he is by much the most learned and 
was engaged in various controversies with mersenne 
gbssendi kepler and others he thus brings us in 
contact with the next class of philosophers whom we have 
to consider the practical reformers of philosophy — those 
who furthered the cause of science by making promul 
gating or defending the great discoveries which now 
began to occupy men he adopted the principle which 
we have noticed elsewhere of the analogy of the macro 
cosm and microcosm the world of nature and the world 
of man his system contains such a mixture and con 
fusion of physical and metaphysical doctrines as might be 
expected from his ground plan and from his school 
indeed his object the general object of mystical specula 
tors is to identify physical with spiritual truths yet the 
influence of the practical experimental philosophy which 
was now gaining ground in the world may be traced in 
him thus he refers to experiments on distillation to

air and fire and of the spirits which correspond to them 
and is conceived by some persons to have anticipated 
torricelli in the invention of the barometer 

we need no further follow the speculations of this 
school we see already abundant reason why the reform 
of the methods of pursuing science could not proceed 
from the platonists instead of seeking knowledge by 
experiment they immersed themselves deeper than even 
the aristotelians had done in traditionary lore or turned 
their eyes inwards in search of an internal illumination 
some attempts were made to remedy the defects of phi 
losophy by a recouise to the doctrines of other sects of 
antiquity when men began to feel more distinctly the 
need of a more connected and solid knowledge of nature 
than the established system gave them among these 
attempts were those of berigardf magemus and espe 
cially gassendi to bring into repute the philosophy of 
the ionian school of democritus and of epicurus but 
these endeavours were posterior in time to the new im 
pulse given to knowledge by copernicus kepler and 
galileo and were influenced by views arising out of the 
success of these discoveries and they must therefore be 
considered hereafter in the mean time some inde 
pendent efforts arising from speculative rather than 
practical reformers were made to cast off the yoke of the 
aristotelian dogmatism and to apprehend the true form 
of that new philosophy which the most active and hope 
ful minds saw to be needed and we must give some 
account of these attempts before we can commit our 
selves to the full stream of progressive philosophy

chapter ix 
the theoretical reformers of science 

we have already seen tliat patricius about the middle 
of the sixteenth century announced his purpose of found 
ing anew the whole fabric of philosophy but that in 
executing this plan he ran into wide and baseless hypo 
theses suggested by a prioii conceptions rather than by 
external observation and that he was further misled by 
fanciful analogies resembling those which the platonic 
mystics loved to contemplate the same time and the 
period which followed it produced several other essays 
which were of the same nature with the exception of 
their being free from the peculiar tendencies of the 
platonic school and these insurrections against the 
authority of the established dogmas although they did not 
directly substitute a better positive system in the place of 
that which they assailed shook the authority of the aris 
totelian system and led to its overthrow which took 
place as soon as these theoretical were aided by other 
practical reformers 

bernardinus telesitcs — italy always in modem times 
fertile in the beginnings of new systems was the soil on 
which these innovators arose the earliest and most 
conspicuous of them is bernardinus telesius who was 
born in at cosenza in the kingdom of naples 
his studies carried on with great zeal and ability first at 
milan and then at rome made him well acquainted with 
the knowledge of his times but his own reflections con 
vinced him that the basis of science as then received was 
altogether erroneous and led him to attempt a reform 
with which view in he published at rome his 
work bernardinus telesius of cosenza on the nature

of things according to principles of his own in the 
preface of this work he gives a short account of the 
train of reflection by which he was led to put himself in 
opposition to the aristotelian philosophy this kind of 
autobiography occurs not unfrequently in the writings of 
theoretical reformers and shows how livelily they felt the 
novelty of their undertaking after the storm and sack 
of rome in telesius retired to padua as a peaceful 
seat of the muses and there studied philosophy and ma 
thematics with great zeal under the direction of jerom 
amalthaeus and frederic delphinus in these studies he 
made great progress and the knowledge which he thus 
acquired threw a new light upon his view of the aristote 
lian philosophy he undertook a closer examination of the 
physical doctrines of aristotle and as the result of this 
he was astonished how it could have been possible that so 
many excellent men so many nations and even almost the 
whole human race should for so long a time have allowed 
themselves to be carried away by a blind reverence for a 
teacher who had committed errors so numerous and grave 
as he perceived to exist in the philosopher along with 
this view of the insufficiency of the aristotelian philoso 
phy arose at an early period the thought of erecting a 
better system in its place with this purpose he left 
padua when he had received the degree of doctor and 
went to rome where he was encouraged in his design by 
the approval and friendly exhortations of distinguished 
men of letters amongst whom were ubaldino bandinelli 
and giovanni della casa from rome he went to his 
native place when the incidents and occupations of a 
married life for a while interrupted his philosophical pro 
ject but after his wife was dead and his eldest son

grown to manhood he resumed with ardour the scheme 
of his youth again studied the works of aristotle and 
other philosophers and composed and published the two 
first books of his treatise the opening to this work 
sufficiently exhibits the spirit in which it was conceived 
its object is stated in the title to be to show that the 
construction of the world the magnitude and nature of 
the bodies contained in it are not to be investigated by 
reasoning which was done by the ancients but are to be 
apprehended by the senses and collected from the things 
themselves and the proem is in the same strain 
 they who before us have inquired concerning the con 
struction of this world and of the things which it contains 
seem indeed to have prosecuted their examination with 
protracted vigils and great labour but never to have looked 
at it and thus he observes they found nothing but 
error this he ascribes to their presumption for as 
it were attempting to rival god in wisdom and venturing 
to seek for the principles and causes of the world by the 
light of their own reason and thinking they had found 
what they had only invented they made an arbitrary 
world of their own we then he adds not relying 
on ourselves and of a duller intellect than they propose 
to ourselves to turn our regards to the world itself and 
its parts 

the execution of the work however by no means 
corresponds to the announcement the doctrines of 
aristotle are indeed attacked and the objections to 
these and to othey received opinions form a large part of 
the work but thes objections are supported by a priori 
reasoning and not by experiments and thus rejecting 
the aristotelian physics he proposes a system at least 
equally baseless idthough no doubts grateful to the 
author from its sweeping and apparently simple character 
he assumes three principles heat cold and matter

tfieonenoal reformers of scisncs 

heat is the principle of motion cold of immobility and 
matter is the corporeal substratum in which these incor 
poreal and active principles produce their effects it is 
easy to imagine that by combining and separating these 
abstractions in various ways a sort of account of many 
natural phenomena may be given but it is impossible to 
ascribe any real value to such a system the merit of 
telesius must be considered to consist in his rejection of 
the aristotelian errors in his perception of the necessity 
of a reform in the method of philosophising and in his 
persuasion that this reform must be founded on experi 
ments rather than on reasoning when he said we 
propose to ourselves to turn our eyes to the world itself 
and its parts their passions actions operations and spe 
cies his view of the course to be followed was righ 
but his purpose remained but ill fulfilled by the arbitrary 
edifice of abstract conceptions which his system exhibits 
bacon who about half a century later treated the 
subject of a reform of philosophy in a far more penetrating 
and masterly manner has given us his judgment of tele 
sius in his view he considers telesius as the restorer 
of the atomic philosophy which democritus and parme 
nides taught among the ancients and according to his 
custom he presents an image of this philosophy in an

the first of recent men but we have to do with him as 
the restorer of the philosophy of parmenides to whom 
much reverence is due with regard to this philosophy 
he pronounces a judgment which very truly expresses the 
cause of its rashness and emptiness it is he says 
such a system as naturally proceeds from the intellect 
abandoned to its own impulse and not rising from 
experience to theory continuously and successively 
accordingly he says that telesius although learned in 
the peripatetic philosophy if that were anything which 
indeed he has turned against the teachers of it is hindered 
by his affirmations and is more successful in destroying 
than in building 

the work of telesius excited no small notice and 
was placed in the indea espurgatoritts it made many 
disciples a consequence probably due to its spirit of 
systemmaking no less than to its promise of reform or 
its acuteness of argument for till trial and reflection 
have taught man modesty and moderation he can never 
be content to receive knowledge in the small successive 
instalments in which nature gives it forth to him it is 
the makers of large systems arranged with an appearance 
of completeness and symmetry who principally give rise 
to schools of philosophy 

thomas campaneua — accordingly telesius may be 
looked upon as the founder of a school his most dis 
tinguished successor was thomas campaneua who was 
born in at stilo in calabria he showed great 
talents at an early age prosecuting his studies at cosenza 
the birthplace of the great opponent of aristotle and 
reformer of philosophy he too has given us an

account of the course of thought by which he was led 
to become an innovator being afraid that not genuine 
truth but falsehood in the place of truth was the tenant 
of the peripatetic school i examined all the greek 
latin and arabic commentators of aristotle and hesi 
tated more and more as i sought to learn whether what 
they have said were also to be read in the world itself 
which i had been taught by learned men was the living 
book of god and as my doctors could not satisfy my 
scruples i resolved to read all the books of plato pliny 
galen the stoics and the democriteans and especially 
those of telesius and to compare them with thbtjirst 
and original writing the world that thus from the 
primary autograph i might learn if the copies contained 
anything false campanella probably refers here to an 
expression of plato who says the world is gods epistle 
to mankind and this image of the natural world as 
an original manuscript while human systems of philoso 
phy are but copies and may be false ones became a 
favourite thought of the reformers and appears repeatedly 
in their writings from this time when i held my 
public disputation at cosenza campanella proceeds 
and still more when i conversed privately with the 
brethren of the monastery i found little satisfaction in 
their answers but telesius delighted me on account of 
his freedom in philosophizing and because he rested upon 
the nature of things and not upon the assertions of men 
with these views and feelings it is not wonderful 
that campanella at the early age of twentytwo 
published a work remarkable for the bold promise of its 
title thomas campaneuas philosophy demonstrated to 
the senses against those who have philosophized in a arbi 
trary and dogmatical manner not taking nature for their 
guide in which the errors of aristotle and hi followers

philosophers confirmed by the opinions of the ancients here

this work was written in answer to a book against 
telesius by a neapolitan professor named marta and 
it was the boast of the young author that he had only 
employed eleven months in the composition of his 
defence while his adversary had been engaged eleven 
years in preparing his attadc gampanella found a 
favourable reception in the house of the marchese la 
velli and there employed himself in the composition 
of an additional work entitled on the sense of things 
aid magic and in other literary labours these how 
ever are full of the indications of an enthusiastic tern 
per inclined to mystical devotion and of opinions 
bearing the cast of pantheism for instance the title of 
the book last quoted sets forth as demonstrated in the 
course of the work that the world is the living and 
intelligent statue of god and that all its parts and 
particles of parts are endowed some with a clearer some 
with a more obscure sense such as suffices for the pre 
servation of each and of the whole besides these 
opinions which could not fail to make him obnoxious to 
the religious authorities gampanella engaged in schemes 
of political revolution which involved him in danger and 
ciilamity he took part in a conspiracy of which the 
object was to cast off the tyranny of spain and to make 
calabria a republic this design was discovered and 
campanella along with others was thrown into prison 
and subjected to torture he was kept in confinement 
twentyseven years and at last obtained his liberation

by the interposition of pope urban viii he was 
however still in danger from the neapolitan inquisition 
and escaped in disguise to paris where he received a 
pension from the king and lived in intercourse with the 
most eminent men of letters he died there in 

campanella was a contemporary of francis bacon 
whom we must consider as belonging to an epoch to 
which the calabrian school of innovators was only a 
prelude i shall not therefore farther follow the con 
nexion of writers of this order tobias adami a saxon 
writer an admirer of campanellas works employed him 
self about in adapting them to the german public 
and in recommending them strongly to german philoso 
phers descartes and even bacon may be considered as 
successors of campanella for they too were theoretical 
reformers but they enjoyed the advantage of the light 
which had in the mean time been thrown upon the 
philosophy of science by the great practical advances of 
kepler galileo and others to these practical reformers 
we must soon turn our attention but we may first notice 
one or two additional circumstances belonging to our 
present subject 

campanella remarks that both the peripatetics and 
the platonists conducted the learner to knowledge by a 
long and circuitous path which he vdshed to shorten by 
betting out from the sense without speaking of the 
methods which he proposed we may notice one maxim 
of considerable value which he propounds and to which 
we have already been led we begin to reason from 
sensible objects and definition is the end and epilogue of 
science it is not the begining of our knowing but only 
of our teaching 

andrew cesalpinusythe same maxim had already 
been announced by csesalpinus a contemporary of tele 
sius he was bom at arezzo in and died at borne

in csbsalpinus is a great name in science though 
professedly an aristotelian it has been seen in the 
history of science that he formed the first great 
epoch of the science of botany by his systematic arrange 
ment of plants and that in this task he had no successor 
for nearly a century he also approached near to the 
great discovery of the circulation of the blood f he 
takes a view of science which •includes the remark that 
we have just quoted from campanella we reach per 
fect knowledge by three steps induction division de 
finition by induction we collect likeness and agreement 
from observation by division we collect unlikeness and 
disagreement by definition we learn the proper sub 
stance of each object induction makes universals from 
particulars and offers to the mind all intelligible matter 
division discovers the difference of universals and leads 
to species definition resolves species into their principles 
and elements t without asserting this to be rigorously 
correct it is incomparably more true and philosophical 
than the opposite view which represents definition as the 
beginning of our knowledge and the establishment of 
such a doctrine is a material step in inductive philosophy f 
chordano bruno — among the italian innovators of 
this time we must notice the unfortunate giordano bruno 
who was bom at nola about and burnt at rome 
in he is however a reformer of a different school 
from campanella for he derives his philosophy from 
ideas and not from observation he represents himself 
as the author of a new doctrine which he terms the nolan 
philosophy he was a zealous promulgator and defender 
of the copernican system of the universe as we have 
noticed in the history of science campanella also 
wrote in defence of that system

it is worthy of remark that a thought which is often 
quoted from francis bacon occurs in brunos cena di 
cenercj published in i mean the notion that the 
later times are more aged than the earlier in the course 
of the dialogue the pedant who is one of the interlocu 
tors says in antiquity is wisdom f to which the philo 
sophical character replies if you knew what you were 
talking about you would see that your principle leads to 
the opposite result of that which you wish to infer — i 
mean that we are older and have lived longer than our 
predecessors he then proceeds to apply this by tracing 
the course of astronomy through the earlier astronomers 
up to copernicus 

peter hamus — i will notice one other reformer of 
this period who attacked the aristotelian system on 
another side on which it was considered to be most 
impregnable this was peter ramus bom in picardy 
in who ventured to denounce the logic of aris 
totle as unphilosophical and useless after showing an 
extraordinary aptitude for the acquirement of knowledge 
in his youth when he proceeded to the degree of master 
of arts he astonished his examiners by choosing for the 
subject of the requisite disputation the thesis that all 
which aristotle has said is not true this position so 
startling in he defended for the whole day without 
being defeated this was however only a formal acade 
mical exercise which did not necessarily imply any per 
manent conviction of the opinion thus expressed but 
his mind was really labouring to detect and remedy the 
errors which he thus proclaimed from him as from 
the other reformers of this time we have an account of 
this mental struggle f he says in a work on this sub

delivered from the darkness of aristotle when accord 
ing to the laws of our university i had spent three years 
and a half in the aristotelian philosophy and was now 
invested with the philosophical laurel as a master of 
arts i took an account of the time which i had consumed 
in this study and considered on what subjects i should 
employ this logical art of aristotle which i bad learnt 
with so much labour and noisor i found it made me not 
more versed in history or antiquities more eloquent in 
discourse more ready in verse more wise in any subject 
alas for me how was i overpowered how deeply did i 
groan how did i deplore my lot and my nature how did 
i deem myself to be by some unhappy and dismal fate 
and frame of mind abhorrent from the muses when i 
found that i was one who after all my pains could reap 
no benefit from that wisdom of which i heard so much 
as being contained in the logic of aristotle he then 
relates that he was led to the study of the dialogues of 
plato and was delighted with the kind of analysis of the 
subjects discussed which socrates is there represented as 
executing well he adds i began thus to reflect 
within myself — i should have thought it impious to say 
it to another— what i pray you prevents me from 
mcraiizing and from asking without regard to aris 
totles authority whether aristotles logic be true and 
correct it may be that that philosopher leads us wrong 
and if so no wonder that i cannot find in his books the 
treasure which is not there what if his dogmas be 
mere figments do i not tease and torment myself in 
vain tring to get a harvest from a barren soil he 
convinced himself that the aristotelian logic was worth 
less and constructed a new system of logic founded 
mainly on the platonic process of exhausting a subject by 
analytical classification of its parts both works his ani 
madversions on aristotle and his zogrec appeared in

the learned world was startled and shocked to find a young 
man on his first entrance into life condemning as faulty 
fallacious and useless that part of aristotles works which 
had always hitherto been held as a masterpiece of philo 
sophical acuteness and as the organon of scientific rea 
soning and in truth it must be gmnted that ramus 
does not appear to have understood the real nature and 
object of aristotles logic while his own system could 
not supply the place of the old one and was not of much 
real value this dissent from the established doctrines 
was however not only condemned but punished the 
printing and selling of his books was forbidden through 
france and ramus was stigmatized by a sentence which 
declared him rash arrogant impudent and ignorant and 
prohibited from teaching loc and philosophy he was 
however afterwards restored to the office of professor 
and though much attacked persisted in his plan of re 
forming not only logic but physics and metaphysics 
he made his position still more dangerous by adopting the 
reformed religion and during the unhappy civil wars of 
france he was deprived of his professorship driven from 
paris and had his library plundered he endeavoured 
but in vain to engage a german professor schegk to 
undertake the reform of the aristotelian physics a por 
tion of knowledge in which he felt himself not to be 
strong unhappily for himself he afterwards returned 
to paris where he perished in the massacre of st bar 
tholomew in 

ramuss main objection to the aristotelian logic is 
that it is not the image of the natural process of thought 
an objection which shows little philosophical insight for 
the course by which we obtain knowledge may well differ

the first in teaching but the effect which ramus pro

turning the minds of men to question the authority of 
aristotle on all points and had many followers espe

tlte reformers in general — it is impossible not to bo

reformers of philosophy of the period we have had to 
review roger bacon was repeatedly condemned and im 
prisoned and not to speak of others who suffered under 
the imputation of magical arts telesius is said to have 
been driven from naples to his native city by calumny 
and envy csesalpinus was accused of atheism f campa 
nella was imprisoned for twentyseven years and tortured 
giordano bruno was burnt at rome as a heretic ramus 
was persecuted during his life and finally murdered by 
his personal enemy jacques charpentier in a massacre of 
which the plea was religion it is true that for the 
most part these misfortunes were not principally due to 
the attempts at philosophical reform but were connected 
rather with politics or religion but we cannot doubt 
that the spirit which led men to assail the received philo 
sophy might readily incline them to reject some tenets 
of the established religion since the boundary line of 
these subjects is difficult to draw and as we have 
seen there was in most of the persons of whom we have 
spoken not only a wellfounded persuasion of the de 
fects of existing systems but an eager spirit of change 
and a sanguine anticipation of some wide and lofty phi

melanchtkon — it is not easy to point out with pre 
cision the connexion between the efforts at a reform in 
philosophy and the great reformation of religion in the 
sixteenth century the disposition to assert practically 
at least a freedom of thinking and to reject the corrup 
tions which tradition had introduced and authority main 
tained naturally extended its influence from one subject 
to another and especially in subjects so nearly connected 
as theology and philosophy the protestants however 
did not reject the aristotelian system they only reformed 
it by going back to the original works of the author 
and by reducing it to a conformity with scripture in 
this reform melanchthon was the chief author and wrote 
works on logic physics morals and metaphysics which 
were used among protestants on the subject of the 
origin of our knowledge his views contained a very phi 
losophical improvement of the aristotelian doctrines 
he recognized the importance of ideas as well as of 
experience we could not he saysf proceed to 
reason at all except there were by nature innate in man 
certain fixed points that is principles of science — as 
number the recognition of order and proportion logi 
cal geometrical physical and moral principles physical 
principles are such as these — everything which exists 
proceeds from a cause — a body cannot be in two places 
at once — time is a continued series of things or of mo 
tions — and the like it is not difficult to see that such 
principles partake of the nature of the fundamental 
ideas which we have attempted to arrange and enume

the practical reformers of science 

character of the practical reformers — we now come 
to a class of speculators who had perhaps a greater share 
in bringing about the change from stationary to progres 
sive knowledge than those writers who so loudly an 
nounced the revolution the mode in which the philoso 
phers of whom we now speak produced their impressions 
on mens minds was very different from the procedure of 
the theoretical reformers what these talked of they did 
what these promised they performed while the theo 
rists concerning knowledge proclaimed that great advances 
were to be made the practical discoverers went steadily 
forwards while one class spoke of a complete reform 
of scientific methods the other boasting little and often 
thinking little of method proved the novelty of their 
instrument by obtaining new results while the meta

the senses the physicists were examining nature by such 
means with unparalleled success and while the former 
even when they did for a moment refer to fectssoon rushed 
back into their own region of ideas and tried at once to 
seize the widest generalizations the latter fastening their 
attention upon the phenomena and trdng to reduce them 
to laws were carried forwards by steps measured and 
gradual such as no conjectural view of scientific method 
had suggested but leading to truths as profound and 
comprehensive as any which conjecture had dared to 
anticipate the theoretical reformers were bold self 
confident hasty contemptuous of antiquity ambitious of 
ruling all future speculations as they whom they sought 
to depose had ruled the past the practical reformers 
were cautious modest slow despising no knowledge 
whether borrowed from tradition or observation confident 
in the ultimate triumph of science but impressed with 
the conviction that each single person could contribute 
a little only to its progress yet though thus working 
rather than speculating — dealing with particulars more 
than with generals— employed mainly in adding to know 
ledge and not in defining what knowledge is or how 
adcutions are to be made to it — these men thoughtful 
curious and of comprehensive minds were constantly led 
to important views on the nature and methods of science 
and these views thus suggested by reflections on their 
own mental activity were gradually incorporated with 
the more abstract doctrines of the metaphysicians and 
had a most important influence in establishing an improved 
philosophy of science the indications of such views we 
must now endeavour to collect from the writings of the 
discoverers of the times preceding the seventeenth cen 
tury 

some of the earliest of these indications are to be 
found in those who dealt with art rather than with science

i have already endeavoured to show that the advance of 
the arts which give us a command over the powers of 
nature is generally prior to the formation of exact and 
speculative knowledge concerning those powers but 
art which is thus the predecessor of science is among 
nations of acute and active intellects usually its parent 
there operates in such a cases a speculative spirit lead 
ing men to seek for the reasons of that which they find 
themselves able to do how slowly and with what 
repeated deviations men follow this leading when under 
the influence of a partial and dogmatical philosophy the 
late birth and slow growth of soimd physical theory shows 
but at the period of which we now speak we find men 
at length proceeding in obedience to the impulse which 
thus drives them from practice to theory — from an ac 
quaintance with phenomena to a free and intelligent 
inquiry concerning their causes 

leonardo da vinci — i have already noticed in the 
history of science that the indistinctness of ideas 
which was long one main impediment to the progress of 
science in the middle ages was first remedied among 
architects and engineers these men so far at leajst as 
mechanical ideas were concerned were compelled by their 
employments to judge rightly of the relations and proper 
ties of the materials with which they had to deal and 
would have been chastised by the failure of their works 
if they had violated the laws of mechanical truth it 
avas not wonderful therefore that these laws became 
known to them first we have seen in the history 
that leonardo da vinci the celebrated painter who was 
also an engineer is the first writer in whom we find the 
true view of the laws of equilibrium of the lever in the

on that subject that already offered themselves at the 
beginning of the sixteenth century • he expresses 
himself as follows — theory is the general experiments 
are the soldiers the interpreter of the artifices of 
nature is experience she is never deceived our judg 
ment sometimes is deceived because it expects effects 
which experience refuses to allow and again we 
must consult experience and vary the circumstances till 
we have drawn from them genend rules for it is she 
who furnishes true rules but of what use you ask are 
these rules i reply that they direct us in the researches 
of nature and the operations of art they prevent our 
imposing upon ourselves and others by promising our 
selves results which we cannot obtain 

 in the study of the sciences which depend on mathe 
matics those who do not consult nature but authors are 
not the children of nature they are only her grand 
children she is the true teacher of inen of genius 
but see the absurdity of men isiey turn up their noses 
at a man who prefers to learn from nature herself rather 
than from authors who are only her clerks 

in another place in reference to a particular case he 
says nature begins from the reason and ends in ex 
perience but for all that we must take the opposite 
course begin from the experiment and try to discover 
the reason

never deceived — tbat we must varj onr experiments 
and draw from them general rules — that nature is the 
original source of knowledge and books only a derivative 
substitute — itith the lively iniage of the sons and grand 
sons of nature some of these assertions have been 
deemed and not without reason very siniilar to those 
made by bacon a century later yet it is probable that 
the import of such expressions in leonardos mind was 
less clear and definite than that whioh they acquired by 
the progress of sound philosophy when he says that 
theory is the general and experiments the soldiers be 
probably ment that theory directs men what experiments 
to make and had not in his inind the notion of a theo 
retical idea ordering and brigading the facts when he 
says that experieilce is the interpreter of nature we may 
reeouect that in a more correct use of this image expe 
rience und nature are the writing and the intellect of 
man the interpreter we may add that the clear appre 
hension of the importance of experience led in this as in 
other cases to an unjust depreciation of the value of what 
science owed to books leonardo would have made little 
progress if h had attempted to master a complex science 
astronomy for instancie by means of observation alone 
without the aid of books 

but in spite of such criticism leonardos maxims 
show extraordinary siigacity and insight and they appear 
to us the more remarkable when we find hbw rare suoh

practical discoverers to whom in reality the revolution 
in science and consequently in the philosophy of science

this bold estimate of the probable worthlessness of tradi

of theory founded upon experience among such dis 
coverers copernicus must ever hold a most distinguished 
place the heliocentric theory of the universe established 
by him with vast labour and deep knowledge was for the 
succeeding century the field of discipline and exertion 
of all the most active speculative ininds men during 
that time proved their freedom of thought their hopeful 
spirit and their comprehensive view by adopting incul 
cating and following out the philosophy which this theory 
suggested but in the first promulgation of the theory 
in the works of copernicus himself we find a iar more 
cautious and reserved temper he does not indeed give 
up the reality of his theory but he expresses himself so 
as to avoid shocking those who might as some afterwards 
did think it safe to speak of it as an hypotbem rather 
than a truth in his preface addressed to the pope 
after speaking of the difficulties in the old and received 
doctrines by which he was led to his own theory he 
says hence i began to think of the mobility of the 
arth and although the opinion seemed absurd yet be 
cause i knew that to others before me this liberty had 
been ccmceded of imagining any kinds of circles in order 
to explain the phenomena of the stars i thought it would 
also be readily granted me that i might try whether by 
supposing the earth to be in motion i might not arrive 
at a better ejcplanation than theinii of the revolutions of 
the celestial orbs nor does he anywhere assert that 
the seeming absurdity had become a certain truth or 
betray any feeling of triumph over the mistijcen belief 
of his predecessors and as i have elsewhere shown 
his disciples t indignantly and justly defended him from 
the charge of disrespect towards ptolemy and other an

mising the value or evidence of the great truths which

in his position of his discoveries below the temper 
which had led to them his quotation from ptolemy 
that he who is to follow philoschy must be a freeman 
in mind is a grand and noble maxim which it well 
became him to utter 

fomeiusin another of the great discoverers of this

the fathers of anatomy f exhibits something of the same 
respect for antiquity in the midst of his original specula

jointsy he quotes aristotles mechanical problems to 
prove that in all animal motion there must be some 
quiescent frdcrum and finds merit even in aristotles 
ignorance aristotle he says j did not know that 
motion was produced by the miuscle and after staggering 
about frtm one supposition to another at last is com 
pelled by the facts themselves to recur to an innate spirit 
which he ccmceives is contracted and which pulls and 
pushes and here we cannot help admiring the genius 
of aristotle who though ignorant of the muscle invents 
something which produces nearly the same effect as the 
muscle namely contraction and pulling he then 
with great acuteness points out the distinction between 
aristotles opinions thus favourably interpreted and 
those of galen in all this we see something of the 
wish to find all truths in the writings of the ancients

mawtolycus — francis maurolycus of messana whose 
mathematical works were published in was one of 
the great improvers of the science of optics in his time 
in his prefoce to his treatise on the spheres he speaks 
of previous writers on the same subject and observes 
that as they have not superseded one another they have 
not rendered it unfit for any one to treat the subject 
afresh yet he says mt is impossible to amend the 
errors of all who have preceded us this wonm be a task 
too hard for atlas although he supports the heavens 
even copernicus is tolerated who makes the sun to be 
fixed and the earth to move round it in a circle and 
who is more worthy of a whip or a scouiffe than of a 
refutation the mathematicians and astronomers of that 
time were not the persons most sensible of the progress 
of physical knowledge for the bases of their science and 
a great part of its substance were contained in the 
writings of the ancients and till the time of kepler

velocity which the heavenly bodies must have if the

the £ftcts on which the elementary truths of mechanics 
rest were known and admitted by the aristotelians and 
therefore could not be adduced as novelties on the con

would not have confirmed since he saysf we have 
undertaken the task of proving that aristotle is wrong in 
his opinions concerning motion there are certain absolute 
truths the objects of the intellect known of themselves 
which we must lay down in the first place and then 
as an example of these truths he states this any two 
bodies of equal size and figure but of different materials 
will have their natural velocities in the same proportion 
as their weights where by their natural velocities he 
means the velocities with which they naturally fall down

indeed in virtue of the clear views of the prospects 
which were then opening to science and of the methods 
by which her ftiture progress was to be secured while 
he exemplified those views by physical discoveries he 
do not rather deserve the still higher praise of being 
at the same time a theoretical and a practical reformed 
gilberts physical researches and speculations were em 
ployed principally upon subjects on which the ancients 
had known little or nothing and on which therefore it 
could not be doubtful whether tradition or observation 
was the source of knowledge such was magnetism for 
the ancients were barely acquainted with the attractive 
property of the magnet its polarity including repulsion 
as well as attraction its direction towards the north its 
limited variation from this direction its declination from 
the horizontal position were all modern discoveries 
gilberts work on the magnet and on the magnetism of 
the earth appeared in and in this he repeatedly 
maintains the superiority of experimental knowledge over 
the physical philosophy of the ancients his preftice 
opens thus since in making discoveries and searching 
out the hidden causes of things stronger reasons are 
obtained from trustworthy experiments and demonstrable 
arguments than from probable conjectures and the dog 
mas of those who philosophize in the usual manner he 
has he says endeavoured to proceed from common 
magnetical experiments to the inward constitution of the 
earth as i have stated in the history of magnetism f 
gilberts work contains all the fundamental fats of that 
science so fully stated that we have at this day little to 
add to them he is not however by the advance which

he thus made led to depreciate the ancients but only to 
claim for himself the same liberty of philosophizing which 
they had enjoyed to those ancient and first parents 
of philosophy aristotle theophrastus ptolemy hippo 
crates galen be all due honour from them it was that 
the stream of wisdom has been deriyed down to posterity 
but our age has discovered and brought to light many 
things which they if they were yet auve would gladly 
embrace wherefore we also shall not hesitate to ex 
pound by probable hypotheses those things which by 
long experience we have ascertained 

in this work the author not only adopts the copemican 
doctrine of the earths motion but speaksf of the con 
trary supposition as utterly absurd founding his argu 
ment mainly on the vast velocities which such a suppo 
sition requires us to ascribe to the celestial bodies dr 
gilbert was physician to queen elizabeth and to james 
the first and died in sometime after his death 
the executors of his brother published another work of 
his de mundo nostra stcblunari philosopaia novoy in which 
similar views are still more comprehensively presented 
in this he says the two lords of philosophy aristotle 
and galen are held in worship like gods and mle the 
schools — the former by some destiny obtained a sway 
and influence among philosophers like that of his pupil 
alexander among the kings of the earth — galen with 
like success holds his triumph among the physicians of 
europe this comparison of aristotle to alexander 
was also taken hold of by bacon nor is gilbert an 
unworthy precursor of bacon in the view he givesof the 
history of science which occupies the first three chap 
ters of his philosophy he traces this history from • the 
simplicity and ignorance of the ancients through the 
fabrication of the fable of the four elements to aristotle

and gralen he mentions with due disapproval the host 
of commentators which succeeded the alchemists the 
 shipwreck of science in the deluge of the goths and 
the revival of letters and genius in the time of our 
grandfathers this later age he says has exploded 
the barbarians and restored the greeks and latins to 
their pristine grace and honour it remains that if they 
have written aught in error this should be remedied by 
better and more productive processes frugiferis institu 
tis not to be contemned for their novelty for nothing 
which is true is really new but is perfect from eternity 
though to weak man it may be unknown and that thus 
philosophy may bear her fruit the reader of bacon 
will not fail to recognize in these references to fruit 
bearing knowledge a similarity of expression with the 
novum organon 

bacon does not appear to me to have done justice to 
his contemporary he nowhere recognises in the labours 
of gilbert a community of purpose and spirit with his 
own on the other hand he casts upon him a reflection 
which he by no means deserves in the advancement of 
leaming he says another error is that men have 
used to infect their meditations opinions and doctrines 
with some conceits which they have most admired or 
some sciences to which they have most applied and 
given all things else a tincture according to them utterly 

untrue and nnproper so have the alchemists made a 

philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace 
and gilbertus our countryman hath made a philosophy 
out of the observations of a loadstone in the latin 
philosophiam etiam e magnete elicuit and in the same 
manner he mentions him in the novum organonf as 
affording an example of an empirical kind of philosophy 
which appears to those daily conversant with the experi

ments probable but to other persons incredible and 
empty but instead of blaming gilbert for disturbing 
and narrowing science by a too constant reference to 
roagnetical rules we might rather censure bacon for not 
seeing how important in all natural philosophy are those 
laws of attraction and repulsion of which magnetical phe 
nomena are the most obvious illustration we may find 
ground for such a judgment in another passage in which 
bacon speaks of gilbert in the second book of the 
novum organony having classified motions he gives as 
one kind what he calls in his figurative language motion 
for gain or motion of need by which a body shuns hete 
rogeneous and seeks cognate bodies and he adds 
 the electrical operation concerning which gilbert and 
others since him have made up such a wonderful story 
is nothing else than the appetite of a body which excited 
by friction does not well tolerate the air and prefers 
another tangible body if it be found near bacons 
notion of an appetite in the body is certainly much less 
philosophical than gilberts who speaks of light bodies 
as drawn towards amber by certain material radii f and 
we might perhaps venture to say that bacon here mani 
fests a want of clear mechanical ideas bacon too 
showed his inferior aptitude for physical research in 
rejecting the copemican doctrine which gilbert adopted 
in the advancement of leamingx suggesting a history of 
the opinions of philosophers he says that he would have 
inserted in it even recent theories as those of paracelsus 
of telesius who restored the philosophy of parmenides 
or patricius who resublimed the fumes of platonism 
or gilbert who brought back the dogmas of philolaus 
but bacon quotes with pleasure gilberts ridicule of the 
peripatetics definition of heat they had said that heat

is that whicfh separates heterogeneous and unites homoge 
neous matter which said gilbert is if any one were to 
define man as that which sows wheat and plants vines 

gtilileo another of gilberts distinguished contem 
poraries had a higher opinion of him he says i 
extremely admire and envy this author i think him 
worthy of the greatest praise for the many new and true 
observations which he has made to the disgrace of so 
many vain and febling authors who write not from 
their own knowledge only but repeat everything they 
hear from the foolish and vulgar without attempting to 
satisfy themselves of the same by experience perhaps 
that they may not diminish the size of their books 

croliko — gtilileo was content with the active and 
successful practice of experimental inquiry and did not 
demand that such researches should be made expressly 
subservient to that wider and more ambitious philo 
sophy on which the author of the novum organon 
employed his powers but still it now becomes our 
business to trace those portions of galileos views which 
have reference to the theory as well as the practice 
of scientific investigation on this subject galileo did 
not think more profoundly perhaps than several of his 
contemporaries but in the liveliness of expression and 
illustration with which he recommended his opinions 
on such topics he was unrivalled writing in the lan 
guage of the people in the attractive form of dialogue 
with clearness grace and wit he did far more than 
any of his predecessors had done to render the new 
methods results and prospects of science familiar to a 
wide circle of readers first in italy and soon all over 
europe the principal points inculcated by him were 
already becoming familiar to men of active and inquiring 
minds such as— that knowledge was to be sought from

observation and not from books — that it was absurd to 
adhere to and debate about the physical tenets of aris 
totle and the rest of the ancients on persons who al 
lowed this latter course gleo fixed the epithet of 
paper philosophers because as he wrote in a letter to 
kepler this sort of men fancied that philosophy wad to 
be studied like the jsneid or odyuee and that the true 
reading of nature was to be detected by the coliatihv of 
texts nothing so much shook the authority of the 
received system of physics as the experimental discove 
ries directly contradicting it diich galileo made by 
experiment as i have elsewhere statedf he disproved 
the aristotelian doctrine that bodies fsm quickly or 
slowly in proportion to their weight and when he had 
invented the telescope a number of new discoveries of 
the most striking kind the inequalities of the moons 
surface the spots in the sun the moonlike phases of 
venus the satellites of jupiter the ring of saturn 
showed by the evidence of the eyes how inadequate were 
the conceptions and how erroneous the doctrines of the 
ancients respecting the constitution of the xmiverse 
how severe the blow was to the disciples of the aacient 
schools we may judge by the extraordinary forms of 
defence in which they tried to intrench themselves they 
would not look through galileos glasses they main 
tained that what was seen veas an illusion of witchcraft 
and they tried as galileo sayst with logical arguments 
as if with magical incantations to charm the new planets 
out of the sky no one could be better fitted than 
galileo for such a warfigure his great knowledge clear 
intellect gaiety and light irony with the advantage of 
being in the right enabled him to play vrith his adver 
saries as he pleased thus when an aristotelian j

rejected the disooyery of the irregularities in the moons 
surftuse because according to the ancient doctrine her 
form was a perfect sphere and held that the apparent 
cavities were filled with an invisible crystal substance 
galileo replied that he i no olgection to assent to this 
but that then he diould require his adversary in return 
to believe that there were on the same surfitce invisible 
erystal mountains ten times as high as those visible ones 
which he had actually observed and measured 

we find in galileo many thoughts which have since 
become established maxims of modem philosophy 
 philosophy he says is written in that great book 
i mean the universe which is constantly open before our 
eyes but it cannot be understood except we first know 
the language and learn the characters in which it is 
written with this thought he combines some other 
lively images one of his interlocutors says concerning 
aioler sarsi perhaps thinks that philosophy is a book 
made up of the fiuicies of men like the liiad or orlando 
furiasof in which the matter of least importance is that 
what is written be true and again with regard to the 
system of authority he says i think i discover in him 
a firm belief that in philosophizing it is necessary to 
lean upon the opinion of some celebrated author as if 
our mind must necessarily remain unfruitful and barren 
till it be married to anouier mans reason — no he 
says the case is not so — when we have the decrees of 
nature authority goes for nothing reason is absolutef 

in the course of galileos controversies questions of 
the lgio of science came under discussion vincenzio 
di grasia objected to a proof from induction ivhich 
galileo adduced because au the particulars were not 
enumerated to which the latter justly replies that if 
induction were required to pass through all the cases it

would be either ufleless or impossible— impossible when 
the cases are innumerable useless when they have each 
already been verified since then the general proposition 
adds nothing to our knowledge 

one of the most novel of the characters which science 
assumes in galileos hands is that she becomes caiitious 
she not only proceeds leaning upon experience but die 
is content to proceed a little way at a time she already 
begins to perceive that she must rise to the heights of 
knowledge by many small and separate steps the phi 
losopher is desirous to know much but resigned to be 
ignorant for a time of that which cannot yet be known 
thus when galileo discovered the true law of the motion 
of a falling body that the velocity increases proportion 
ally to the time from the beginning of the fall he did not 
insist upon immediately assigning the cause of this law 
 the cause of the acceleration of the motions of fidling 
bodies is not he says a necessary part of the investi 
gation yet the conception of this acceleration as the 
result of the continued action of the force of gravity upon 
the falling body could hardly fail to suggest itself to one 
who had formed the idea of force in like manner the 
truth that the velocities acquired by bodies calling down 
planes of equal heights are all equal was known to 
galileo and his disciples long before he accounted for 
itf by the principle apparently so obvious that the 
momentum generated is as the moving force which 
generates it he was not tempted to rush at once from 
an experimental truth to a universal system science 
had learnt that she must move step by step and the 
gravity of her pace already indicated her approaching 
maturity and her consciousness of the long path which 
lay before her 

but besides the genuine philosophical prudence which 

• hut ind set ii t lb n

practical befobmebs of science 

thus witheld gralileo from leaping hastily from one infer 
ence to another he had perhaps a preponderating incli 
nation towards facts and did not feel so much as some 
other persons of his time the need of reducing them to 
ideas he could bear to contemplate laws of motion 
without being urged by an uncontrollable desire to refer 
them to conceptions of force 

kepler— in this respect his friend kepler differed 
from him for kepler was restless and unsatisfied till he 
had reduced facts to laws and laws to causes and never 
acquiesced in ignorance though he tested with the most 
rigorous scrutiny that which presented itself in the shape 
of knowledge to fill the void it may be seen in the 
history of astronomy with what perseverance energy 
and fertility of invention kepler pursued his labours 
enlivened and relieved by the most curious freaks of 
fancy with a view of discovering the rules which regulate 
the motions of the planet mars he represents this 
emplojrment under the image of a warre and describesf 
his object to be to triumph ovot mars and to prepare 
for him as for one altogether vanquished tabular prisons 
and equated eccentric fetters and when the enemy 
left at home a despised captive had burst all the chains 
of the equations and broken forth of the prisons of the 
tables — when it was buxzed here and there that the 
victory is vain and that the war is raging anew as vio 
lently as before •— that is when the rules which he had 
proposed did not coincide with the facts — he by no means 
desisted ftom his attempts but suddenly sent into the 
field a reserve of new physical reasonings on the rout 
and dispersion of the veterans that is tried new suppo 
sitions suggested by such views as he then entertained of 
the celestial motions his efforts to obtain the formal

laws of the planetary motiods resulted in some of tke 
most important discoveries ever made in astronomy and 
if bis physical reasonings were for the time fruiueflb this 
arose only from the want of that discipline in mechanical 
ideas which the minds of mathematicians had still to 
undergo for the great discoveries of newton in the 
next generation showed that in reality the next step of 
the advance was in this direction among all keplers 
fantastical expressions the fundamental thoughts were 
sound and true namely that it was his business as a 
physical investigator to discover a mathematical rule 
which governed and included all the special facts and 
that the rules of the motions of the planets must conform 
to some conception of causation 

the same characteristics — the conviction of rule and 
cause perseverance in seeking these inventiveness in 
devising hypotheses love of truth in trying and rejecting 
them and a lively fancy playing with the reason without 
interrupting her — appear also in his work on optics in 
which he tried to discover the exact law of optical refrac 
tion in this undertaking he did not succeed entirely 
nor does he profess to have done so he ends his nume 
rous attempts by saying now reader you and i have 
been detained sufficiently long while i have been attempt 
ing to collect into one fagot the measures of different 
reifractions 

in this and in other expressions we see how clearly 
he apprehended that ccuigation of facts which is the main 
business of the practical discoverer and by his peculiar 
endowments and habits kepler exhibits an essential por 
tion of this process which hardly appears at all in galileo 
in order to bind together facts theory is requisite as well 
as observation — the cord as well as the fitgots and the 
true theory is often if not always obtained by trying

several and selecting the right now of this portion of 
the discoverers exertions kepler is a most conspicuous 
example his fertility in devising suppositions his 
undaunted industry in calculating the results of them 
his entire hcaiesty and candour in resigning them if these 
results disagreed with the facts are a very instructive 
spectacle and are fortunately exhibited to us in the 
most lively manner in his own garrulous narratives 
galileo urged men by precept as well as example to begin 
their philosophy from observation kepler taught them 
by his practice that they must proceed from observation 
by means of hypotheses the one insisted upon facts 
the other dealt no less copiously with ideas in the prac 
tical as in the speculative portion of our history this 
antithesis shows itself although in the practical part we 
cannot have the two elements separated as in the specu 
lative we sometimes have 

in the history of science i have devoted several 
pages to the intellectual character of kepler inasmuch 
as his habit of devising so great a multitude of hypotheses 
so fancifully expressed had led some writers to look upon 
him as an inquirer who transgressed the most fixed rules 
of philosophical inquiry this opinion has arisen i 
conceive among those who have forgotten the necessity 
of ideas as well as facts for all theory or who have 
overlooked the impossibility of selecting and explicating 
our ideas without a good deal of spontaneous play of the 
nund it must however always be recollected that 
keplers genius and fancy derived all their scientific value 
from his genuine and unmingled love of truth these 
qualities appeared not only in the judgment he passed 
upon hypotheses but also in matters which more imme 
diately concerned his reputation thus when galileos 
discovery of the telescope disproved several opinions

which kepler had published and strenuously maintained 
he did not hesitate a moment to retract his assertions 
and range himself by the side of galileo whom he vigo 
rously supported in his warfare against those who were 
incapable of thus cheerfully acknowledgingthe triumph 
of new facts over their old theories 

tycho — there remains one eminent astronomer 
the friend and fellowlabourer of kepler whom we must 
not separate from him as one of the practical reformers 
of science i speak of tycho brahe who is i think not 
justly appreciated by the literary world in general in 
consequence of his having made a retrograde step in that 
portion of astronomical theory which is most familiar to 
the popular mind though he adopted the copemican 
view of the motion of the planets about the sun he 
refused to acknowledge the annual and diurnal motion of 
the earth but notwithstanding this mistake into which 
he was led by his interpretation of scripture rather than 
of nature tycho must ever be one of the greatest names 
in astronomy in the philosophy of science also the 
influence of what he did is far from inconsiderable and 
especially its value in bringing into notice these two 
points that not oioly are observations the beginning of 
science but that the progress of science may often depend 
upon the observers pursuing his task regularly and care 
fully for a long time and with well devised instruments 
and again that observed facts offer a succession of laws 
which we discover as our observations become better and as 
our theories are better adapted to the observations with 
regard to the former point tychos observatory was tkr 
superior to all that had preceded it not only in the 
optical but in the mechanical arrangements a matter of 
almost equal consequence and hence it was that his 
observations inspired in kepler that confidence which led

him to all his labours and all his discoveries since 
he says the divine goodness has given us in tycho 
brahe an exact observer from whose observations this 
rror of eight minutes in the calculations of the ptole 
maic hypothesis is detected let us acknowledge and make 
use of this gift of god and since this error cannot be 
neglected these eight minutes alone have prepared the 
way for an entire reform of astronomy and are to be the 
main subject of this work 

with regard to tychos discoveries respecting the 
moon it is to be recollected that besides the first inequa 
lity of the moons motion the equation of the ventre 
arising from the elliptical form of her orbit ptolemy 
had discovered a second inequality the evection which 
as we have observed in the history of this subjectf 
might have naturally suggested the suspicion that there 
were still other inequalities in the middle ages how 
ever such suggestions implying a constant progress in 
science were little attended to and we have seen that 
when an arabian astronomer had really discovered 
another inequality of the moon it was soon forgotten 
because it had no place in the established systems tycho 
not only rediscovered the lunar inequality the variation 
thus once before won and lost but also two other in 
equalities namely ihqchange of inclination oi the mooii 
orbit as the line of nodes moves round and an inequality 
in the motion of the line of nodes thus as i have else 
where said it appeared that the discovery of a rule is a 
step to the discovery of deviations from that rule which 
require to be expressed in other rules it became mani 
fest to astronomers and through them to all philosophers 
that in the fqplication of theory to observation we find 
not only the stated phenomena for which the theory does 

• de stdl marty p c t hit ind set i 

x ihy i § montucla i b

 review of opinions on knowledge 

account but also residtsal phenomena which are unac 
counted for and remain over and above the calculation 
and it was seen further that these residual phenomena 
might be altogether or in part exhausted by new theories 
these were valuable lessons and the more valuable 
inasmuch as men were now trying to lay down maxims 
and methods for the conduct of science a revolution 
was not only at hand but had really taken place in the 
great body of real cultivators of science the occasion 
now required that this revolution should be formally 
recognized — that the new intellectual power should be 
clothed with the forms of government — that the new 
philosophical republic should be acknowledged as a sister 
state by the ancient dynasties of aristotle and plato 
there was needed some great theoretical reformer to 
speak in the name of the experimental philosophy to 
lay before the world a declaration of its rights and a 
scheme of its laws and thus our eyes are turned to 
francis bacon and others who like him attempted this 
great office we quit those august and venerable names 
of discoverers whose appearance was the prelude and 
announcement of the new state of things then opening 
and in doing so we may apply to them the language 
which bacon applies to himself —

here engaged if we were to content ourselves with 
estimating him according to the oflsce which as we have 
just seen he claims for himself as merely the harbinger 
and announcer of a sounder method of scientific inquiry 
than that which was recognized before him the task 
would be comparatively easy for we might select from 
his writings those passages in which he has delivered 
opinions and pointed out processes then novel and 
strange but since confirmed by the experience of actual 
discoverers and by the judgments of the wisest of suc 
ceeding philosophers and we might pass by without 
disrespect but without notice maxims and proposals which 
have not been found available for use — views so indistinct 
and vague that we are even yet unable to pronounce 
upon their justice — and boundless anticipations dictated 
by the sanguine hopes of a noble and comprehensive 
intellect but if we thus reduce the philosophy of bacon 
to that portion which the subsequent progress of science 
has rigorously verified we shall have to pass over many 
of those declarations which have excited most notice in 
his writings and shall lose sight of many of those striking 
thoughts which his admirers most love to dwell upon 
for he is usually spoken of at least in this country as a 
teacher who not only commenced but in a great measure 
completed the philosophy of induction he is con 
sidered not only as having asserted some general prin 
ciples but laid down the special rules of scientific investi 
gation as not only one of the founders but the supreme 
legislator of the modern republic of science not only 
the hercules who slew the monsters that obstructed the 
earlier traveller but the solon who established a consti

he deserves a share which considering the period at which 
he lived is truly astonishing but it is necessary for us 
in this place to discriminate and select that portion of his 
system which bearing upon physical science has since 
been confirmed by the actual history of science many 
of bacons most impressive and captivating passages con 
template the extension of the new methods of discovering 
truth to intellectual to moral to political as well as to 
physical science and how far and how the advantages

time be a highly interesting task to examine but our 
plan requires us at present to omit the consideration of 
these for our purpose is to learn what the genuine 
course of the formation of science is by tracing it iu 
those portions of human knowledge which by the con 
fession of all are most exact most certain most complete 
hence we must here deny ourselves the dignity and inte 
rest which float about all speculations in which the great 
moral and political concerns of men are involved it 
cannot be doubted that the commanding position which 
bacon occupies in mens estimation arises from his pro 
claiming a reform in philosophy of so comprehensive a 
nature — a reform which was to infuse a new spirit into 
every part of knowledge physical science has tranquilly 
and noiselessly adopted many of his suggestions which 
were indeed her own natural impulses not borrowed from 
him and she is too deeply and satisfactorily absorbed in 
contemplating her results to talk much about the methods 
of obtaining tliem which she has thus instinctively pur 
sued but the philosophy which deals with mind with 
manners with morals with polity is conscious still of 
much obscurity and perplexity and would gladly borrow 
aid from a system in which aid is so confidently promised

fer more frequently quoted by metaphysical ethical and 
even theological writers than they are by the authors of 
works on physics 

 again even as regards physics bacons fame rests 
upon something besides the novelty of the maxims which 
he promulgated that a revolution in the method of 
scientific research was going on all the greatest physical 
investigators of the sixteenth century were fully aware 
as we have shown in the last chapter but their writings 
conveyed this conviction to the public at large somewhat 
slowly men of letters men of the world men of rank 
did not become familiar with the abstruse works in 
which these views were published and above all they 
did not by such occasional glimpses as they took of the 
state of physical science become aware of the magnitude 
and consequences of this change but bacons lofty 
eloquence wide learning comprehensive views bold pic 
tures of the coming state of things were fitted to make 
men turn a far more general and earnest gaze upon the 
passing change when a man of his acquirements of 
his talents of his rank and position of his gravity and 
caution poured forth the strongest and loftiest expres 
sions and images which his mind could supply in order 
to depict the great instauration which he announced 
—in order to contrast the weakness the blindness the 
ignorance the wretchedness under which men had la 
boured while they followed the long beaten track with 
the light the power the privileges which they were to 
find in the paths to which he pointed — it was impossible 
that readers of all classes should not have their attention 
arrested their minds stirred their hopes warmed and 
should not listen with wonder and with pleasure to the 
strains of prophetic eloquence in which so great a subject 
was presented and when it was found that the prophecy 
was verified when it appeared that an immense change

 review of opinions on knowledge 

in the methods of scientific research really had occurred 
— that vast additions to mans knowledge and power had 
been acquired in modes like those which had been spoken 
of — that further advances might be constantly looked 
for — and that a progress seemingly boundless was going 
on in the direction in which the seer had thus pointed 
— it was natural that men should hail him as the leader 
of the revolution that they should identify him with the 
event which he was the first to announce that they iuld 
look upon him as the author of that which he had as they 
perceived so soon and so thoroughly comprehended 

 for we must remark that although as we have 
seen he was not the only nor the earliest writer who 
declared that the time was come for such a change he 
not only proclaimed it more emphatically but understood 
it in its general character much more exactly than aujf 
of his contemporaries among the maxims suggestions 
and anticipations which he threw out there were many 
of which the wisdom and the novelty were alike striking 
to his immediate successors — there are many which 
even now from time to time we find fresh reason to 
admire for their acuteness and justice bacon stands 
far above the herd of loose and visionary speculators who 
before and about his time spoke of the establishment of 
new philosophies if we must select some one philoso 
pher as the hero of the revolution in scientific method 
beyond all doubt francis bacon must occupy the place 
of honour 

we shall however no longer dwell upon these general 
considerations but shall proceed to notice some of the 
more peculiar and characteristic features of bacons phi 
losophy and especially those views which occurring for 
the first time in his writings have been fully illustrated 
and confirmed by the subsequent progress of science and 
have become a portion of the ermanent philosophy of 
our times

fbanciffi bacon 

 i the first great feature which strikes us in 
bacons philosophical views is that which we have already 
noticed — his confident and emphatic announcement of 
a neu era in the progress of science compared with 
which the advances of former times were poor and 
trifling this was with bacon no loose and shallow 
opinion taken up on light grounds and involving only 
vague general notions he had satisfied himself of the 
justice of such a view by a laborious course of research 
and reflection in at the age of twentyeight he 
published his treatise of the advancement of learning in 
which he takes a comprehensive and iirited survey of 
the condition of all branches of knowledge which had 
been cultivated up to that time this work was com 
posed with a view to that reform of the existing philo 
sophy which bacon always had before his eyes and in 
the latin edition of his works forms the first part of 
the instauratio magna in the second part of the 
instauratio the novum organon published in he 
more explicitly and confidently states his expectations on 
this subject he points out how slightly and feebly the 
examination of nature had been pursued up to his time 
and with what scanty fruit he notes the indications of 
this in the very limited knowledge of the greeks who 
had till then been the teachers of europe in the com 
plaints of authors concerning the subtility and obscurity 
of the secrets of nature in the dissensions of sects in the 
absence of useful inventions resulting from theory in the 
fixed form which the sciences had retained for two thou 
sand years nor he adds is this wonderful for how 
little of his thought and labour has man bestowed upon 
science out of twentyfive centuries scarce six have 
been favourable to the progiess of knowledge and even 
in those favoured times natural philosophy received the 

 lib i aphor et seq 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 review of opinions on knowledge 

smallest share of mans attention while the portion so 
given was marred by controversy and dogmatism and even 
those who have bestowed a little thought upon this philo 
sophy have never made it their main study but have used 
it as a passage or drawbridge to serve other objects and 
thus he says the great mother of the sciences is thrust 
down with indignity to the offices of a handmaid is 
made to minister to the labours of medicine or mathema 
tics or to give the first preparatory tinge to the immature 
minds of youth from these and similar considerations 
of the errors of past time he draws hope for the future 
employing the same argument which demosthenes uses 
to the athenians that which is worst in the events 
of the past is the best as a ground of trust in the future 
for if you had done all that became you and still had 
been in this condition your case might be desperate but 
since your failure is the result of your own mistakes 
there is good hope that correcting the error of your 
course you may reach a prosperity yet unknown to 
you 

 ii all bacons hope of improvement indeed was 
placed in an entire change of the method by which science 
was pursued and the boldness and at the same time 
the then existing state of science being considered the 
definiteness of his views of the change that was requisite 
are truly remarkable 

that all knowledge must begin with observation is 
one great principle of bacons philosophy but i hardly 
think it necessary to notice the inculcation of this maxim 
as one of his main services to the cause of sound know 
ledge since it had as we have seen been fully insisted 
upon by others before him and was growing rapidly into 
general acceptance without his aid but if he was not 
the first to tell men that they must collect their know 
ledge from observation he had no rival in his peculiar

francis bacon 

office of teaching them how science must thus be gathered 
from experience 

it appears to me that by r the most extraordinary 
parts of bacons works are those in which with extreme 
earnestness and clearness he insists upon a graduated and 
successive induction as opposed to a hasty transit from 
special facts to the highest generalizations the nine 
teenth axiom of the first book of the novum organon 
contains a view of the nature of true science most exact 
and profound and so r as i am aware at the time 
perfectly new there are two ways and can only be 
two of seeking and finding truth the one from sense 
and particulars takes a flight to the most general axioms 
and from those principles and their truth settled once for 
all invents and judges of intermediate axioms the 
other method collects axioms from sense and particulars 
ascending continuouslt and by degrees so that in the end 
it arrives at the most general axioms this latter way is 
the true one but hitherto untried 

it is to be remarked that in this passage bacon em 
ploys the term ojrioms to express any propositions collected 
from facts by induction and thus fitted to become the 
startingpoint of deductive reasonings how far propo 
sitions so obtained may approach to the character of 
axioms in the more rigorous sense of the term we have 
already in some measure examined but that question does 
not here immediately concern us the truly remarkable 
circumstance is to find this recommendation of a con 
tinuous advance from observation by limited steps through 
successive gradations of generality given at a time when 
speculative men in general had only just begun to perceive 
that they must begin their course from experience in 
some way or other how exactly this description repre 
sents the general structure of the soundest and most 
comprehensive physical theories all persons who have

 keview of opinionb on knowledge 

studied the progress of science up to modern times can 
bear testimony but perhaps this structure of science 
cannot in any other way be made so apparent as by those 
tables of successive generalizations in which we have exhi 
bited the history and constitution of some of the principal 
physical sciences in the chapter of the preceding book 
which treats of the logic of induction and the view 
which bacon thus took of the true progress of science 
was not only new but so far as i am aware has never 
been adequately illustrated up to the present day 

 it is true as i observed in the last chapter that 
galileo had been led to see the necessity not only of 
proceeding from experience in the pursuit of knowledge 
but of proceeding cautiously and gradually and he had 
exemplified this rule more than once when having made 
one step in discovery he held back his foot for a time 
from the next step however tempting but galileo had 
not reached this wide and commanding view of the suc 
cessive subordination of many steps all leading up at 
last to some wide and simple general truth in catching 
sight of this principle and in ascribing to it its due 
importance bacons sagacity so far as i am aware wrought 
unassisted and unrivalled 

 nor is there any wavering or vagueness in bacons 
assertion of this important truth he repeats it over and 
over again illustrates it by a great number of the most 
lively metaphors and emphatic expressions thus he 
speaks of the successive flows tabtdata of induction 
and speaks of each science as a pyramid which has obser 
vation and experience for its basis no images can better

exhibit the relation of general and particular truths as 
our own inductive tables may serve to show 

 iiio again not less remarkable is his contrasting 
this true method of science while it was almost as he 
says yet untried with the ancient and vicious metlhod 
which began indeed with facts of observation but rushed 
at once and with no gradations to the most general 
principles for this was the course which had been 
actually followed by all those speculative reformers who 
had talked so loudly of the necessity of beginning our 
philosophy from experience all these men if they 
attempted to frame physical doctrines at all had caught 
up a few facts of observation and had erected a universal 
theory upon the suggestions which these ofltered this 
process of illicit generalization or as bacon terms it 
anticipation of nature anticipatio naturce in opposition 
to the interpretation of nature he depicts with singular 
acuteness in its character and causes these two ways 
he says f both begin from sense and particulars but 
their discrepancy is immense the one merely skims 
over experience and particulars in a cursory transit the 
other deals with them in a due and orderly manner the 
one at its very outset frames certain general abstract 
principles but useless the other gradually rises to those 
principles which have a real existence in nature 

the former path he addst that of illicit and 
hasty generalization is one which the intellect follows 
when abandoned to its own impulse and this it does 
from the requisitions of logic for the mind has a yearn 
ing which makes it dart forth to generalities that it may 
have something to rest in and after a little dallying with 
experience becomes weary of it and all these evils are 
augmented by logic which requires these generalities to 
make a show vnth in its disputations

 in a sober patient grave intellect lie further adds 
 the mind by its own impulse and more especially if 
it be not impeded by the sway of established opinions 
attempts in some measure that other and toue way of 
gradual generalization but this it does with small profit 
for the intellect except it be regulated and aided is a 
faculty of unequal operation and altogether unapt to 
master the obscurity of things 

the profound and searching wisdom of these remarks 
appears more and more as we apply them to the various 
attempts which men have made to obtain knowledge when 
they begin with the contemplation of a few facts and pur 
sue their speculations as upon most subjects they have 
hitherto generally done for almost all such attempts have 
led immediately to some process of illicit generalization 
which introduces an interminable course of controversy in 
the physical sciences however we have the further ines 
timable advantage of seeing the other side of the contrast 
exemplified for many of them as our inductive tables 
show us have gone on according to the most rigorous 
conditions of gradual and successive generalization and 
in consequence of this circumstance in their constitution 
possess in each part of their structure a solid truth 
which is always ready to stand the severest tests of rea 
soning and experiment 

we see how justly and clearly bacon judged con 
cerning the mode in which facts are to be employed in 
the construction of science this indeed has ever been 
deemed his great merit insomuch that many persons ap 
pear to apprehend the main substance of his doctrine to 
reside in the maxim that facts of observation and such 
facts alone are the essential elements of all true science 

 iv yet we have endeavoured to establish the 
doctrine that facts are but one of two ingredients of 
knowledge both equauy necessary — that ideas are no 



digitized by vjooq ic 



francis bacon 

less indispensable than fiacts themselves and that except 
these be duly unfolded and applied facts are collected in 
vain has bacon then neglected this great portion of 
his subject has he been led by some partiality of view 
or some peculiarity of circumstances to leave this curious 
and essential element of science in its pristine obscurity 
was he unaware of its interest and importance 

we may reply that bacons philosophy in its effect 
upon his readers in general does not give due weight or 
due attention to the ideal element of our knowledge 
he is considered as peculiarly and eminently the asserter 
of the value of experiment and observation he is always 
understood to belong to the experiential as opposed to 
the ideal school he is held up in contrast to plato and 
others who love to dwell upon that part of knowledge 
which has its origin in the intellect of man 

 nor can it be denied that bacon has in the 
finished part of his novum organum put prominently 
forwards the necessary dependence of all our knowledge 
upon experience and said little of its dependence equally 
necessary upon the conceptions which the intellect itself 
supplies it will appear however on a close examination 
that he was by no means insensible or careless of this 
internal element of all connected speculation he held 
the balance with no partial or feeble hand between 
phenomena and ideas he urged the colligation of 
facts but he was not the less aware of the value of the 
explication of conceptions 

 this appears plainly from some remarkable apho 
risms in the novum organum thus in noticing the 
causes of the little progress then made by science he 
states this — in the current notions all is unsound 
whether they be logical or physical substance quality 
action passion even beings are not good conceptions still 
less are heavjy lights dense rare moist dry generatior

are vague and illdefined notions notiones im nee bene

be completed there is not so far as i have notieed any 
attempt to fix and define any notions thus oomplaiaed of 
as loose and obscure but yet such an undertaking ap 
pears to have formed part of his plan and in the abeee 
darium nature which consists of the heads of various 
portions of his great scheme marked by letters of the 
alphabet we find the titles of a series of dissertations 
 on the conditions of beings which must have had for 
their object the elucidation of divers notions essential to 
science and which would have been contributions to the 
explication of conceptions such as we have attempted 
in a former part of this work thus some of the sdbrjects 
of these dissertations are — of much and little f 
durable and transitory — of natural and monstrous — • 
of natural and artificial when the philosopher of 
induction came to discuss these considered as condihom 
of eanstencej he could not do other than develop limit 
methodize and define the ideas involved in these notions 
so as to make them consistent with themselvesi and a fit 
basis of demonstrative reasoning his task would have 
been of the same nature as ours has been in that part of 
this work which treats of the fundamental ideas of the 
various classes of sciences 

 thus bacon in his speculative philosophy took 
firmly hold of both the handles of science and if he had 
completed his scheme would probably have given due

t mag par iii vol viil p

francis bacon 

attention to ideas no less than to facts as an ielement 
of onr knowledge while in his view of the general 
method of asoending from cts to principles he displayed 
a sagacity truly wonderful but wd cannot be surprised 
that in attempting to exemplify the method which he 
recommended he should have failed for the method 
could be eznplified only by some important discovery 
in physical science and great discoveries even with the 
most perfect methods do not come at command more 
over although the general structure of his scheme was 
correct the precise import of some of its details could 
hardly be understood till the actual progress of science 
had made men somewhat familiar with the kind of steps 
which it included 

 v accordingly bacons inquisition into the 
nature of heat which is given in the second book of 
the novum organon as an example of the mode of inter 
rogating nature cannot be looked upon otherwise than 
as a complete failure this will be evident if we con 
sider that although the exact nature of heat is still an 
obscure and controverted matter the science of heat 
now consists of many important truths and that to none 
of these truths is there any approximation in bacons 
essay from his process he arrives at this as the forma 
or true definition of heat — that it is an expansive 
restrained motion modified in certain ways and exerted in 
the smaller particles of the body but the steps by which 
the science of heat really advanced were as may be seen 
in the history of the subject these — the discovery 
of a measure of heat or temperature the thermometer 
the establishment of the laws of conduction and radia 
tion of the hms of specific heat latent heat and the 
like such steps have led to amperes hypothesis f that 
heat consists in the vibrations of an imponderable fluid 

 hiit ind sci ii t lb

and to laplaces htpothesi that temperature consists in 
the internal radiation t such a fluid ttiese hypotheses 
eannot yet be said to be even probable but at least they 
are so modified as to indude some of the preceding laws 
which are firmly established mliereas bacons hypo 
thetical motion includes no laws of phehomena esplain 
no process and is indeed itself an example of illicit 
generalisation 

 one main ground of bacons ill fortune in this 
undertaking appears to be that he was not aware of an 
important maxim of inductive science that we must first 
obtain the measure and aaffeertain the hws of phenomena 
before we endvour to discover their eenises the whole 
history of thermotics up to the present time has been 
occupiied with the former step and the task is not yet 
completed it is no wonder therefore that bacon fistiled 
entirely when he so prematurely attempted the seconds 
his sagacity had taught him that the progress of science 
must be gradual but it had not led him to judge ade 
quately how gradual it must be nor of what different 
kinds of inquiries taken in due order it must needs con 
sist in order to obtain success 

another mistake which could not fail to render it 
unlikely that baoon should really exemplify his precepts 
by iany actual advance in science was that he did not 
justly appreciate the sagacity the invehtiye genius which 
all discovery requires he coned ved that he could 
supersede the necessity of such peculiar endowments 
• our method of discovery in science he says ••is of 
such a nature that there is not much left to acuteness 
and strength of genius but all degrees of genius and 
intellect are brought nearly to the same level and he 
illustrates this by comparing his method to a pair of 
compasses by iheans of which a person with no manual 
skill may draw a perfect circle in the same spirit he

iqpeaks of proceeding by due rejeetums and qipears to 
imagine that when we have obtained a collection of facts 
if we go on succeisltely rejecting what is ialse we shall 
at last find that we have left in pnr hands that scientific 
thith which we seek i need not observe how far this 
view is rmnoved from the real state of the case the 
necessity of a cmeephon which mnst be furnished by the 
mind in order to bind together the foots conld hardly 
have escaped die ejre of bacon if he had cultivated more 
carefully the ideal side of his own philosophy and any 
attempts which he coidd have made to construct such 
conceptions by tiiere rule and imethod must have ended 
in convincing him that nothing but a peculiar inventive 
talent could supply that which was thus not contained in 
tiie £emts and yet was needed for the discovery 

 vl since bacon with all his acuteness had 
not divined droumstances so important in the formation 
of science it is not wonderful that his attempt to reduce 
this process to a teehnicd form is of little value in 
tiie first place he says we must prepare a natural and 
expmental history good and snlbscient in the next 
place the instances thus collected are to be arranged in 
tables in some orderly way and then we must apply a 
legitimate and true induction and in his examplef he 
first cects a great number of cases in which heat 
appears under various circumstances which he calls a 
must of instances before the intellect comparentia 
iiutantiarum ad inteuectum or a tme o the presence of 
the thing sought he then adds a table of its absence 
in proitimate cases containing instances where heat does 
not appear then a table of degrees in which it appears 
with greater or less intensity he then addst that we 
must try to exclude several obvious suppositions which

he does by reference to some of the instances he has col 
lected and this step he calls the escbmve or the rejectum 
of natures he then observes and justly that whereas 
truth emerges more easily from error than from confusion 
we may after this preparation give play to the intellect 
fiat permissio intellectus and make an attempt at 
induction liable afterwards to be corrected and by thir 
step which he terms his first vindemiation or inchoate 
induction he is led to th proposition concerning heat 
which we have stated above 

 in all the details of his example he is unfortunate 
by proposing to himself to examine at once into the 
nature of heat instead of the laws of special classes of 
phenomena he makes as we have said a fundamental 
mistake which is the less surprising since he had befora 
him so few examples of the right course in the previous 
history of scienccf but further his collection of instances 
is very loosely brought together for he includes in his list 
the hot taste of aromatic plants the caustic effects of acidg 
and many other facts which cannot be ascribed to heat 
without a studious laxity in the use of the word and 
when he comes to that point where he permits his intellect 
its range the conception of motion upon which it at once 
fastens appears to be selected with little choice or skill 
the suggestion being taken from flame boiling liquids f 
blovn fire and some other cases if from such examples 
we could imagine heat to be motion we ought at least 
to have some gradation to cases of heat where no motion 
is visible as in a redhot iron it would seem that after 
a large collection of instances had been looked at the 
intellect even in its first attempts ought not to havq 
dwelt upon such an hypothesis as this 

 after these steps bacon speaks of several classes 
of instances which singling them out of the general and 

 page

francis bacon 

indiscriminate collection of facts he terms instances with 
prerogative and these he points out as peculiar aids and 
guides to the intellect in its task these instances with 
prerogative have generally been much dwelt upon by 
those who have commented on the novum organdn yet 
in reality such a classification as has been observed 
by one of the ablest writers of the present day is of 
little service in the task of induction for the instances 
are for the most part classed not according to the ideas 
which they involve or to any obvious circumstance in the 
facts of which they consist but according to the extent 
or manner of their influence upon the inquiry in which 
they are employed thus we have solitary instances 
migrating instances ostensive instances clandestine 
instances so termed according to the degree in which 
they exhibit or seem to exhibit the property whose 
nature we would examine we have guidepost in 
stances instanticb crucisy instances of the parted road 
of the doorway of the lamp according to the guidance 
they supply to our advance such a classification is much 
of the same nature as if having to teach the art of build 
ing we were to describe tools with reference to the 
amount and place of the work which they must do 
instead of pointing out their construction and use — as if 
we were to inform the pupil that we must have tools for 
lifting a stone up tools for moving it sideways tools for 
laying it square tools for cementing it firmly such an 
enumeration of ends would convey little instruction as 
to the means moreover many of bacons classes of 
instances are vitiated by the assumption that the form 
that is the general law and cause of the property which 
is the subject of investigation is to be looked for directly 
in the instances which as we have seen in his inquiry 
concerning heat is a fundamental error

 yet liis phraseology in some casds as in the instant 
tia cnmsi serves well to mark the place which certain 
experiments how in our reasonings and many of the 
special examples which he gives are full of acuteness and 
sagacity thus he suggests swinging a pendulum in a 
mine in order to determine whether the attraction of the 
earth arises from the attraction of its parts and observing 
the tide at the same moment in different parts of the worh 
in order to ascertain whether the motion of the water 
expansive or progressive with other ingenious proposals 
these marks of genius may serve to counterbalance the 
unfavourable judgment of bacons aptitude for physical 
science which we are sometimes tempted to form in con 
sequence of his false views on other points as his rejec 
tion of the copemicau system and his undervaluing 
gilberts magnetical speculations most of these errorp 
arose from a too ambitious habit of intellect which 
would not be contented with any except very vrtde and 
general truths and from an indistinctness of mechanical 
and perhaps in general of mathematical ideas defects 
which bacons own philosophy was directed to remedy 
and which in the progress of time it has remedied ia 
others 

 vii having thus freely given our judgment 
concerning the most exact and definite portion of bacons 
precepts it cannot be necessary for us to discuss at any 
length the value of those more vague and general waru 
ings against prejudice and partiality against intellectual 
indolence and presumption with which his works abounds 
his advice and exhortations of this kind are always ex 
pressed with energy and point often clothed iq the hap 
piest fonns of imagery and hence it has come to pass 
that such passages are perhaps more familiar to the

hkre to do with those subjects in which prejudice and 
partiality exerci their peculiar sway questions of 
politics and morals of manners taste or history cannot 
be subjected to a scheme of rigorous induction and 
though on such matters we venture to assert general 
principles these are commonly obtained with some degree 
of insecurity and depend upon special habits of thought 
not upon mere logical connexion here therefore the 
intellect may be perverted by mixing with the pure 
reason our gregarious affections or our individual propen 
sities the false suggestions involved in language or the 
imposing delusions of received theories in these dim 
and complex labyrinths of human thought ffie idol of the 
tribcy or of the den of the forum or of the theatre may 
occupy mens minds with delusive shapes and may obscure 
or pervert their vision of truth but in that natural phi 
losophy with which we are here concerned there is littl 
opportunity for such influences as far as a physical 
theory is completed through air the steps of a just induc 
tion there is a clear daylight diffused over it which leaves 
no lurkingplace for prejudice each part can be exa 
mined separately and repeatedly and the theory is not 
to be deemed perfect till it will bear the scrutiny of all 
sound minds alike although therefore bacon by 
warning men against the idols or fallacious images above 
spoken of may have guarded them from dangerous error 
his precepts have little to do with natural philosophy 
and we cannpt agree with him when he says that the 
doctrine concerning these idols bears the satne relation 
to the interpretation of nature as the doctrine concerning 
sophistical paralogisms bears to common logic

bacons speculations which we must not omit to notice 
it is a leading and constant object vith him to apply his

of his philosophy is his owni ascendendo ad €uimmat€i

t aphorism of the nomtm organon and runs through 
the work man the minister and interpreter of natore 
does and understands so r as he has in fact or in 
thought observed the course of nature and he cannot 
know or do more than this it is not necessary for us 
to dwell much upon this turn of mind for the whole of 
our present inquiry goes upon the supposition that an 
acquaintance with the laws of nature is worth our having 
for its own sake it may be universally tru that know 
ledge is power but we have to do with it not as power 
but as knowledge it is the formation of science not of 
art with which we are here concerned it may give a 
peculiar interest to the history of science to show how it 
constantly tends to provide better and better for the 
wants and comforts of the body but that is not the in 
terest which engages us in our present inquiry into the 
nature and course of philosophy the consideration of 
the means which promote mans material wellbeing 
often appears to be invested with a kind of dignity by 
the discovery of general laws which it involves and the 
satisction which rises in our minds at uie contnpla 
tion of such cases men sometimes ascribe with a false 
ingenuity to the love of mere bodily enjoyment but it 
is never difficult to see that this baser and coarser element 
is not the real source of our admiration those who 
hold that it is the main business of science to construct 
instruments for the uses of life appear sometimes to be 
willing to accept the consequence which follows from

moh a doctrine that the fest shoemaker was a philoso 
pher worthy of the highest admiration but those who 
maintain sttch paradoxes often by a happy inconsistency 
make it their own aim not to deyise some improted 
covering for the feet but to dekght the mind with acute 
ieculaton exhibited in all the graces of wit and £euicy 

it has been saidf that the key of the baconian doc 
triiie consists in two words utility and progress with 
regard to the latter point we have already seen that the 
hope and prospect of a boundless progress in human 
knowledge had sprung up in mens minds even in the 
early times of imperial ilome and were most emphati 
dly expressed by that very seneca who disdained to 
reckon the worth of knowledge by its value in food and 
clothing and when we say that utility was the great 
bodiness of bacons philosophy we forget onehalf of his 
eharaeteristic phrase ascendendo ad axiomata no 
less than descendendo ad opera was he repeatedly 
declared the scheme of his path he constantly spoke 
we are told by his secretary of two kinds of experi 
ments earperimentaruetifera and eaerimenta itcdfera 

again when we are told by modern writers that 
bacon merely recommended such induction as all men 
iubtinctively practise we ought to recollect his own 
earnest and incessant declarations to the contrary the 
induction hitherto practised is he says of no use for ob 
taitting solid science there are two ways j hoec via in

this method must be rejected if we would obtltiq true 
knowledge we shall then at length have ground of 
good hope for science when we proceed in another man 
ner we must rise not bj a leap but bj small step 
by successive advances by a gradation of ascents tryhif 
our facts and clearing our notions at every interval the 
scheme of true philosophy according to bacon is not 
obvious and simple but long and technical requiring 
constant care and selfdenial to follow it and we have 
seen that in this opinion his judgment is confirmed by 
the iadt history and present condition of science 

again it is by no means a just view of bacons cha 
racter to place him in contrast to plato platos philo 
sophy was the philosophy of ideas but it was not left 
for bacon to set up the philosophy of facts in opposition 
to that of ideas that had been done fully by the spe 
culative reformers of the sixteenth century bacon had 
the merit of showing that facts and ideas must becom 
bined and not only so but of divining many of the spe 
cial rules and forms of this combination when as yet 
there were no examples of them with a sagacity hitherto 
quite unparalleled 

 ix with bacons unhappy political life we 
have here nothing to do but we cannot but notice with 
pleasure how faithfully how perseveringly how energeu 
cally he discharged his great philosophical oflsice of a 
reformer of methods he had conceived the purpose of 
making this his object at an early period when medi 
tating the continuation of his novum hgcmon and speak

completeness of effect he saysf i am by two arguments

chapter xii 
prom bacon to newton 

i hcervey — we have already seen that bacon was 
rj no means the first mover or principal author of the 
revolution in the method of philosophixing which todc 
place in his time but onlj the writer who proclaimed in 
the most impressive and comtrehensive manner the 
scheme the profit the dignity and the prospects of the 
new philosophy those therefore who after him took 
tip the same views are not to be considered as his succes 
sors but as his fellow labourers and the line of historical 
succession of opinions must be pursued without special 
reference to any one leading character as the principal 
figure of the epoch i resume this line by noticing a 
contemporary and fellow countryman of bacon harvey 
the discoverer of the circulation of the blood has dis 
covery was not published and generally accepted till near 
the end of bacons life but the anatomists refleetiont on 
the method of pursuing science though strongly marked 
with the character of the revolution that was taking 
place belong to a very different school from the chan 
oellors harvey was a pupil of fabricius of aequapen 
dente whom we noticed among the practical reformers 
of the sixteenth century he entertained like his mas 
f er a strong reverence for the great names which had 
ruled in philosophy up to that time aristotle imd galen 
and was disposed rather to recommend his own method 
by exhibiting it as the true interpretation of ancient 
wisdom than to boast of its novelty it is true that he 
assigns as his reason for publishing some of his researches 
 that by revealing the method i use in searching into

things i might propose to studious men a new and if i 
mistake not a surer path to the attainment of know 
ledge but he soon proceeds to fortifj himself with the 
autjioritj of aristotle in doing this however he has 
the very great merit of giving a living and practical eha 
raeter to truths which exist in the aristotelian works but 
which had hitherto been barren and emptj professions 
we have seen that aristotle had asserted the importance 
 experience as one root of knowledge and in this had 
been followed by the schoolmen of the middle ages but 
this assertion came with very different force and efiect 
from a man the whole of whose life had been spent in 
obtaining by means of ezperiebce knowledge which no 
man had possessed before in harveys general reflect 
tions the necessity of both the elements of knowledge 
sensations and ideas experience and reason is fully 
brought into view and rightly connected with the meta 
phydcs of aristotle he puts the antithesis of these two 
elements with great clearness universals are chiefly 
known to us for science is begot by reasoning from 

 he used similar expressions in conversation george ent who 
edited his generation of animals visited him at that time residing 
not far from the city and found him very intent upon the perscruta 
tion of natures works and with a countenance as cheerful as mind 
imperturbedi democritus like chiefly searching into the cause of 
natural things in the course of conversation the writer said it 
hath always heen your choice about the secrets of nature to oonsuh 
nature herself tis true replied he and i have constantly been 
of opinion that from thence we might acquire not only the knowledge of 
those less considerable secrets of nature but even a certain admiration 
of that supreme essence the creator and though i have ever been 
iady to acknowledge that many things have been discovered by 
ifamed men of former times yet do i still believe that the number of 
those which remain yet conceited in the darkness of impervestigable 
nature is much greater nay i cannot forbear to wonder and some 
times smile at those who persuade themselves that all things were so 
consummately and absolutely delivered by aristotle galen or some 
other great name as that nothing was left to the superaddition of

universals to particulars yet that very comprehension of 
universale in the understanding springs from the percep 
tion of singulars in our sense again he quotes aris 
totles apparently opposite assertions — that made in his 
pktsics that we must advance from things which are 
first known to us tliough confusedly to things more dis 
tinctly intelligible in themselves from the whole to the 
part from the universal to the particular and that 
made in the analyticsf that singulars are more known 
to us and do first exist according to sense for nothing id 
in the understanding which was not before in the sense 
both he says are true though at first they seem to 
clash for though in knowledge we begin with sense 
sensation itself is a universal thing this he further 
illustrates and quotes seneca who says that art 
itself is nothing but the reason of the work implanted in 
the artistes mind and adds the same way by which 
we gain an art by the very same way we attain any kind 
of science or knowledge whatever for as art is a habit 
whose object is something to be done so science is a 
habit whose object is something to be known and as the 
former proceedeth from the imitation of examples so 
this latter from the knowledge of things natural the 
source of both is from sense and experience since but 
it is impossible that art should be rightly purchased by 
the one or science by the other without a direction from 
ideas without here dwelling on the relation of art 
and science very justly stated by harvey except that 
ideas exist in a very different form in the mind of the 
artist and the scientist it will be seen that this doctrine 
of science springing from experience with a direction 
from ideas is exactly that which we have repeatedly 
urged as the true view of the subject from this view 
harvey proceeds to infer the importance of a reference

to sense in his own subject not only for first discovering 
but for receiving knowledge without experience not 
other mens but our own no man is a proper disciple of 
any part of natural knowledge without experimental 
skill in anatomy he will no better apprehend what i 
shall deliver concerning generation than a man born 
blind can judge of the nature and difference of colours 
or one bom deaf of sounds if we do otherwise we 
may get a humid and floating opinion but never a solid 
and infallible knowledge as is happenable to those who 
see foreign countries only in maps and the bowels of 
men falsely described in anatomical tables and hence 
it comes about that in this rank age we have many 
sophisters and bookwrights but few wise men and philo 
sophers he had before declared how unsafe and 
degenerate a thing it is to be tutored by other mens 
commentaries without making trial of the things them 
selves especially since natures book is so open and 
legible we are here reminded of galileos condemna 
tion of the paper philosophers the train of thought 
thus expressed by the practical discoverers spread rapidly 
with the spread of the new knowledge that had suggested 
it and soon became general and unquestioned 

ii descartes — such opinions are now among the 
most familiar and popular of those which are current 
among writers and speakers but we should err much if 
we were to imagine that after they were once propounded 
they were never resisted or contradicted indeed even 
in our own time not only are such maxims very fre 
quently practically neglected or forgotten but the oppo 
site opinions and views of science quite inconsistent with 
those we have been explaining are often promulgated 
and widely accepted the philosophy of pure ideas has 
its commonplaces as well as the philosophy of experience

sopky no lesi than the latter bad its great asserter and 
expounder a man in his own time more admired than 
baoom regarded with more deference by a large body of 
dlsoiples all over europe and more powerful in stirring 
mp mens minds to a new activity of inqniiy i speak of 
descartes whose labours considered as a philosophical 
system were an endeavour to revive the method of ob 
talning knowledge by reasoning from our own ideas only 
and to erect it in opposition to the method of observation 
and experiment the cartesian philosophy contained an 
attempt at a counterrevolution thus in this authors 
prineipia philosaphirb he says that he will give a 
short account of the principal phenomena of the world 
not that he may use them as reasons to prove anything 
for adds he we desire to deduce effects from causes 
not causes from effects but only in order that out of the 
innumerable effects which we learn to be capable of re 
sulting from the same causes we may determine our 
mind to consider some rather than others he had 
before said the principles which we have obtained by 
pure it priori reasoning are so vast and so fruitful that 
many more consequences follow from them than we see 
contained in this visible worid and even many more than 
our mind can ever take a full survey of and be pro 
fesses to apply this method in detail thus in attempt 
ing to state the three ftmdamental laws of motion he 
employs only d priori reasonings and is in fact led into 
error in the third law which he thus obtainsf and in 
his dioptricsx he pretends to deduce the laws of reflec 
tion and refraction of light from certain comparisons 
which are in truth arbitrary in which the radiation of 
kght is represented by the motion of a ball impinging 
upon the reflecting or refracting body it might be 
represented as a curious instance of the caprice of fortune

which appears in scientific as in other history that kep 
ler professing to derive all his knowledge from experi 
ence and exerting himself with the greatest energy and 
perseverance failed in detecting the law of refraction 
while descartes who professed to be able to despise 
experiment obtained the tme law of sines bat as we 
have stated in the history descartes appears to have 
learnt this law from snelps papers and whether this 
be so or not it is certain that notwithstanding the pro 
fession of independence which his philosophy made i 
was in reality constantly guided and instrocted by expe 
rience thns in explaining the rainbow in which his 
portion of the discovery merits great praise he speaksf 
of taking a globe of glass allowing the sun to shine on 
one side of it and noting the colours produced by rays 
after two refractions and one reflection and in many 
other instances indeed in all that relates to physics the 
reasonings and explanations of descartes and his fd 
lowers were consciously or unconsciously directed by 
the known facts which they had observed themselves or 
learnt from others 

but since descartes thus iculatively at least set 
himself in opposition to the great reform of scientific 
method which was going on in his time how it may be 
asked did he acquire so strong an influence over the 
most active minds of his time how is it that he be 
came the founder of a large and distinguished school of 
philosophers how is it that he not only was mainly 
instrumental in deposing aristotle from his intellectual 
throne but for a time appeared to have established hinfr 
self with almost equal powers and to have rendered the 
cartesian school as firm a body as the peripatetic bad 
been

the causes to be assigned for this remarkable result 
are i eonceive the following in the first place the 
physicists of the cartesian school did as i have just 
stated found their philosophy upon experiment and did 
not practically nor indeed most of them theoretically 
assent to their masters boast of showing what the phe 
nomena must be instead of looking to see what they are 
and as descartes had really incorporated in his philo 
sophy all the chief physical discoveries of his own and 
preceding times and had delivered in a more general and 
systematic shape than any one before him the principles 
which he thiis established the physical philosophy of his 
school was in reality far the best then current and was 
an immense improvement upon the aristotelian doctrines 
which had not yet been displaced as a system another 
circumstance which gained him much favour was the 
bold and ostentatious manner in which he professed to 
begin his philosophy by liberating himself from all pre 
conceived prejudice the first sentence of his philo 
sophy contains this celebrated declaration since he 
says we begin life as infants and have contracted 
various judgments concerning sensible things before we 
possess the entire use of our reason we are turned aside 
from the knowledge of truth by many prejudices from 
which it does not appear that we can be any otherwise 
delivered than if once in our life we make it our business 
to doubt of everything in which we discern tlie smallest 
suspicion of uncertainty with this sweeping rejection 
or unhesitating scrutiny of all preconceived opinions the 
power of the ancient authorities and masters in philo 
sophy must obviously shrink away and thus descartes 
came to be considered as the great hero of the overthrow 
of the aristotelian dogmatism but in addition to these 
causes and perhaps more powerful than all in procuring 
the assent of men to his doctrines came the deductive and 



digitized by vjooq ic 



from bacon to newton 

systematic character of his philosophy for although 
all knowledge of the external world is in reality only 
to be obtained from observation by inductive step 
minute perhaps and slow and many as galileo and 
bacon had already taught — the human mind conforms 
to these conditions reluctantly and unsteadily and is ever 
ready to rush to general principles and then to employ 
itself in deducing conclusions from these by synthetical 
reasonings a task grateful from the distinctness and 
certainty of the result and the accompanying feeling of 
our own sufficiency hence men readily overlooked the 
precarious character of descartes fundamental assump 
tions in their admiration of the skill with which a varied 
and complex universe was evolved out of them and 
the complete and systematic character of this philosophy 
attracted men no less than its logical connexion i may 
quote here what a philosopher of our own time has 
said of another writer he owed his influence to various 
causes at the head of which may be placed that genius 
for system which though it cramps the growth of know 
ledge perhaps finally atones for that mischief by the zeal 
and activity which it rouses among followers and oppo 
nents who discover truth by accident when in pursuit of 
weapons for their warfare a system which attempts a 
task so hard as that of subjecting vast provinces of human 
knowledge to one or two principles if it presents some 
striking instances of conformity to superficial appearance 
is sure to delight the framer and for a time to subdue 
and captivate the student too entirely for sober reflection 
and rigorous examination in the first instance consist 
ency passes for truth when principles in some instances 
have proved sufficient to give an unexpected explanation 
of facts the delighted reader is content to accept as 
true all other deductions from the principles specious

premises being assumed to be true nothing more can be 
required than logical inference mathematical forms 
pass current as the equivalent of mathematical certainty 
the unwarj admirer is satisfied with the completeness 
and symmetry of the plan of his house unmindful of the 
need of examining the firmness of the foundation and the 
soundness of the materials the systemmaker like the 
conqueror long dazzles and overawes the world but 
when their sway is past the vulgar herd unable to 
measure their astonishing fitculties take revenge by 
trampling on fallen greatness bacon had showed his 
wisdom in his reflections on this subject when he said 
that method carrying a show of total and perfect 
knowledge hath a tendency to generate acquiescence 

the main value of descartes physical doctrines con 
sisted in their being arrived at in a way inconsistent with 
his own professed method namely by a reference to 
observation but though he did in reality begin from 
facts his system was nevertheless a glaring example 
of that error which bacon had called anticipation that 
illicit generalization which leaps at once from special 
tiacts to principles of the widest and remotest kind such 
for instance as the cartesian doctrine that the world is 
an absolute plenum every part being full of matter of 
some kind and that all natural effects depend on the 
laws of motion against this fault to which the human 
mind is so prone bacon had lifted his warning voice 
in vain so fer as the cartesians were concerned as indeed 
to this day one theorist after another pursues his course 
and turns a deaf ear to the verulamian injunctions per 
haps even complacently boasts that he founds his theory 
upon observation and forgets that there are as the 
aphorism of the novum organon declares two ways by 
which this may be done — the one hitherto in use and 
suggested by our common tendencies but barren and

worthless the other almost untried to be pursued only 
with effort and selfdenial but alone capable of producing 
true knowledge 

iii oassendi — thus the lessons which bacon taught 
were far from being generally accepted and applied at 
first the amount of the influence of these two men 
bacon and descartes upon their age has often been a 
subject of discussion the fortunes of the cartesian 
school have been in some measure traced in the history 
of science but i may mention the notice taken of these 
two philosophers by gassendi a contemporary and coun 
tryman of descartes qassendi as i have elsewhere 
stated was associated with descartes in public opinion 
as an opponent of the aristotelian dogmatism but was 
not in ct a follower or profound admirer of that writer 
in a treatise on logic gassendi gives an account of the 
logic of various sects and authors treating in order of 
the logic of zeno the eleatic of euclid the mega 
rean of plato of aristotle of the stoics of epicurus 
of luuius of ramus and to these he adds the logic of 
verulam and the logic of cartesius we must not he 
says on account of the celebrity it has obtained pass 
over the organon or logic of francis bacon lord veru 
lam high chancellor of england whose noble purpose 
in our time it has been to make an instauration of the 
sciences he then gives a brief account of the novum 
organon noticing the principal features in its rules and 
especially the distinction between the vulgar induction 
which leaps at once from particular experiments to the 
more general axioms and the chastised and gradual in 
duction which the author of the organon recommends 
in his account of the cartesian logic he justly observes 
that he too imitated verulam in this that being about 
to build up a new philosophy from the foundation he 

 hist indsdx lit

 review of opinions on knowledge 

wished in the first place to lay aside all prejudice and 
having then found some solid principle to make that the 
groundwork of his whole structure but he proceeds 
by a very different path from that which verulam follows 
for while verulam seeks aid from things to perfect the 
cogitation of the intellect cartesius conceives that when 
we have laid aside all knowledge of things there is in our 
thoughts alone such a resource that the intellect may by 
its own power arrive at a perfect knowledge of all even 
the most abstruse things 

the writings of descartes have been most admired 
and his method most commended by those authors who 
have employed themselves upon metaphysical rather than 
physical subjects of inquiry perhaps we might say that 
in reference to such subjects this method is not so vicious 
as at first when contrasted with the baconian induction it 
seems to be for it might be urged that the thoughts from 
which descartes begins his reasonings are in reality ea 
periments of the kind whidi the subject requires us to 
consider each such thought is a fact in the intellectual 
world and of such fects the metaphysician seeks to 
discover the laws i shall not here examine the validity of 
this plea but shall turn to the consideration of the actual 
progress of physical science and its effect on mens minds 

iv actual progress in science — the practical discover 
ers were indeed very active and very successful during the 
seventeenth century which opened with bacons survey 
and exhortations the laws of nature of which men had 
begun to obtain a glimpse in the preceding century were 
investigated with zeal and sagacity and the consequence 
was that the foundations of most of the modem physical 
sciences were laid that mode of research by experiment 
and observation which had a little time ago been a 
strange and to many an unwelcome innovation was now 
become the habitual course of philosophers the revolu

tion from the philosophy of tradition to the philosophy 
of experience was completed the great discoveries of 
kepler belonged to the preceding century they are 
not i believe noticed either by bacon or by descartes 
but they gave a strong impulse to astronomical and me 
chanical speculators by showing the necessity of a sound 
science of motion such a science galileo had already 
begun to construct at the time of which i speak his 
disciples were still labouring at this task and at other 
problems which rapidly suggested themselves they had 
already convinced themselves that air had weight in 
 torricelli proved this practically by the invention 
of the barometer in pascal proved it still further 
by sending the barometer to the top of a mountain 
pascal and boyle brought into clear view the fundamental 
laws of fluid equilibrium boyle and mariotte determined 
the law of the compression of air as regulated by its elas 
ticity otto guericke invented the air pump and by 
his magdeburg experiments on a vacuum illustrated 
still further the effects of the air guericke pursued what 
gilbert had begun the observation of electrical pheno 
mena and these two physicists made an important step 
by detecting repulsion as well as attraction in these phe 
nomena gilbert had already laid the foundations of the 
science of magnetism the law of refraction at which 
kepler had laboured in vain was as we have seen dis 
covered by snell about and published by descartes 
mersenne had discovered some of the more important 
parts of the theory of harmonics in sciences of a differ 
ent kind the same movement was visible chemical 
doctrines tended to assume a proper degree of generality

alkali and stahl soon after the phlogistic theory of com

resumed the attempt to form a systematic botany which 
had been interrupted for a hundred years from the time 
of the memorable essay of csesalpinus the grand dis 
covery of the circulation of the blood by harvey about 
 was followed in by pecquets discovery of the 
course of tlie chyle there could now no longer be any 
question whether science was progressive or whether 
observation could lead to new truths 

among these cultivators of science such sentiments as 
have been already quoted became very familiar — that 
knowledge is to be sought from nature herself by obser 
vation and experiment — that in such matters tradition 
is of no force when opposed to experience and that mere 
reasonings without facts cannot lead to solid knowledge 
but i do not know that we find in these writers any more 
special rules of induction and scientific research which 
have since been confirmed and universally adopted 
perhaps too as was natural in so great a revolution the 
writers of this time especially the secondrate ones were 
somewhat too prone to disparage the labours and talents 
of aristotle and the ancients in general and to overlook 
the ideal element of our knowledge in their zealous study 
of phenomena they urged sometimes in an exaggerated 
manner the superiority of modern times in all that regards 
science and the supreme and sole importance of facts in 
scientific investigations there prevailed among them 
also a lofty and dignified tone of speaking of the condition 
and prospects of science such as we are accustomed to 
admire in the verulamian writings for this in a less 
degree is epidemic among those who a little after his 
time speak of the new philosophy

v otto gttmickey sfc — i need not illustrate these 
characteristics at any great length i may as an example 
notice otto guerickes preface to his experimenta mag 
dedurffica he quotes a passage from kirchers 
treatise on the magnetic art in which the author says 
 hence it appears how all philosophy except it be sup 
ported by experiments is empty fallacious and useless 
what monstrosities philosophers in other respects of the 
highest and subtlest genius may produce in philosophy by 
neglecting experiment thus experience alone is the 
dissolver of doubts the reconciler of difficulties the 
sole mistress of truth who holds a torch before us in 
obscurity unties our knots teaches us the true causes of 
things guericke himself reiterates the same remark 
adding that philosophers insisting upon their own 
thoughts and arguments merely cannot come to any 
sound conclusion respecting the natural constitution of 
the world nor were the cartesians slow in taking up 
the same train of reflection thus gilbert clark who in 
 published a defence of descartes doctrine of a 
plenum in the universe speaks in a tone which reminds 
us of bacon and indeed was very probably caught from 
him natural philosophy formerly consisted entirely of 
loose and most doubtful controversies carried on in high 
iounding words fit rather to delude than to instruct men 
but at last by the favour of the deity there shone forth 
some more divine intellects who taking as their counsel 
lors reason and experience together exhibited a new 
method of philosophizing hence has been conceived a 
strong hope that philosophers may embrace not a shadow 
or empty image of truth but truth herself and that

winds will contract an alliance with mathematics yet 
this is hardly the work of one age still less of one man 
yet let not the mind despond or doubt not that one 
party of investigators after another following the same 
method of philosophizing at last under good auguries 
the mysteries of nature being daily unlocked as far as 
human feebleness will allow truth may at last appear in 
full and these nuptial torches may be lighted 

as another instance of the same kind i may quote 
the preface to the first volume of the transactions of 
the academy of sciences at paris it is only since the 
present century says the writer that we can reckon 
the revival of mathematics and physios m descartes 
and other great men have laboured at this work with so 
much success that in this department of literature the 
whole face of things has been changed men have quitted 
a sterile system of physics which for several generations 
had been always at the same point the reign of words 
and terms is passed men will have things they estab 
lish principles which they understand they follow those 
principles and thus they make progress authority has 
ceased to have more weight than reason that which 
was received without contradiction because it had been 
long received is now examined and often rejected and 
philosophers have made it their business to consult res 
pecting natural things nature herself rather than the 
ancients these had now become the commonplaces of 
those who spoke concerning the course and method of the 
sciences 

vi hoojce — in england as might be expected the

this hookes essay entitled a oeneral scheme or idea 
of the present state of natural philosophy and how its 
defects may be remedied by a methodical proceeding in 
the making experiments and collecting observations 
whereby to compile a natural history as a solid basis for 
the superstructure of true philosophy this essay may 
be looked upon as an attempt to adapt the novum or 
ganon to the age which succeeded its publication we 
have in this imitation as in the original an enumeration 
of various mistakes and impediments which had in pre 
ceding times prevented the progress of knowledge ex 
hortations to experiment and observation as the only solid 
basis of science very ingenious suggestions of trains of 
inquiry and modes of pursuing them and a promise of 
obtaining scientific truths when facts have been duly 
accumulated this last part of his scheme the author 
calls a philosophical algebra and he appears to have 
imagined that it might answer the purpose of finding 
unknown causes from known facts by means of certain 
regular processes in the same manner as common alge 
bra finds unknown from known quantities but this part 
of the plan appears to have remained unexecuted the 
suggestion of such a method was a result of the baconian 
notion that invention in a discoverer might be dispensed 
with we find hooke adopting the phrases in which this 
notion is implied thus he speaks of the understanding 
as being very prone to run into the affirmative way of 
judging and wanting patience to follow and prosecute 
the negative way of inquiry by rejection of disagreeing 
natures and he follows bacon also in the error of 
attempting at once to obtain from the cts the discovery 
of a nature instead of investigating first the measures 
and the laws of phenomena i return to more general

oldenburgs dedication of the transactions of the bojat

 i am informed by silch as weu remember the best and 
worst days of the famous lord bacon that though he 
wrote his adcancemeiu of learning and his imtamratio 
mayna in the time of his greatest power yet his greatest 
reputation rebounded first from the most intelligent 
foreigners in many parts of christendom and afler 
speaking of his practical talents and his public employ 
ments he adds much more justly still may we wonder 
how without any great skill in chemistry without much 
pretence to the mathematics or mechanics without optio 
aids or other engines of late inyention he should so much 
transcend the philosophani then liying in judicious 
and clear instructions in so many useful observations 
and discoveries i think i may say beyond the records of 
many ages and in the end of the preface to the same 
volume he speaks with great exultation of the advance 
of science all over europe referring undoubtedly to facts 
then familiar and now let envy snarl it cannot stop

again in the preface for be pursues the same 
thought into detail we must grant that in the last 
age when operative philosophy begau to recover ground 
and to tread on the heels of triumphant philology emer 
gent adventures and great successes were encountered 
by dangerous oppositions and strong obstructions gali 
iseus and others in italy suffered extremities for their 
celestial discoveries and here in england sir walter 
baleiy when he was in his greatest lustre was noto 
riously slandered to have erected a school of atheism 
because he gave countenance to chemistry to practical 
arts and to curious mechanical operations and designed 
to form the best of them into a college and queen 
elizabeths gilbert wm a long time esteemed extra 
vagant for his magnetisms and harvey for his diligent 
researches in pursuance of the circulation of the blood 
but when our renowned lord bacon had demonstrated 
the methods for a perfect restoration of all parts of real 
knowledge and the generous and philosophical peire 
skius had soon after agitated in all parts to redeem the 
most instructive antiquities and to excite experimental 
essays and fresh discoveries the success became on a 
sudden stupendous and effective philosophy began to 
sparkle and even to flow into beams of shining light all 
over the world 

the formation of the royal society of london and 
of the academy of sciences of paris from which pro 
ceeded the declamations just quoted were among many 
indications belonging to this period of the importance 
which states as well as individuals had by this time 
begun to attach to the cultivation of science the 
english society was established almost immediately 
when the restoration of the monarchy appeared to give a 
promise of tranquillity to the nation in and the 
french academy very soon afterwards in these

measures were very soon followed by the establishment 
of the observatories of paris and greenwich in 
and which may be considered to be a kind of public 
recognition of the astronomy of observation as an object 
on which it was the advantage and the duty of nations 
to bestow their wealth 

viii bacons new atalantis — when philosophers had 
their attention turned to the boundless prospect of increase 
to the knowledge and powers and pleasures of man which 
the cultivation of experimental philosophy seemed to pro 
mise it was natural that they should think of devising 
institutions and associations by which such benefits might 
be secured bacon had drawn a picture of a society 
organized with a view to such purpose in his fiction of the 
 new atalantis the imaginary teacher who explains 
this institution to the inquiring traveller describes it by 
the name oi solomons home and says the end of our 
foundation is the knowledge of causes and secret motions 
of things and the enlarging the bounds of the human 
empire to efiecting of things possible and as parts 
of this house he describes caves and wells chambers 
and towers baths and gardens parks and pools dispen 
satories and furnaces and many other contrivances pro 
vided for the purpose of making experiments of many 
kinds he describes also the various employments of the 
fellows of this college who take a share in its re 
searches there are merchants of lighty who bring books 
and inventions from foreign countries depredators who 
gather the experiments which exist in books mystery 
men who collect the experiments of the mechanical arts 
pioneers or miners who invent new experiments and 
compilers who draw the experiments of the former into 
titles and tables to give the better light for the drawing 
of observations and axioms out of them there are

also doimymen or benefactors that cast about bow to 
draw out of the experiments of their fellows things of 
use and practice for mans life lamps that direct new 
experiments of a more penetrating light than the former 
ifioculatorsf that execute the experiments so directed 
finally there are the interpreters of nature that raise the 
former discoveries by experiments into greater obser 
vations that is more general truths axioms and aphor 
isms upon this scheme we may remark that fictitious 
as it undisguisedly is it still serves to exhibit very 
clearly some of the main features of the authors philo 
sophy — namely his steady view of the necessity of 
ascending from facts to the most general truths by se 
veral stages — an exaggerated opinion of the aid that 
could be derived in such a task from technical separation 
of the phenomena and a distribution of them into 
tables — a belief probably incorrect that the offices of 
experimenter and interpreter may be entirely separated 
and pursued by different persons with a certainty of 
obtaining success — and a strong determination to make 
knowledge constantly subservient to the uses of life 

ix cowley — another project of the same kind less 
ambitious but apparently more directed to practice was 
published a little later by another eminent man 
of letters in this country i speak of cowleys propo 
sition for the advancement of experimental philosophy 
he suggests that a college should be established at a 
short distance from london endowed with a revenue 
of four thousand pounds and consisting of twenty pro 
fessors with other members the objects of the labours 
of these professors he describes to be first to examine 
all knowledge of nature delivered to us from former 
ages and to pronounce it sound or worthless second to 
recover the lost inventions of the ancients third to 
improve all arts that we now have lastly to discover

others that we yet have not in this proposal we cannot 
help marking the visible declension from bacons more 
philosophical view for we have here only a veiy vague 
indication of improving old arts and discovering new 
instead of the two clear verulamian antitheses expe 
riments and axioms deduced from them on the one 
hand and on the other an ascent to general laws and a 
derivation from these of arts for daily use moreover 
the prominent place which cowley has assigned to the 
verifying the knowledge of former ages and recovering 
 the lost inventions and drowned laws of the ancients 
implies a disposition to think too highly of traditionary 
knowledge a weakness which bacons scheme shows 
him to have fully overcome and thus it has been up 
to the present day that with all bacons mistakes in the 
philosophy of scientific method few have come up to 
him and perhaps none have gone beyond him 

cowley exerted himself to do justice to the new phi 
losophy in verse as well as prose and his poem to the 
royal society expresses in a very noble manner those 
views of the history and prospects of philosophy which 
prevailed among the men by whom the royal society 
was founded the fertility and ingenuity of comparison 
which characterise cowleys poetry are well known and 
these qualities are in this instance largely employed for 
the embellishment of his subject many of the com 
parisons which he exhibits are apt and striking philo 
sophy is a ward whose estate human knowledge is in 
his nonage kept from him by his guardians and tutors 
a case which the ancient rhetoricians were fond of 
taking as a subject of declamation and these wrong 
doers retain him in unjust tutelage and constraint for 
their own purposes until 

bacon at last a mighty man arose 

whom a wise king and nature chose 

lord chancellor of both their laws 
and boldly undertook the injured pupils cause

 bolb and extensive as had been the anticipations 
of those whose minds were excited by the promise of the 
new philosophy the discoveries of newton respecting 
the mechanics of the universe brought into view truths 
more general and profound than those earlier philoso 
phers had hoped or imagined with these vast acces 
sions to human knowledge mens thoughts were again 
set in action and philosophers made earnest and various 
attempts to draw from these extraordinary advances in 
science the tnie moral with regard to the conduct and 
limits of the human understanding they not only en 
deavoured to verify and illustrate by these new portions 
of science what had recently been taught concerning the 
methods of obstaining sound knowledge but they were 
also led to speculate concerning many new and more 
interesting questions relating to this subject they saw 
for the first time or at least far more clearly than 
before the distinction between the inquiry into the laws 
and into the causes of phenomena they were tempted 
to ask how far the discovery of causes could be carried 
and whether it would soon reach or clearly point to tlie 
ultimate cause they were driven to consider whether 
the properties which they discovered were essential pro 
perties of all matter necessarily and primarily involved 
in its essence though revealed to us at a late period by 
their derivative effects these questions even now agi 
tate the thoughts of speculative men some of them 
have already in this work been discussed or arranged

as they occurred to newtoa himself and his immediate 
followers 

 the general baconian notion of the method of 
philosophizing that it consists in ascending from pheno 
mena through various stages of generalization to truths 
of the highest order received in newtons discovery of 
the universal mutual gravitation of every particle of 
matter that pointed actual exemplification for want of 
which it had hitherto been almost overlooked or at 
least very vaguely understood that great truth and 
the steps by which it was established afford even now 
by £etr the best example of the successive ascent from 
one scientific truth to another — of the repeated tran 
sition from less to more general propositions — which w 
can yet produce as may be seen in the table which 
exhibits the relation of these steps in book xl newton 
himself did not fail to recognize this feature in the 
truths which he exhibited thus he says by the way 
of analysis we proceed from compounds to ingredients 
as from motions to the forces producing them and in 
general from effects to their causes and from particular 
causes to more general ones till the argument end in the 
most general and in like manner in another queryf 
the main business of natural philosophy is to argue 
from phenomena without feigning hypotheses and to 
deduce causes from effects till we come to the first 
cause which is certainly not mechanical 

 newton appears to have had a horror of the term 
hypothesis which probably arose from his acquaintance 
with the rash and illicit general assumptions of descartes 
thus in the passage just quoted after declaring that 
gravity must have some other cause than matter he 
says later philosophers banish the consideration of 
such a cause out of natural philosophy feigning hypo

theses for explaining all thingi mechanically and referring 
other causes to metaphysics in the celebrated scho 
lium at the end of the princtpiot he says whatever is 
not deduced from the phenomena is to be termed hypo 
thesis and hypotheses whether metaphysical or physical 
or occult causes or mechanical have no place in experi 
mental philosophy in this philosophy propositions are 
deduced from phenomena and rendered general by induc 
tion and in another place he arrests the course of his 
otm suggestions saying verum hypotheses non fingo 
i have already attempted to show that this is in reality 
a superstitious and selfdestructive spirit of speculation 
some hypotheses are necessary in order to connect the 
facts which are observed some new principle of unity 
must be applied to the phenomena before induction can 
be attempted what is requisite is that the hypothesis 
should be close to the facts and not connected with them 
by other arbitrary and untried facts and that the philoso 
pher should be ready to resign it as soon as th© facts refuse 
to confirm it we have seen in the history that it was by 
such a use of hypotheses that both newton himself and 
kepler on whose discoveries those of newton were 
based made their discoveries the suppositions of a force 
tending to the sun and varying inversely as the square of 
the distance of a mutual force between all the bodies of 
the solar system of the force of each body arising from 
the attraction of all its parts not to mention others also 
propounded by newton — were all hypotheses before they 
were verified as theories it is related that when new 
ton was asked how it was that he saw into the laws of 
nature so much further than other men he replied that 
if it were so it resulted from his keeping his thoughts 
steadily occuiied upon the subject which was to be thus 
penetrated but what is this occupation of the thoughts 
if it be not the process of keeping the phenomena clearly

in view and trying one after another all the plausible 
hypotheses which seem likel j to connect them till at last 
the true law is discorered hypotheses so used are a 
necessary element of disoovery 

 with regard to the details of the process of dis 
cotery newton has giren us some of his views which are 
well worthy of notice on account of their coming from 
him and which are real additions to the philosophy of 
this subject he speaks repeatedly of the analtsu and 
sffuheii of obsenred facts and thus marks certain steps 
in scientific research very important and not i think 
clearly pointed out by his predecessors thus he says 
as in mathematics so in naturd philosophy the 
investigation of difficult things by the method of analysis 
ought ever to precede the method of composition this 
analysis consists in making experiments and observations 
and in drawing general conclusions from them by induc 
tion and admitting of no objections against the conclu 
sions but such as are taken from experiments or other 
certain truths and although the arguing horn experi 
ments and observations by induction be no demonstration 
of general conclusions yet it is the best way of arguing 
which the nature of things admits o and may be looked 
upon as so much the stronger by how much the induction 
is more general and he then observes as we have 
quoted above that by this way of analysis we proceed 
from compounds to ingredients from motions to forces 
from effects to causes and from less to more general 
causes the anafysu here spoken of includes the steps 
which in this work we call the decomposition of facts 
the exact observation and tneasurement of the pheno 
mena and the couigatum of facts the necessary in 
termediate step the sdectien and erplicauon of the 
appropriate conception being passed over in the fear of

seeming to encourage the fabrication of hypotheses the 
synthesis of which newton here speaks consists of those 
steps of dedtictive reasoning proceeding from the con 
ception once assumed which are requisite for the compa 
rison of its consequences with the observed facts this 
statement of the process of research is as far as it goes 
perfectly exact 

 in speaking of newtons precepts on the subject 
we are naturally led to the celebrated rules of philo 
sophizing inserted in the second edition of the principia 
these rules have generally been quoted and commented 
on with an almost unquestioning reverence such rules 
coming from such an authority cannot fail to be highly 
interesting to us but at the same time we cannot here 
evade the necessity of scrutinizing their truth and value 
according to the principles which our survey of this 
subject has brought into view the rules stand at the 
beginning of that part of the principia the third book 
in which he infers the mutual gravitation of the sun 
moon planets and all parts of each they are as follows 

 rule i we are not to admit other causes of natural 
things than such as both are true and suffice for explain 
ing their phenomena 

 rules ii natural effects of the same kind are to 
be referred to the same causes as far as can be done 

 rule iii the qualities of bodies which cannot be 
increased or diminished in intensity and which belong to 
all bodies in which we can institute experiments are to 
be held for qualities of all bodies whatever 

 rule iv in experimental philosophy propositions 
collected from phenomena by induction are to be held as 
true either accurately or approximately notwithstanding 
contrary hypotheses till other phenomena occur by 
which they may be rendered either more accurate or 
liable to exception 



digitized by vjooq ic 



newton 

in considering these rules we cannot help remarking 
in the first place that they are constructed with an inten 
tional adaptation to the case with which newton has to 
deal — the induction of universal grayitation and are 
intended to protect the reasonings before which they 
stand thus the first rule is designed to strengthen the 
inference of gravitation from the celestial phenomena hy 
describing it as a vera causdy a true cause the second 
countenances the doctrine that the planetary motions are 
governed by mechanical forces as terrestrial motions are 
the third rule appears intended to justify the assertion of 
gravitation as a universal quality of bodies and the 
fourth contains along with a general declaration of the 
authority of induction the authors usual protest against 
hypotheses levelled at the cartesian hypotheses especially 

 of tlie first rule — we however must consider 
these rules in their general application in mhich point 
of view they have often been referred to and have 
had very great authority allowed them one of the 
points which has been most discussed is that maxim 
which requires that the causes of phenomena which we 
assign should be true causes tcrcb causa of course this 
does not mean that they should be the true or right 
cause for although it is the philosophers aim to discover 
such causes he would be little aided in his search of 
truth by being told that it is truth which he is to seek 
the rule has generally been understood to prescribe that 
in attempting to account for any class of phenomena we 
must assume such causes only us from other considerations 
we know to exist thus gravity which was employed in 
explaining the motions of the moon and planets was 
already known to exist and operate at the earths surface 

now the rule thus interpreted is i conceive an 
injurious limitation of the field of induction for it 
forbids us to look for a cause except among the causes 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 beview of opinions on knowledge 

with which we are already familiar but if we follow this 
rule how shall we ever become acquainted with any new 
cause or how do we know that the phenomena which 
we contemplate do really arise from some cause which 
we already truly know if they do not must we still 
insist upon making them depend upon some of our known 
causes or must we abandon the study of them altoge 
ther must we for example resolve to refer the action 
of radiant heat to the air rather than to any peculiar 
fluid or ether because the fonner is known to exist the 
latter is merely assumed for the purpose of explanation 
but why should we do this why should we not endea 
vour to learn the cause from the effects even if it be not 
already known to us we can infer causes which are 
new when we first became acquainted with them che 
mical forces optical forces vital forces are known to 
us only by chemical and optical and vital phenomena must 
we therefore reject their existence or abandon their 
study they do not conform to the double condition 
that they shall be sufficient and also real they are true 
only so far as they explain the facts but are they there 
fore unintelligible or useless are they not highly im 
portant and instructive subjects of speculation and if 
the gravitation which rules the motions of the planets 
had not existed at the earths surface — if it had been 
there masked and concealed by the superior effect of 
magnetism or some other extraneous force might not 
newton still have inferred from keplers laws the ten 
dency of the planets to the sun and from their pertur 
bations their tendency to each other his discoveries 
would still have been immense if the cause which he 
assigned had not been a vera causa in the sense now 
contemplated 

 but what do we mean by calling gravity a true 
cause how do we learn its reality of course by its

effects with which we are familiar — by the weight and 
fall of bodies about us these strike even the most 
careless observer no one can fail to see that all bodies 
which we come in contact with are heavy — that gravity 
acts in our neighbourhood here upon earth hence it 
may be said this cause is at any rate a true cause whether 
it explains the celestial phenomena or not 

but if this be what is meant by a vera causa it appears 
strange to require that in all cases we should find such a 
one to account for all classes of phenomena is it rea 
sonable or prudent to demand that we shall reduce every 
set of phenomena however minute or abstruse or com 
plicated to causes so obviously existing as to strike the 
most incurious and to be familiar among men how 
can we expect to find such vertb causa for the delicate 
and recondite phenomena which an exact and skilful 
observer detects in chemical or optical or electrical 
experiments the facts themselves are too fine for 
vulgar apprehension their relations their symmetries 
their measures require a previous discipline to understand 
them how then can their causes be found among those 
agencies with which the common unscientific herd of 
mankind are familiar what likelihood is there that 
causes held for real by such persons shall explain facts 
which such persons cannot see or cannot understand 

again if we give authority to such a rule and require 
that the causes by which science explains the facts which 
she notes and measures and analyses shall be causes 
which men without any special study have already come 
to believe in from the effects which they casually see 
around them what is this except to make our first rude 
and unscientific persuasions the criterion and test of our 
most laborious and thoughtful inferences what is it 
but to give to ignorance and thoughtlessness the right of 
pronouncing upon the convictions of intense study and

long disciplined thought electrical atmospheres 
surrounding electrized bodies were at one time held to 
be a true cause of the effects which such bodies produce 
these atmospheres it was said are obvious to the senses 
we feel them like a spiders web on the hands and iace 
sipiniis had to answer such persons by proving that there 
are no atmospheres no effluvia but only repulsion 
he thus for a true cause in the vulgar sense of the term 
substituted an hypothesis yet who doubts that what he 
did was an advance in the science of electricity 

 perhaps some persons may be disposed to say that 
newtons rule does not enjoin us to take those causes 
only which we clearly know or suppose we know to be 
really existing and operating but only causes of such kinds 
as we have already satisfied ourselves do exist in nature 
it may be urged that we are entitled to infer that the 
planets are governed in their motions by an attractive 
force because we find in the bodies immediately subject to 
observation and experiment that such motions are produced 
by attractive forces for example by that of the earth it 
may be said that we might on similar grounds infer forces 
•which unite particles of chemical compounds or deflect 
particles of light because we see adhesion and deflection 
produced by forces 

but it is easy to show that the rule thus laxly un 
derstood loses all significance it prohibits no hypothe 
sis for all hypotheses suppose causes such as in some 
case or other we have seen in action no one would think 
of explaining phenomena by referring them to forces and 
agencies altogether different from any which are known 
for on this supposition how could he pretend to reason 
about the effects of the assumed causes or undertake to 
prove that they would explain the fects some close 
similarity with some known kind of cause is requisite in 
order that the hypothesis may have the appearance of an

newton 

explanation no forces or virtues or sympathies or 
fluids or ethers would be excluded by this interpretation 
of vera causa least of all would such an interpreta 
tion reject the cartesian hypothesis of vortices which 
undoubtedly as i conceive newton intended to condemn 
by his rule for that such a case as a whirling fluid 
carrying bodies round a centre in orbits does occur is too 
obvious to require proof every eddying stream or blast 
that twirls the dust in the road exhibits examples of such 
action and would justify the assumption of the vortices 
which carry the planets in their courses as indeed with 
out doubt such fects suggested the cartesian explanation 
of the solar system the vortices in this mode of con 
sidering the subject are at the least as real a cause of 
motion as gravity itself 

 thus the rule which enjoins true causes is nuga 
tory if we take vera causes in the extended sense of any 
causes of a real mnd and unphilosophical if we under 
stand the term of those very causes which we femiliarly 
suppose to exist but it may be said that we are to 
designate as true causes not those which are collected 
in a loose confused and precarious manner by undisci 
plined minds from obvious phenomena but those which 
are justly and rigorously inferred such a cause it may 
be added gravity is for the facts of the downward 
pressures and downward motions of bodies at the earths 
surface lead us by the plainest and strictest induction to 
the assertion of such a force now to this interpretation 
of the rule there is no olyection but then it must be 
observed that on this view terrestrial gravity is inferred 
by the same process as celestial gravitation and the 
cause is no more entitled to be called true because it is 
obtained from the former than because it is obtained from 
the latter class of facts we thus obtain an intelligible 
and tenable explanation of a vera causa but then by this

explanation its ferity ceases to be distinguishable from 
its other condition that it suffices for the explanation of 
the phenomena the assumption of imiversal gravitation 
accounts for the fall of a stone it also accounts for the 
rerolutions of the moon or of saturn but since both these 
explanations are of the same kind we cannot with justice 
make the one a criterion or condition of the admissibility 
of the other 

 but still the rule so understood is so fiar from 
being unmeaning or frivolous that it expresses one of the 
most important tests which can be given of a sound 
physical theory it is true the explanation of one set of 
facts may be of the same nature as the explanation of the 
other class but then that the cause explains both classes 
gives it a very different claim upon our attention and 
assent from that which it would have if it explained one 
class only the very circumstance that the two explana 
tions coincide is a most weighty presumption in their 
favour it is the testimony of two witnesses in behalf of 
the hypothesis and in proportion as these two vdtnesses 
are separate and independent the conviction produced by 
their agreement is more and more complete when the 
explanation of two kinds of phenomena distinct and not 
apparently connected leads us to the same cause such a 
coincidence does give a reality to the cause which it has 
not while it merely accounts for those appearances which 
suggested the supposition this coincidence of propo 
sitions inferred from separate classes of facts is exactly 
what we noticed in the last book as one of the most 
decisive characteristics of a true theory under the name 
of the consilience of inductions 

that newtons first rule of philosophizing so under 
stood authorizes the inferences which he himself made is 
really the ground on which they are so firmly believed 
by philosophers thus when the doctriae of a gravity

tarying inversely as the square of the distance irom the 
body accounted at the same time for the relations of 
times and distances in the planetary orbits and for the 
amount of the moons deflection from the tangent of her 
orbit such a doctrine became most convincing or again 
when the doctrine of the universal gravitation of all parts 
of matter which explained so admirably the inequalities 
of the moons motions also gave a satisfactory account of 
a phenomenon utterly different the precession of the 
equinoxes and of the same kind is the evidence in 
favour of the undulatory theory of light when the as 
sumption of the length of an undulation to which we are 
led by the colours of thin plates is found to be identical 
with that length which explains the phenomena of difac 
tion or when the hypothesis of transverse vibrations 
suggested by the facts of polarization explains also the 
laws of double refraction when such a convergence of two 
trains of induction points to the same spot we can no 
longer suspect that we are wrong such an accumula 
tion of proof really persuades us that we have to do with 
a vera causa and if this kind of proof be multiplied — if 
we again find other facts of a sort uncontemplated in 
framing our hypothesis but yet clearly accounted for when 
we have adopted the supposition — we are still further 
confirmed in our belief and by such accumulation of 
proof we may be so far satisfied as to believe without 
conceiving it possible to doubt in this case when the 
validity of the opinion adopted by us has been repeatedly 
confirmed by its sufficiency in unforeseen cases so that 
all doubt is removed and forgotten the theoretical cause 
takes its place among the realities of the world and 
becomes a true came

natural phenomena but that when two different classes 
of facts lead us to the same hypothesis we may hold it 
to be a true causej and this rule will rarely or never 
mislead us there are no instances in which a doctrine 
recommended in this manner has afterwards been discov 
ered to be false there have been hypotheses which have 
explained many phenomena and kept their ground long 
and have afterwards been rejected but these have been 
hypotheses which explained only one class of phenomena 
and their fall took place when another kind of facts 
was examined and brought into conflict with the former 
thus the system of eccentrics and epicycles accounted for 
all the observed motions of the planets and was the means 
of expressing and transmitting all astronomical knowledge 
for two thousand years but then how was it overthrown 
by considering the distances as well as motions of the 
heavenly bodies here was a second class of facts and 
when the system was adjusted so as to agree with the one 
class it was at variance with the other these cycles and 
epicycles could not be true because they could not be 
made a just representation of the facts but if the mea 
sures of distance as well as of position had conspired in 
pointing out the cycles and epicycles as the paths of the 
planets the paths so determined could not have been 
 otherwise than their real paths and the epicyclical theory 
would have been at least geometrically true 

 of the second ride — newtons second rule di 
rects that natural events of the same kind are to be 
referred to the same causes so far as can be done isuch a 
precept at first appears to help us but little for all sys 
tems however little solid profess to conform to such a 
rule when any theorist undertakes to explain a class 
of facts he assigns causes which according to him will by 
their natural action as seen in other cases produce the 
effects in question the events which he accounts for by

bis hypothetical cause are he holds of the same kind as 
those which such a cause is known to produce kepler 
in ascribing the planetary motions to magnetism descar 
tes in explaining them by means of vortices held that 
they were referring celestial motions to the causes which 
give rise to terrestrial motions of the same kind the 
question is are the effects of the same kind this once 
settled there will be no question about the propriety of 
assigning them to the same cause but the difficulty is 
to determine when events are of the same kind are the 
motions of the planets of the same kind with the motion 
of a body moving freely in a curvilinear path or do they 
not rather resemble the motion of a floating body swept 
round by a whirling current the newtonian and the 
cartesian answered this question differently how then 
can we apply this rule with any advantage 

 to this we reply that there is no way of escaping 
this uncertainty and ambiguity but by obtaining a clear 
possession of the ideas which our hypothesis involves and 
by reasoning rigorously from them newton asserts that 
the planets move in free paths acted on by certain forces 
the most exact calculation gives the closest agreement 
of the results of this hypothesis with the facts descartes 
asserts that the planets are carried round by a fluid the 
more rigorously the conceptions of force and the laws of 
motion are applied to this hypothesis the more signal is 
its failure in reconciling the facts to one another with 
out such calculation we can come to no decision between 
the two hypotheses if the newtonian hold that the 
motions of the planets are emdendy of the same kind as 
those of a body describing a curve in free space and 
therefore like that to be explained by a force acting 
upon the body the cartesian denies that the planets do 
move in free space they are he maintains immersed 
in a plenum it is only when it appears that comets

pass through this plenum in all directions with no impe 
diment and that no possible form and motion of its 
whirlpools can explain the forces and motions which are 
observed in the solar system that he is compelled tq 
allow the newtonians classificatioa of events of the same 
kind 

thus it does not appear that this rule of newton 
ean be interpreted in any distinct and positive manner 
otherwise than as enjoining that in the task of induction 
we employ clear ideas rigorous reasoning and close and 
feir comparison of the results of the hypothesis with the 
facts these are no doubt important an fundamental 
conditions of a just induction but in this iijunption we 
find no peculiar or technicil criterion by which we may 
satisfy ourselves that we are rights or detect our errors 
still of such general prudential rules none can be 
more wise than one which thus in the task of connecting 
facts by means of ideas recommends that the ideas bo 
clear the facts correct and the chain of reasoning whicl 
connects them without a flaw 

 the third bule— the third rule that qua 
lities which are observed without exception be hd to 
be universal as i have already said seems to be 
intended to authorize the assertion of gravitation as a 
universal attribute of matter we formerly stated in 
treating of mechanical ideas that this application of 
such a rule appears to be a mode of reasoning far from 
conclusive the assertion of the universality of any pro 
perty of bodies must be grounded upon the reason of the 
ease and not upon any arbitrary maxim is it intended 
by this rule to prohibit any further examination how t 
gravity is an original property of matter and how r it 
may be resolved into the result of other inoies we 
know pecfeotly well that this was not newtons intontioq

since the cause of gmvitj was a point which he proposed 
to himself as subject of inquiry it would certainly be 
very unphilosophioal to pretend by this rule of philo 
sophizing to prejudge the question of such hypotheses as 
that of mosotti that gravity is the excess of the elee 
trical attraction over electrical repulsion and yet to 
adopt this hypothesis would be to suppose electrical 
forces more truly universal than gravity for according 
to the hypothesis gravity being the inequality of the 
attraction and repulsion is only an accidental and partial 
relation of these forces nor would it be allowable to 
urge this rule as a reason of assuming that double stars 
are attracted to each other by a force varying according 
to the inverse square of the distance without examining 
as herschel and others have done the orbits which they 
really describe but if the rule is not available in such 
cases what is its real value and authority and in tirhat 
eases are they exemplified 

 in a former part of this work it was shown that 
the fundamental laws of motion and the properties of 
matter which these involve are after a full consideration 
of the sulgeet unavoidably assumed as univmsally true 
it was further shown that although our knowledge of 
these laws and properties be gathered from experience 
we are strongly impelled some philosophers tidnk autho 
rimd to look upon these as not only universally but 
oeoessarily true it was also stated that the lw of gra 
vitation though its universality may be deemed pvobable 
does not apparently involve the same necessity as the 
fundamental lawa of motion but it was pointed out 
that these are some of the most abstruse and difficult 
questions of the whole of philosophy involving the pror 
found perhaps insoluble problem of the identity or diveiw 
sity of ideas and thingt it cannot therefore be deobiod

philosophical to cut these gordiaa knots by peremptory 
maximsy which encourage us to decide without rendering 
a reason moreover it appears clear that the reason 
which is rendered for this rule by the newtonians is 
quite untenable namely that w know extension hard 
ness and inertia to be universal qualities of bodies by 
experience alone and that we have the same evidence of 
experience for the universality of gravitation we have 
already observed that we cannot with any propriety say 
that we find by experience all bodies are extended this 
could not be a just assertion except we could conceive 
the possibility of our finding the contrary but who can 
conceive our finding by experience some bodies which 
are not extended it appears then that the reason 
given for the third rule of newton involves a mistake 
respecting the nature and authority of experience and 
the rule itself cannot be applied without attempting to 
decide by the casual limits o observation questions which 
necessarily depend upon the relations of ideas 

 of the fourth zttfe— newtons fourth rule is 
that propositions collected from phenomena by induc 
tion shall be held to be true notwithstanding contrary 
hypotheses but shall be liable to be rendered more accu 
rate or to have their exceptions pointed out by addi 
tional study of phenomena this rule contains little 
more than a general assertion of the authority of induc 
tion accompanied by newtons usual protest against 
hypotheses 

the really valuable part of the fourth rule is that 
which implies that a constant verification and if neces 
sary rectification of truths discovered by induction should 
go on in the scientific world even when the law is or 
appears to be most certainly exact and universal it should 
be constantly exhibited to us afresh in the form of expe 
rience and observation this is necessary in order to

newton s 

discover exceptions and modifications if such exist and 
if the law be rigorously true the contemplation of it as 
exemplified in the world of phenomena will best give us 
that clear apprehension of its bearings which may lead us 
to see the ground of its truth 

the concluding clause of this fourth rule appears at 
first to imply that all inductive propositions are to be 
considered as merely provisional and limited and never 
secure from exception but to judge thus would be to 
underrate the stability and generality of scientific truths 
for what man of science can suppose that we shall here 
after discover exceptions to the universal gravitation of 
all parts of the solar system and it is plain that the 
author did not intend the restriction to be applied so 
rigorously for in the third rule as we have just seen 
he authorizes us to infer universal properties of matter 
from observation and carries the liberty of inductive 
inference to its full extent the third rule appears to 
encourage us to assert a law to be universal even in cases 
in which it has not been tried the fourth rule seems 
to warn us that the law may be inaccurate even in cases 
in which it has been tried nor is either of these sug 
gestions erroneous but both the universality and the 
rigorous accuracy of our laws are proved by reference to 
ideas rather than to experience a truth which perhaps 
the philosophers of newtons time were somewhat dis 
posed to overlook 

 the disposition to ascribe all our knowledge to 
experience appears in newton and the newtonians by 
other indications for instance it is seen in their extreme 
dislike to the ancient expressions by which the principles 
and causes of phenomena were described as the occidt 
causes of the schoolmen and iie forms of the aristotelians 
which had been adopted by bacon newton says that 

 optk qu

the particles of matter not only possess inertia but also ac 
tive principles as gravity fermentation cohesion he adds 
 these principles i consider not as occult qualities sup 
posed to result from the specific forms of things but as 
general laws of nature by which the things themselves 
are formed their truth appearing to us by phenomena 
though their causes be not yet discovered for these 
are manifest qualities and their causes only are occult 
and the aristotelians gave the name of occidt qnditiesy 
not to manifest qualities but to such qualities only as 
they supposed to lie hid in bodies and to the unknown 
causes of manifest efiects such as would be the causes 
of gravity and of magnetick and electrick attractions 
and of fermentations if we should suppose that these 
forces or actions arose from qualities unknown to us and 
incapable of being discovered and made manifest such 
occult qualities put a stop to the improvement of natural 
philosophy and therefore of late years have been rejected 
to tell us that every species of things is endowed with 
an occult specific quality by which it acts and produces 
manifest effects is to tell us nothing but to derive two 
or three general principles of motion from phenomena 
and afterwards to tell us how the properties and actions 
of all corporeal things follow from these manifest prin 
ciples would be a great step in philosophy though the 
causes of those principles were not yet discovered and 
therefore i scruple not to propose the principles of motion 
above maintained they being of very general extent and 
leave their causes to be found out 

 all that is here said is highly philosophical and 
valuable but we may observe that the investigation of 
specific formsy in the sense in which some writers had 
used the phrase was no means a frivolous or unmeaning 
object of inquiry bacon and others had used form as

equivalent to law if vre could ascertain that arrange 
ment of the particles of a crystal from which its external 
crystalline form and other properties arise this arrange 
ment would be the internal form of the crystal if the 
undulatory theory be true the form of light is transverse 
vibrations if the emission theory be maintained the form 
of light is particles moving in straight lines and deflected 
by various forces both the terms form and law imply 
an ideal connexion of sensible phenomena form supposes 
matter which is moulded to the form law supposes 
objects which are governed by the law the former 
term refers more precisely to existences the latter to 
occurrences the latter term is now the more familiar 
and is perhaps the better metaphor but the former also 
contains the essential antithesis which belongs to the 
subject and might be used in expressing the same con 
clusions 

but occult causes employed in the way in which 
newton describes had certainly been very prejudicial to 
the progress of knowledge by stopping inquiry with a 
mere word the absurdity of such pretended explaua 
tions had not escaped ridicule the pretended physician 
in the comedy gives an example of an occult cause or 
virtue

 but the most valuable part of the view presented 
to us in the quotation just given from newton is the 
distinct separation already noticed as peculiarly brought 
into prominence by him of the determination of the 
laws of phenomena and the investigation of their causes 
the maxim that the former inquiry must precede the 
latter and that if the general laws of facts be discovered 
the result is highly valuable although the causes remain 
unknown is extremely important and had not i think 
ever been so strongly and clearly stated till newton both 
repeatedly promulgated the precept and added to it the 
weight of the most striking examples 

we have seen that newton along with views the 
most just and important concerning the nature and 
methods of science had something of the tendency pre 
valent in his time to suspect or reject at least specula 
tively all elements of knowledge except observation 
this tendency was however in him so corrected and 
restrained by his own wonderful sagacity and mathema 
tical habits that it scarcely led to any opinion which we 
might not safely adopt but we must now consider the 
cases in which this tendency operated in a more unba 
lanced manner and led to the assertion of doctrines 
which if consistently followed would destroy the very 
foundations of all general and certain knowledge

 in the constant opposition and struggle of the 
schools of philosophy which consider our senses and our 
ideas respectively as the principal sources of our know 
ledge we have seen that at the period of which we now 
treat the tendency was to exalt the external and dis 
parage the internal element the disposition to ascribe 
our knowledge to observation alone had already in 
bacons time led him to dwell to a disproportionate 
degree upon that half of his subject and had tinged 
newtons expressions though it had not biassed his pracr 
tice but this partiality soon assumed a more prominent 
shape becoming extreme in locke and extravagant in 
those who professed to follow him 

indeed locke appears to owe his popularity and 
influence as a popular writer mainly to his being one of 
the first to express in a plain and unhesitating manner 
opinions which had for some time been ripening in the 
minds of a large portion of the cultivated public hobbes 
had already promulgated the main doctrines which 
locke afterwards urged on the subject of the origin and 
nature of our knowledge but in him these doctrine 
were combined with offensive opinions on points of 
morals government and religion so that their access to 
general favour was impeded and it was to locke that 
they were indebted for the extensive influence which they 
soon after obtained locke owed this authority mainly 
to the intellectual circumstances of the time although 
a writer of great merit he by no means possesses such 
metaphysical acuteness or such philosophical largeness of 
view or such a charm of writing as to give him the high 
place he has held in the literature of europe but he

came at a period when the reign of ideas was tottering 
to its fall all tlie most actiye and ambitious spirits had 
gone over to the new opinions and were prepared to 
follow the fortunes of the philosophy of experiment 
then in the most prosperous and brilliant condition and 
full of still brighter promise there wore indeed a few 
learned and thoughtful men who still remained faithful 
to the empire of ideas partly it may be from a too 
fond attachment to ancient systems but partly also 
because they knew that there were subjects of vast im 
portance in which experience did not form the whole 
foundation of our knowledge they knew too that 
many of the plausible tenets of the new philosophy were 
revivals of fallacies which had been discussed and refuted 
in ancient times but the advocates of mere experience 
came on with a vast store of weighty truth among their 
artillery and with the energy which the advance usually 
bestows the ideal system of philosophy could for the 
present make no effectual resistance locke by putting 
himself at the head of the assault became the hero of his 
day and his name has been used as the watchword of 
those who adhere to the philosophy of the senses up to 
our own times 

 locke himself did not assert the exclusive autho 
rity of the senses in the extreme unmitigated manner in 
which some who call themselves his disciples have done 
but this is the common lot of the leaders of revolutions 
for they are usually bound by some ties of affection and 
habit to the previous state of things and would not 
destroy all traces of that condition while their followers 
attend not to their inconsistent wishes but to the mean 
ing of the revolution itself and carry out to their genu 
ine and complete results the principles which won the 
victory and which have been brought out more sharp 
from the conflict thus locke himself does not assert

that all our ideas are derired from sensation but from 
sensation and reflection but it was easily seen that in 
this assertion two very heterogeneous elements werd 
conjoined that while to pronounce sensation thib origin 
of ideas is a clear decided tenet the acceptance or rejec 
tion of which determines the general character of our 
philosophy to make the same declaration concerning 
reflection is in the highest degree vague and ambiguous 
since reflection may either be lesolved into a mere modi 
fication of sensation as was done by one school or may 
mean all that the opposite school oppose to sensation 
under the name of ideas hence the clear and strong 
impression which fastened upon mens minds and which 
does in fact represent all the systematic and consistent 
part of lockes philosophy was that in it all our ideas 
are represented as derived from sensation 

 we need not spend much time in pointing out 
the inconsistencies into which locke fell as all must 
fall into inconsistences who recognize no source of know 
ledge except the senses thus ho maintains that our 
idea of space is derived from the senses of sight and 
touch our idea of solidity from the touch alone our 
notion of substance is an unknown support of unknown 
qualities and is illustrated by the indian fable of the 
tortoise which supports the elephant which supports the 
world our notion of power or cause is in like manner 
got from the senses and yet though these ideas are 
thus mere fragments of our experience locke does not 
hesitate to ascribe to them necessity and universality 
when they occur in propositions thus he maintains the 
necessary truth of geometrical properties he asserts that 
the resistance arising from solidity is absolutely insuf 
mountable he conceives that nothing short of omni 
potence can annihilate a particle of matter f and he has

ho misgivings in arguing upon the axiom that every thing 
must have a cause he does not perceive that upon his 
own account of the origin of our knowledge we can have 
no right to make any of these assertions if our know 
ledge of the truths which concern the external world 
were wholly derived from experience all that we could 
venture to say would be — that geometrical properties of 
figures are true as far as we have tiied them — that we 
have seen no example of a solid body being reduced to 
occupy less space by pressure or of a material substance 
nnihilated by natural means — and that wherecer we 
have examined we have found that every change has had 
a cause experience can never entitle us to declare that 
what she has not seen is impossible still less that things 
which she can not see are certain locke himself 
intended to throw no doubt upon the certainty of either 
human or divine knowledge but his principles when 
men discarded the temper in which he applied them 
and the checks to their misapplication which he con 
ceived that he had provided easily led to a very com 
prehensive scepticism his doctrines tended to dislodge 
from their true bases the most indisputable parts of 
knowledge as for example pure and mixed mathe 
matics it may well be supposed therefore that they 
shook the foundations of many other parts of knowledge 
in the minds of common thinkers 

it was not long before these consequences of the over 
throw of ideas showed themselves in the speculative 
world i have already in a previous part of this work 
mentioned humes sceptical inferences from lockes 
maxim that we have no ideas except those which we 
acquire by experience and the doctrines set up in oppo

they were so much more clearly and decidedly followed 
out in france that i shall pursue their history in that 
country 

 the french followers of lockey condiuacy sfc 
most of the french writers who adopted lockes leading 
doctrines rejected the reflection which formed an 
anomalous part of his philosophy and declared that sen 
sation alone was the source of ideas among these 
writers condillac was tlie most distinguished he ex 
pressed the leading tenet of their school in a clear and 
pointed manner by saying that all ideas are tranformed 
sensations we have already considered this point 
and need not here longer dwell upon it 

opinions such as these tend to annihilate as we have 
seen one of the two coordinate elements of our know 
ledge yet they were r from being so prejudicial to 
the progress of science or even of the philosophy of 
science as might have been anticipated one reason of 
this was that they were practically corrected especially 
among the cultivators of natural philosophy by the study 
of mathematics for that study did really supply all that 
was requisite on the ideal side of science so far as the 
ideas of space time and number were concerned and 
partly also with regard to the idea of cause and others 
and the methods of discovery though the philosophy of 
them made no material advance were practically employed 
with so much activity and in so many various subjects 
that a certain kind of prudence and skill in this employ 
ment was very widely diffused 

 importance of language — in one respect this 
school of metaphysicians rendered a very valuable service

in the fonpation and progvess of knowledge and pointed 
out that the oflsce of language is not only to oonyey and 
preserve our thoughts but to perfonn the analyms in 
which reasoning consists they were led to this train of 
spepulatioui in fk great measure by taking pure mathe 
matical science as their standard example of substantial 
knowledge condillae rejecting as we hav said almost 
all those ideas on which universal and demonstrable 
truths must be based was still not at all disposed to 
question the reality of human knowledge but was on 
the contrary a aealous admirer of the evidence and con 
nexion which appear in those sciences which have the 
ideas of space and number for their foundation especially 
the latter he looked for the grounds of the certainty 
and reality of the knowledge which these science con 
tain and found them as he conceived in the nature of 
the language which they employ the signs which are 
used in arithmetic and algebra enable us to keep steadily 
in view the identity of the same quantity under all the 
forms which by composition and decomposition it may 
be made to assume and these signs also not only express 
the operations which are performed but suggest the ex 
tension of the operations according to analogy algebra 
according to him is only a very perfect language and 
language answers its purpose of leading us to truth by 
possessing the characteristics of algebra words are the 
symbols of certain groups of impressions or facts they 
are so selected and applied as to exhibit the analogies 
which prevail among these facts and these analogies are 
the truths of which our knowledge consists every 
language is an analytical method every analytical method 
is a language these were the truths alike new and 
simple as be held which he conceived that he had 
demonstrated the art of speaking the art of writings

the art of reasoning the art of thinking are only at 
bottom one and the same art each of these opera 
tions consists in a succession of analytical operations 
and words are the marks by which we are able to fix our 
minds upon the steps of this analysis 

 the analysis of our impressions and notions does 
in reality lead to truth not only in virtue of the identity 
of the whole with its parts as condillac held but also in 
virtue of certain ideas which govern the synthesis of our 
sensations and which contain the elements of universal 
truths as we have all along endeavoured to show but 
although condillao overlooked or rejected this doctrine 
the importance of words as marking the successive steps 
of this synthesis and analysis is not less than he repre 
sented it to be every truth once established by induc 
tion from facts when it is become familiar under a brief 
and precise form of expression becomes itself a fact and 
is capable of being employed along with other facts of a 
like kind as the materials of fresh inductions in this 
successive process the term like the cord of a fagot 
both binds together the facts which it includes and makes 
it possible to manage the assemblage as a single things 
on occasion of most discoveries in science the selection 
of a technical term is an essential part of the proceeding 
in the history of science we have had numerous oppor 
tunities of remarking this and the list of technical 
terms given as an index to that work refers us by almost 
every word to one such occasion and these terms 
which thus have had so large a share in the formation of 
science and which constitute its language do also offer 
the means of analysing its truths each into its con 
stituent truths and these into facts more special till 
the original foundations of our most generd proposi 
tions are clearly exhibited the relations of general

and particular truths are most evidently represented by 
the inductive tables given in book xi but each step 
in each of these tables has its proper form of expression 
familiar among the cultivators of science and the ana 
lysis which our tables display is commonly performed in 
mens minds when it becomes necessary by fixing the 
attention successively upon a series of words not upon 
the lines of a table language offers to the mind such 
a scale or ladder as the table offers to the eye and as 
such tables present to us as we have said the logic of 
induction that is the formal conditions of the soundness 
of our reasoning from fitcts we may with propriety say 
that a just analysis of the meaning of words is an essen 
tial portion of inductive logic 

in saying this we must not forget that a decompo 
sition of general truths into ideas as well as into facts 
belongs to our philosophy but the point we have here 
to remark is the essential importance of words to the 
latter of these processes and this point had not ever 
had its due weight assigned to it till the time of condil 
lac and other followers of locke who pursued their 
speculations in the spirit i have just described the 
doctrine of the importance of terms is the most consider 
able addition to the philosophy of science which has been 
made since the time of bacon

locke and his french followers 

this work belong for the most part to the school of locke 
and condillac and we may make a few remarks upon 
them in order to bring into view one or two points in 
addition to what we have already said of that school 
the discours preliminaire written by dalembert is cele 
brated as containing a view of the origin of our knowledge 
and the connexion and classification of the sciences 

a tendency of the speculations of the encyclopedists 
as of the school of locke in general is to reject all ideal 
principles of coniiexion among facts as something which 
experience the only source of true knowledge does not 
give hence all certain knowledge consists only in the 
recognition of the same thing under different aspects or 
different forms of expression axioms are not the result 
of an original relation of ideas but of the use or it may 
be the abuse of words in like manner the propo 
sitions of geometry are a series of modifications — of dis 
tortions so to speak — of one original truth much as if 
the proposition were stated in the successive forms of 
expression presented by a language which was constantly 
growing more and more artificial several of the sciences 
which rest upon physical principles that is says the 
writer truths of experience or simple hypotheses have 
only an experimental or hypothetical certainty impe 
netrability added to the idea of extent is a mystery in 
addition the nature of motion is a riddle for philosophers 
the metaphysical principle of the laws of percussion is 
equally concealed from them the more profoundly they 
study the idea of matter and of the properties which re 
present it the more obscure this idea becomes the more 
completely does it escape them 

 this is a very common style of reflection even 
down to our own times i have endeavoured to show that

ignorance of the real nature of things proceeds from the 
rejection of ideas and tke assumption of the senses aloue 
as the ground of knowledge • observation ttnd calcu

of the school of which we now speftk and its import 
amounts to this — that they reject all ideas except the idea 
of number and recognize the modifications which part 
undergo by addition and subtraction m the only modes 
in which true propositions are generated the laws of

 anothei characteristic indication of the temper of 
the encyclopedists and of the age to which they belong 
is the importanee by them assigned to those prsctical arts 
which minister to mans comfort and convenience not 
only in the body of the encyclopedia are the mechanical 
arts placed side by side with the sciences and treated at 
great length but in the preliminary discourse the prefe 
rence assigned to the liberal over the mechanical arts is 
treated as a prejudice and the value of science is spoken 
of as measured by its utility the discovery of the ma 
riners compass is not less advantageous to the human 
race than the explanation of its properties would be to 
physhjs— why should we not esteem those to whom we 
owe the fusee and the escapement of watches as much as 
the inventors of algebra and in the classification of 
sciences which accompanies the discourse the labours of 
artisans of all kinds have a place 

this cksslllcation of the various branches of science 
contained in the dissertation is often spoken of it 
has ibr its basis the classification proposed by bacon 
in which the parts of human knowledge are arranged 
according to the faculties of the mind in which they 
originate and these fticulties are taken both by bacon 
and by dalembert as memory reason and imagi 
nation the insufficiency of bacons arrangement as a 
scientific classification is so glaring that the adoption of 
it with only superficial modifications at the period of the 
encyclopedia is a remarkable proof of the want of origi 
nal thought and real philosophy at the time of which we 
speak 

 we need not trace further the opinion which de 
rives all our knowledge from the senses in its application

to the philosophy of science its decliured aim is to 
reduce all knowledge to the knowledge of facts and it 
rejects all inquiries which iuyolve the idea of cause and 
similar ideas describing them as metaphysical or in 
some other damnatory way it professes indeed to dis 
card all ideas but as we have long ago seen some ideals 
or other are inevitably included even in the simplest 
facts accordingly the speculations of this school aie 
compelled to retain tlie relations of position succession 
number and resemblance which are rigmuly ideal 
relations the philosophy of sensation in order to be 
consistent ought to reject these ideas along with the 
rest and to deny altogether the possibility of general 
knowledge 

when the opinions of the sensational school had gone 
to an extreme length a reaction naturally began to take 
place in mens minds such have been the alternations 
of opinion from the earliest ages of human speculation 
man may perhaps have existed in an original condition in 
which he was only aware of the impressions of sense 
but his first attempts to analyse his perceptions brought 
under his notice ideas as a separate element essitial to 
the existence of knowledge ideas were thenceforth 
almost the sole subject of the study of philosophers of 
plato and his disciples professedly of aristotle and still 
more of the followers and commentators of aristotle 
ractically and this continued till the time of grahleo 
when the authority of the senses again began to be 
asserted for it was shown by the great discoveries which 
were then made that the senses had at least some shiue 
in the promotion of knowledge as discoveries more 
numerous and more striking were supplied by observation 
the world gradually passed over to the opinion that the 
share which had been ascribed to ideas in the formation of 
real knowledge was altogether a delusion and that sen

sation alone was true but when this was asserted as a 
general doctrine both its manifest falsity and its alarming 
consequences roused mens minds and made them recoil 
from the extreme point to which they were approaching 
philosophy again oscillated back towards ideas and over 
a great part of europe in the clearest and most compre 
hensive minds this regressicm from the dogmas of the 
sensational school is at present the prevailing movement 
we shall conclude our review by noticing a few indica 
tions of this state of tiiiings 



chapter xv 

the reaction against the sensational 
school 

 when lockes essay appeaied it was easily seen 
that its tendency was to urge in a much more rigorous 
sense than had previously been usual the ancient maxim 
of aristotle adopted by the schoolmen of the middle ages 
that nothing exists in the intellect but what has entered 
by the senses leibnitz expressed in a pointed manner 
the limitation iith which this doctrine had always been 
understood nihil est in intellectu quod non prius 
fuerit in sensu — wdww he added wt intellectus ipse 
to this it has been objected that we cannot say that 
the intellect is in the intellect but this remark is 
obviously frivolous for the faculties of the understanding 
which are what the argument against the sensational 
school requires us to reserve may be said to be in the 
understanding with aa much justice as we may assert 
there are in it the impressions derived from sense and 
when we take account of these faculties aad of the ideas

to wbiohi by tbir operation we necessarily subordinate 
our apprehension of phenomena we are led to a refuta 
tion of the philosophy which makes phenomena uneon 
dooted by ideas the source of all knowledge the 
succeeding opponents of the lockian school insisted upon 
and developed in various ways this remftrk of leibnitz 
or some equivalent view 

 it was by inquiries into the foundations of morals 
that english philosophers were led to question the truth 
of lockes theory dr price in his review of the prin 
cipal questions in morals first published in main 
tained that we cannot with propriety assert all our ideas 
to be derived from sensation and reflection he pointed 
out very steadily the other source the power i 
assert that understands or the faculty within us that dis 
cerns trut and that compares all the objects of thought 
and judges of them is a spring of new ideas and he 
exhibits the antithesis in various forms were not 
sense and knowledge entirely different we should iest 
satisfied with sensible impressions such as light colours 
and sounds and inquire no further about them at least 
when the impressions are strong and vigorous whereas on 
the contrary we necessarily desire some further acquaint 
ance with them and can never be satisfied till we have 
subjected them to the survey of reason sense presents 
particular forms to the mind but cannot rise to nxij general 
ideas it is the intellect that examines and compares the 
presited forms that rises above individuals to universal 
fuid abstract ideas and thus looks downward upon 
objects takes in at one view an infinity of particukrs 
and is capable of discovering general truths sense sees 
only the outside of things reason acquaints itself with 
their natures sensation is only a mode of feeling in the 
ind but knowledge implies an active and vital energy

is a source of new ideas is not so exceptionable a mode 
of speaking as has been sometimes supposed according 
to locke seme furnishes our ideas and reason perceives 
their agreements and disagreements but the truth is 
that these agreements and disagreements are in many 
instances simple ideas of which no analysis can be given 
and of which the origin must therefore be referred to 
reason according to lockes own doctrine this view 
according to which the reason or understanding is the 
source of certain simple ideas such as identity causation 
equality which ideas are necessarily involved in the 
intuitive judgments which we form when we recognize 
fundamental truths of science approaches very near in 
effect to the doctrine which in this work we have pre 
sented of fundamental ideas belonging to each science 
and manifesting themselves in the axioms of the science 
it may be observed however that by attempting to enu 
merate these ideas and axioms so as to lay the founda 
tions of the whole body of physical science and by 
endeavouring as far as possible to simplify and connect 
each group of such ideas we have at least given a more 
systematic form to this doctrine we have moreover 
traced it into many consequences to which it necessarily 
leads but which do not appear to have been contemplated 
by the metaphysicians of the scotch school but i 
gladly acknowledge jny obligations to the writere of that 
school and i trust that in the near agreement of my 
views on such points with theirs there is ground for 
believing the system of philosophy which i have in this 
work presented to be that to which the minds of thought 
ful men who have meditated on such subjects are gene 
rally tending 

 as a further instance that such a tendency is at 
work i may make a quotation from an eminent english 
philosophical writer of another school if you will be

reaction against the sensational school 

kt the pains says archbishop whately carefully to 
analyse the simplest description you hear of any transac 
tion or state of things you mill find that the process 
which almost invariably takes place is in logical lan 
guage this that each individual has in his mind certain 
major premises or principles relative to the subject in 
question — that observation of what actually presents 
itself to the senses supplies minor premises and that the 
statement given and which is reported as a thing experi 
enced consists in fact of the condtisions drawn from the 
combinations of these premises the major premises 
here spoken of are the fundamental ideas and the axioms 
and propositions to which they lead and whatever is 
regarded as a feet of observation is necessarily a conclu 
sion in which these propositions are assumed for these 
contain as we have said the conditions of our experience 
our experience conforms to these axioms and their conse 
quences whether or not the connexion be stated in a 
logical manner by means of premises and a conclusion 

 the same persuasion is also suggested by the 
course which the study of metaphysics has taken of late 
years in france tn that country as we have seen the 
sensational system which was considered as the necessary 
consequence of the revolution begun by locke obtained 
a more complete ascendancy than it did in england and 
in that country too the reaction among metaphysical and 
moral writers when its time came was more decided and 
rapid than it was among lockes own countrymen it 
would appear that m laromiguierc was one of the first 
to give expression to this feeling of the necessity of a 
modification of the sensational philosophy he began by 
professing himself the disciple of condillac even while 
he was almost unconsciously subverting the fundamental 
principles of that writer and thus as m cousin justly

observes his opiiiious had the more powerful effect from 
being presented not as thwarting and coutradieting but 
as sharing and fouawing out the spirit of his age m 
laromiguieres work entitled mssai m le faculus d 
fame consists of lectures glyeu to the faculty of letters 
of the academy of paris in the years and 
 in the views which these lectures present there 
is much which the author has in common with condillae 
but he is led by his inyestigation to assertt that it is 
iiot true that sensatiou is the sole fundamental element 
of our thoughts and our undestandiug attention also is 
requisite and here we have au element of quite another 
icind for sensation is passive attetion is active at 
teution does not spring out of iseniiauon the passive 
principle is not the reason pf the active priuciple acti 
vity and passivity are two facts entirely dierent nor 
can this activity be defined or derived being as the 
author says a fundamental idea the distinction is 
manifest by its own nature and we may find evideqce of 
it in the very forms of language to look is more than 
to see to heathen is more than to hear the french 
language marks this distinctiou with respect to other 
senses also on wit et ton regarde on entend et ton 
eeoute on sent et ton flaire on goute et ton savoured 
and thus the mere sensation or capacity of feeling is 
only the occasion on which the attention is exercised 
while the attention is the fouudation of all the operation 
of the understanding 

the reader of the former part of this work will have 
seen how much we have insisted upon the activity of the 
mind as the necessary basis of all knowledge in all 
observation aud experience the mind is active and by its 
activity apprehends all sensations in subordination to its 
own ideas and thus it becomes eapable of collectiiig

knowledge fvom phenomena sinoe ideas involve general 
relations and connexions whieb sensations of themselves 
cannot involve and thus we see that in this respect 
also our philosophy stands at that point to which the 
speculations of the most reftective men have of late 
constantly been verging 

 m cousin himself from whom we have quoted 
the above account of laromiguire shares in this ten 
denoy and has argued very energetically and successfully 
against the doctrines of the sensational school he has 
made it his office once more to bring into notice among 
his countrymen the doctrine of ideas as the sources of 
knowledge and has revived the study of plato who may 
still be considered as one of the great leaders of the ideal 
school the large portion of m cousins works which 
refers to questions out of the reach of our present review 
makes it suitable not to dwell longer upon them in this 
place 

 we turn to speculations more closely connected 
with our present subject m ampere a french man of 
science well entitled by his extensive knowledge and 
large and profound views to deal with the philosophy of 
the sciences published in his esmi sur la philosth 
phie des sciences ou exposition andytique tun cloisifieation 
natureue de ioutes le connausances humaines in this 
remarkable work we see strong evidence of the progress 
of the reaction against the system which derives our 
knowledge from sensation only the author starts from 
a maxim that in classing the sciences we must not only 
regard the nature of the objects about which each science 
is concerned but also the point of view under which it 
considers them that is the ideas which each science 
involves m ampere also gives briefly his views of the 
intellectual constitution of man a subject on which he 
had long and sedulously employed his thoughts and

these views are fkr from belonging to the sensatiofnal 
school human thought he says is composed of pheno 
mena and of conceptions phenomena oxe extemal or 
sensitive and internal or active conceptions are of four 
kinds primitive as space and motion duration and cause 
objectivey as our idea of matter and substance onomaiic 
or those which we associate with the general terms which 
language presents to us and eaplicative by which we 
ascend to causes after a comparative study of phenomena 
he teaches further that in deriving ideas from sensation 
the mind is not passive but exerts an action which 
when voluntary is called attention but when it is as it 
often is involuntary may be termed reaction 

i shall not dwell upon the examination of these 
opinions but i may remark that both in the recogni 
tion of conceptions as an original and essential element 
of the mind and in giving a prominent place to the active 
function of the mind in the origin of our knowledge 
this view approaches to that which i have presented in 
the preceding part of this work although undoubtedly 
with considerable differences 

 the classification of the sciences which m ampere 
proposes is founded upon a consideration of the sciences 
themselves and is the author conceives in accordance 
with the conditions of natural classifications as exhibited 
in botany and other sciences it is of a more symmetri 
cal kind and exhibits more steps of subordination than 
that to which i have been led it includes also practical 
art as well as theoretical science and it is extended to 
moral and political as well as physical sciences it will 
not be necessary for me here to examine it in detail 
but i may remark that it is throughout a dichotomom 
division each higher number being subdivided into two

that cinematics the doctrine of motion without reference

which consider the mathematical properties of bodies

 reviews of opinions on knowledge 

among the metaphysicians of germany these philoso 
phers did not gradually modify and reject the dogmas of 
locke and condillac as was done in england and 
france nor did they endeavour to ascertain the extent 
of the empire of ideas by a careful survey of its several 
provinces as we have been doing in the previous part of 
the present work the german metaphysicians saw at 
once that ideas and things the subjective and the ob 
jective elements of our knowledge were by kants system 
brought into opposition and correlation as equally real 
and equally indispensable seeing this they rushed at 
once to the highest and most difficult problem of philo 
sophy — to determine what this correlation is — to dis 
cover how ideas and things are at the same time opposite 
and identical — how the world while it is distinct from 
and independent of us is yet as an object of our know 
ledge governed by the conditions of our thoughts the 
attempts to solve this problem taken in the widest sense 
including the forms which it assumes in morals politics 
the arts and religion as well as in the material sciences 
have since that time occupied the most profound specu 
lators of germany and have given rise to a number of 
systems which rapidly succeeding each other have each 
in its day been looked upon as a complete solution of 
the problem to trace the characters of these various 
systems does not belong to the business of the present 
book my task at present is ended when i have shown 
as i have now done how the progress of thought in the 
philosophical world followed from the earliest up to the 
present time has led to that recognition of the coexist 
ence and joint necessity of the two opposite elements of 

 the sensational system never acquired in germany the ascend 
ancy which it obtained in england and france but i am compelled

chapter i 
introduction 



 in the last book but one of this work we pointed 
out certain general characters of scientic knowledge 
which may often serve to distinguish it from opinions of 
a looser or vaguer kind in the last book we traced the 
steps by which men were led to a perception more or 
less clear of those characteristics and in the course of 
this review we had to consider various precepts and 
maxims offered by philosophers as fitted to guide us in 
the pursuit of exact and general truths other contri 
butions of tlie same kind to the philosophy of science 
might be noticed and some which contain more valuable 
suggestions and indicate a more practical acquaintance 
with the subject than any which have yet been quoted 
among these i must especially distinguish sir john 
herschels discourse on the study of natural philosophy 
but my object in this work is not so much to relate the 
history as to present the really valuable results of pre 
ceding labours i shall therefore proceed no further 
with the criticism of other authors but shall endeavour 
to collect both from them and from my own researches 
and reflections such views and such rules aa seem best

introduction 

adapted to assist us in the discovery and recognition of 
scientific truth or at least such as may enable us to 
understand the process by which this truth is obtained 
we would present to the reader the philosophy and if 
possible the art of discovery 

 but in truth we must acknowledge before we 
proceed with this subject that speaking with strictness 
an art of discovery is not possible — that we can give 
no rules for the pursuit of truth which shall be univer 
sally and peremptorily applicable — and that the helps 
which we can oflfer to the inquirer in such cases are 
limited and precarious still we trust it will be found 
that aids may be pointed out which are neither worthless 
nor uninstructive the mere classification of examples 
of successful inquiry to which our rules give occasion is 
full of interest for the philosophical speculator and if 
our maxims direct the discoverer to no operations which 
might not have occurred of themselves they may still 
concentrate our attention on that which is most important 
and characteristic in these operations and may direct us 
to the best mode of insuring their success i shall 
therefore attempt to resolve the process of discovery 
into its parts and to give an account as distinct as may 
be of rules and methods which belong to each portion 
of the process 

 in the eleventh book we considered the three 
main parts of the process by which science is constructed 
namely the decomposition and observation of complex 
facts the explication of our ideal conceptions and 
the colligation of elementary facts by means of those 
conceptions the first and last of these three steps are 
capable of receiving additional accuracy by peculiar pro 
cesses they may further the advance of science in a 
more effectual manner when directed by special technical 
methods of which in the present book we must give a

brief view in this more technical form the observation 
of facts involves the measuremeni of phenomena and the 
colligation of facts includes all arts and rules by which 
the process of induction can be assisted hence we 
shall have here to consider methods of otservatunh and 
methods of induction using these phrases in the widest 
sense the second of thq three steps above mentioned 
the explication of our conceptions does not admit of 
being much assisted by methods although something may 
be done by education and discussion 

 the methods of induction of which we have to 
speak apply only to the first step in our ascent from phe 
noraena to laws of nature — the discovery of laws of 
phenomena a higher and ulterior step remains behind 
and follows in natural order the discovery of laws of 
phenomena namely the discovery of causes and this 
must be stated as a distinct and essential process in a 
complete view of the course of science agiun when we 
have thus ascended to the causes of phenomena and of 
their laws we can often reason downwards from the 
cause so discovered and we are tlius led to suggestions of 
new phenomena or to new explanations of phenomena 
already known such proceedings may be termed appli 
cations of our discoveries including in the phrase veti 
fications of our doctrines by such an application of them 
to observed facts hence we have the following series of 
processes concerned in the formation of science 

 decomposition of facts 

 measurement of phenomena 

 explication of conception 

 induction of laws of phenomena 

 induction of causes 

 application of inductive discoveries 

 of these six processes the methods by which the 
second and fourth may be assisted are here our peculiar

introduction 

object of attention tte treatment of these subjects in 
the present work must necessarily be scanty and imper 
fect although we may perhaps be able to add something 
to what has hitherto been systematically taught on these 
heads methods of observation and of induction might 
of themselves form an abundant subject for a treatise 
and hereafter probably will do so in the hands of future 
writers a few remarks offered as contributions to this 
subject may serve to show how extensive it is and how 
much more ready it now is than it ever before was for a 
systematic discussion 

of the above steps of the formation of science the 
first the decomposition of facts has already been suffi 
ciently explained in the eleventh book for if we pur 
sue it into further detail and exactitude we find that we 
gradually trench upon some of the succeeding parts i 
therefore proceed to treat of the second step the mea 
surement of phenomena — of methods by which this work 
in its widest sense is executed and these i shall term 
methods of observation 



chapter ii 
of methods of observation 

 i shall speak in this chapter of methods of 
exact and systematic observation by which such facts 
are collected as form the materials of precise scientific 
propositions these methods are very various according 
to the nature of the subject inquired into and other cir 
cumstances but a great portion of them agree in being 
processes of measurement these i shall peculiarly con

 but though we have to explain how observations 
may be made as perfect as possible we must not forget 
that in most cases complete perfection is unattainable 
observations are never perfect for we observe pheno 
mena by our senses and measure their relations in time 
and space but our senses and our measures are all from 
various causes inaccurate if we have to observe the 
exact place of the moon among the stars how much of 
instrumental apparatus is necessary this apparatus has 
been improved by many successive generations of astro 
nomers yet it is still far from being perfect and the 
senses of man as well as his implements are limited in 
their exactness two different observers do not obtain 
precisely the same measures of the time and place of a 
phenomenon as for instance of the moment at which 
the moon occults a star and the point of her limb at 
which the occultation takes place here then is a 
source of inaccuracy and error even in astronomy where 
the means of exact observation are incomparably more 
complete than they are in any other department of human 
research in other cases the task of obtaining accurate 
measures is far more difficult if we have to observe the 
tides of the ocean when rippled with waves we can see 
the average level of the water first rise and then fall but 
how hard is it to select the exact moment when it is at 
its greatest height or the exact highest point which it 
reaches it is very easy in such a case to err by many 
minutes in time and by several inches in space 

still in many cases good methods can remove very 
much of this inaccuracy and to these we now proceed 

 i number — number is the first step of measure 
ment since it measures itself and does not like space and 
time require an arbitrary standard hence the first exact 
observations and the first advances of rigorous knowledge 
appear to have been made by means of number as for

example — the number of days in a month and in a year 
— the cycles according to which eclipses occur — the 
number of days in the revolutions of the planets and 
the like all these discoveries as we have seen in the 
history of astronomy go back to the earliest period of 
the science anterior to any distinct tradition and these 
discoveries presuppose a series probably a very long series 
of observations nmde principally by means of number 
nations so rude as to have no other means of exact mea 
surement have still systems of numeration by which they 
can reckon to a considerable extent very often such 
nations have very complex systems which are capable of 
expressing numbers of great magnitude number supplies 
the means of measuring other quantities by the assimip 
tion of a unit of measure of the appropriate kind but 
where nature supplies the unit number is applicable di 
rectly and immediately number is an important element 
in the classificatory as well as in the mathematical 
sciences the history of those sciences shows how the 
formation of botanical systems was effected by the adop 
tion of number as a leading element by csesalpinus and 
how afterwards the reform of linnaeus in classifica 
tion depended in a great degree on his finding in the 
pistils and stamens a better nimierical basis than those 
before employed in like manner the number of rays 
in the membrane of the gills and the number of rays in 
the fins of fish were found to be important elements in 
ichthyological classification by artedi and linnaeus 
there are innumerable instances in all parts of natural 
history of the importance of the observation of number 
and in this observation no instrument scale or standard 
is needed or can be applied except the scale of natural 
numbers expressed either in words or in figures can be 
considered as an instrument

 ii measurement of space — of quantities admit 
ting of continuous increase and decrease for number is 
discontinuous space is the most simple in its mode of 
measurement and requires most frequently to be mea 
sured the obvious mode of measuring space is by the re 
peated application of a material measure as when we take a 
footrule and measure the length of a room and in this 
case the footrule is the unit of space and the length of the 
room is expressed by the number of such units which it 
contains or as it may not contain an exact number by 
a number with b fraction but besides this measurement 
of linear space there is another kind of space which for 
purposes of science it is still more important to measure 
namely angular space the visible heavens being consi 
dered as a sphere the portions and paths of the heavenly 
bodies are determined by drawing circles on the surfiaco 
of this sphere and are expressed by means of the parts 
of these circles thus intercepted by such measures the 
doctrines of astronomy were obtained in the very be 
ginning of the science the arcs of circles thus mea 
sured are not like linear spaces reckoned by means of 
an arbitrary unit for there is a natwral umt the total 
circumference to which all arcs may be referred for 
the sake of convenience the whole circumference is 
divided into parts or degrees and by means of these 
degrees and their parts all arcs are expressed the ares 
are the measures of the angles at the centre and the 
degrees may be considered indifferently as measuring the 
one or the other of these quantities 

 in the history of astronomy i have described 
the method of observation of celestial angles employed by 
the greeks they determined the lines in which the 
heavenly bodies were seen by means either of shadows 
or of sights and measured the angles between such lines 

 sitiindsa

methods of observation 

by arcs or rules properly applied to them the armill 
astrolabe dioptra and parallactic instrument of the 
ancients were some of the instruments thus constructed 
tycho brahe greatly improyed the methods of astrono 
mical observation by giving steadiness to the frame of his 
instruments which were large quadrants and accuracy 
to the divisions of the ami but the application of the 
telescope to the astronomical quadrant and the fixation of 
the centre of the field by a cross of fine wires placed in the 
focus was an immense improvement of the instrument 
since it substituted a precise visual ray pointing to the star 
instead of the coarse coincidence of sights the accuracy 
of observationwas still further increased by applying to the 
telescope a micrometer which might subdivide the smaller 
divisions of the arc 

 by this means the precision of astronomical obser 
vation was made so great that very minute angular spaces 
could be measured and it then became question 
whether discrepancies which appeared at first as defects 
in the theory might not arise sometimes from a bending 
or shaking of the instrument and from the degrees marked 
on the limb being really somewhat unequal instead of 
being rigorously equal accordingly the framing and 
balancing of the instrument so as to avoid all possible 
tremor or flexure and the exact division of an arc into 
equal parts became great objects of those who wished to 
improve astronomical observations the observer no 
longer gazed at the stars from a lofty tower but placed 
his telescope on the solid ground and braced and balanced 
it with various contrivance instead of a quadrant an 
entire circle was introduced by ramsden and various 
processes were invented for the dividing of instruments 
among these we may notice troughtons method of di 
viding in which the visual ray of a microscope was substi

tuted for the points of a pair of compasses and by stepping 
round the circle the partial arcs were made to bear their 
exact relation to the whole circumference 

 astronomy is not the only science which depends 
on the measurement of angles crystallography also 
requires exact measures of this kind and the goniometery 
especially that devised by wouaston supplies the means 
of obtaining such measures the science of optics also 
in many cases requires the measurement of angles 

 in the measurement of linear space there is no 
natural standard which offers itself most of the common 
measures appear to be taken fromfsome part of the human 
body as a foot a cvbity a fathom but such measures 
cannot possess any precision and are altered by conven 
tion thus there were in ancient times many kinds of 
cubits arid in modern europe there are a great number 
of different standards of the foot as the rhenish foot 
the paris ot the english foot it is very desirable that 
if possible some permanent standard founded in nature 
should be adopted for the conventional measures are 
lost in the course of ages and thus dimensions expressed 
by means of them become unintelligible two different 
natural standards have beeii employed in modem times 
the french have referred their measures of length to the 
total circumference of a meridian of the earth a quadrant 
of this meridian consists of ten million units or metres 
the english have fixed their linear measure by reference 
to the length of a pendulum which employs an exact 
second of time in its small osillation both these methods 
occasion considerable diflsculties in carrying them into 
effect and are to be considered mainly as means of recover 
ing the standard if it should ever be lost for common 
purposes some material standard is adopted as authority 
for the time for example the standard which in england 
possessed legal authority up to the year was pre

served in the house of parliament and was lost in the 
conflagration which destroyed that edifice the standard 
of length now generally referred to by men of science 
in england is that which is in the possession of the astro 
nomical society of london 

 a standard of length being established the artifices 
for applying it and for subdividing it in the most accurate 
manner are nearly the same as in the case of measures of 
arcs as for instance the employment of the visual rays 
of microscopes instead of the legs of compasses and the 
edges of rules the use of micrometers for minute mea 
surements and the like many different modes of avoid 
ing error in such measurements have been devised by 
various observers accordinjg to the nature of the cases 
with which they had to deal 

 iii measurement of time — the methods of 
measuring time are not so obvious as the methods of 
measuring space for we cannot apply one portion of time 
to another so as to test their equality we are obliged 
to begin by assuming some change as the measure of time 
thus the motion of the sun in the sky or the length and 
position of the shadows of objects were the first modes 
of measuring the parts of the day but what assurance 
had men or what could they have that the motion of the 
sun or of the shadow was uniform they could have no 
such aiurance till they had adopted some measure of 
smaller times which smaller times making up larger times 
by repetition they took as the standard of uniformity— 
for example an hourglass or a clepsydra which answered 
the same purpose among the ancients there is no appa 
rent reason why the successive periods measured by the 
emptying of the hourglass should be unequal they are 

 on tlic precautions employed in astronomical instruments for the 
measure of space see sir j herschels astronom in the cahinet 
cijclopcedia art —

 methods employed in the formation op science 

implicitly accepted as equal and by reference to these 
the uniformity of the sun motion may be verified but 
the great improvement in the measurement of time was 
the use of a pendulunj for the purpose by galileo and 
the application of this device to clocks by huyghens in 
 for the successive oscillations of a pendulum are 
rigorously equal and a clock is only a train of machinery 
employed for the purpose of counting these oscillations 
by means of this invention the measure of time in astro 
nomical observations became as accurate as the measure 
of space 

 what is the natural unit of time it was assumed 
from the first by the greek astronomers that the sidereal 
days measured by the revolution of a star from any me 
ridian to the same again are exactly equal and all im 
provements in the measure of time tended to confirm this 
assumption the sidereal day is therefore the natural 
standard of time but the solar day determined by the 
diurnal revolution of the sun although not rigorously 
invariable as the sidereal day is undergoes scarcely any 
perceptible variation and since the course of daily occur 
rences is regulated by the sun it is far more convenient 
to seek the basis of our unit of time in his motions 
accordingly the solar day the mean solar day is divided 
into hours and these into minutes and seconds and 
this is our scale of time of such time the sidereal day 
has hours minutes seconds and it is plain 
that by such a statement the length of the hour is fixed 
with reference to a sidereal day the standard of time 
and the standard of space in like manner equally answers 
its purpose whether or not it coincides with any tvhole 
number of units 

 since the sidereal day is thus the standard of our 
measures of time it becomes desirable to refer to it con 
stantly and exactly the instruments by which timq

methods of obsbrvatiok 

measured in order that we may secure ourselves against 
error for this purpose in astronomical observatories ob 
servations are constantly made of the transit of stars across 
the meridian the transit imtrument with which this is done 
being adjusted with all imaginable regard to accuracy 

 when exact measures of time are required in 
other than astronomical observations the same instru 
ments are still used namely clocks and chronometers 
in chronometers the regulating part is an oscillating 
body not as in clocks a pendulum oscillating by the 
force of gravity but a wheel swinging to and fro on its 
centre in consequence of the vibrations of a slender coil 
of elastic wire to divide time into still smaller portions 
than these vibrations other artifices are used some of 
which will be mentioned under the next head 

 iv conversion of space and tvm— space and 
time agree in being extended quantities which are made 
up and measured by the repetition of homogeneous parts 
if a body move uniformly whether in the way of revolv 
ing or otherwise the space which any point describes is 
proportional to the time of its motion and the space and 
the time may each be taken as a measure of the other 
hence in such cases by taking space instead of time 
or time instead of space we may often obtain more con 
venient and precise measures than we can by measuring 
directly the element with which we are concerned 

the most prominent example of such a conversion is 
the measurement of the bight ascension of stars that 
is their angular distance from a standard meridian f on 
the celestial sphere by means of the time employed in 
their coming to the meridian of the place of observation 

 on the precautions employed in the measure of time by astrono 
mers see hbrschbls astnmy art — 

t a meridian is a circle passing through the poles about which the 
celestial sphere revolves the meridian of any place on the earth is 
that meridian vrhich is exactly over the place 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

since as we have already stated the visible celestial 
sphere carrying the fixed stars revolves with perfect uni 
formity about the pole if we observe the stars as they 
cpme in succession to a fixed circle passing through the 
poles the intervals of time between these observations 
will be proportional to the angles which the meridian 
circles passing through these stars make at the poles 
where they meet and hence if we have the means of 
measuring time with great accuracy we can by watching 
the times of the transits of successive stars across some 
visible mark in our own meridian determine the angular 
distances of the meridian circles of all the stars from one 
another 

accordingly now that the pendulum clock affords 
astronomers the means of determining time exactly a 
measurement of the right ascensions of heavenly bodies 
by means of a clock and a transit instrument is a part of 
the regular business of an observatory if the sidereal 
clock be so adjusted that it marks the beginning of its 
scale of time when the first point of right ascension is 
upon the visible meridian of our observatory the point 
of the scale at which the clock points when any other 
star is in our meridian will truly represent the right 
ascension of the star 

thus as the motion of the stars is our measure of 
time we employ time conversely as our measure of the 
places of the stars the celestial machine and our ter 
restrial machines correspond to each other in their move 
ments and the star steals silently and steadily across our 
meridian line just as the pointer of the clock steals past 
the mark of the hour we may judge of the scale of 
this motion by considering that the full moon employs 
about two minutes of time in sailing across any fixed line 
sden against the sky transverse to her path and all the 
celestial bodies carried along by the revolving sphere 
travel at the same rate

methods op observation 

 in this case up to a certain degree we render 
our measures of astronomical angles more exact and 
convenient by substituting time for space but when in 
the very same kind of observation we wish to proceed 
to a greater degree of accuracy we find that it is best 
done by substituting space for time in observing the 
transit of a star across the meridian if we have the clock 
•within hearing we can count the beats of the pendulum 
by the noise which they make and tell exactly at which 
second of time the passage of the star across the visible 
thread takes place and thus we measure right ascen 
sion by means of time but our perception of time does 
not allow us to divide a second into ten parts and to pro 
nounce whether the transit takes place threetenths six 
tenths or seventenths of a second after the preceding 
beat of the clock this however can be done by the 
usual mode of observing the transit of a star the 
observer listening to the beat of his clock fastens his 
attention upon the star at each beat and especially at 
the one immediately before and the one immediately 
after the passage of the thread and by this means he 
has these two positions and the positions of the thread so 
far present to his intuition at once that he can judge in 
what proportion the thread is nearer to one position than 
than the other and can thus divide the intervening second 
in its due proportion thus if he observe that at the 
beginning of the second the star is on one side of the 
thread and at the end of the second on the other side 
and that the two distances from the thread are as two to 
three he knows that the transit took place at twofifths 
or fourtenths of a second after the former beat in 
this way a second of time in astronomical observations 
may by a skilful observer be divided into ten equal parts 
although when time is observed as time a tenth of a 
second appears almost to escape our senses from the 
above explanation it will be seen that the reason why 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the fobmatiok op science 

the subdivision is possible in the way thus described is 
this — that the moment of time thus to be divided is so 
small that the eye and the mind can retain to the end of 
this moment the impression of position which it received 
at the beginning though the two positions of the star 
and the intermediate thread are seen successively they 
can be contemplated by the mind as if they were seen 
simultaneously and thus it is precisely the smallness of 
this portion of time which enables us to subdivide it by 
means of space 

 there is another case of somewhat a different 
kind in which time is employed in measuring space 
namely when space or the standard of space is defined 
by the length of a pendulum oscillating in a given time 
we might in this way define any space by the time which 
a pendulum of such a length would take in oscillating 
and thus we might speak as was observed by those who 
suggested this device of five minutes of cloth or a rope 
half an hour long we may observe however that in 
this case the space is not proportional to the time and 
we may add that though we thus appear to avoid the 
arbitrary standard of space for as we have seen the 
standard of measures of time is a natural one we do not 
do so in fact for we assume the invariableness of gravity 
which really varies though very slightly from place to 
place 

 v the method of repetition in measurement 
—in many cases we can give great additional accuracy 
to our measurements by repeatedly adding to itself the 
quantity which we wish to measure thus if we wished 
to ascertain the exact breadth of a thread it might not 
be easy to determine whether it was oneninetieth or one 
ninetyfifth or onehundredth part of an inch but if we 
find that ninetysix such threads placed side by side 
occupy exactly an inch we have the precise measure of 
the breadth of the thread in the same manner if two

clocks are going nearly at the same rate we may not be 
able to distinguish the excess of an oscillation of one of 
the pendulums over an oscillation of the other but when 
the two clocks have gone for an hour one of them may 
have gained ten seconds upon the other thus showing 
that the proportion of their times of oscillation is 
to 

in the latter of these instances we have the principle 
of repetition truly exemplified because as has been 
justly observed by sir j herschel there is then a 
juxtaposition of units without error — one vibration 
commences exactly where the last terminates no part of 
time being lost or gained in the addition of the units so 
counted in space this juxtaposition of units without 
error cannot be rigorously accomplished since the imits 
must be added together by material contact as in the 
case of the threads or in some equivalent manner yet 
the principle of repetition has been applied to angular 
measurement with considerable success in bordas re 
peating circle in this instrument the angle between 
two objects which we have to observe is repeated along 
the graduated limb of the circle by turning the telescope 
from one object to the other alternately fastened to the 
circle by its damp and loose from it by unclamping 
in this manner the errors of graduation may theore 
tically be entirely got rid of for if an angle repeated 
nine times be found to go twice round the circle it must 
be exactly eighty degrees and where the repetition does 
not give an exact number of circumferences it may still 
be made to subdivide the error to any required extent 

 connected with the principle of repetition is the 
method of coincidences or interferences if we have two 
scales on one of which an inch is divided into and 
on the other into equal parts and if these scales 

 tm nat phil art 
vol ii k

 methods employed in the formation of science 

being placed side by ide it appear that the beginning of 
the latter scale is between the nd and rd division of 
the former it may not be apparent what fraction added 
to determines the place of beginning of the second 
scale as measured on the first but if it appear also 
that the rd division of the second scale coifwides with a 
certain division of the first the th it is certain that 
and tkreetenths is the eaact place of the beginning of the 
second scale measured on the first scale the rd 
division of the scale will coincide or interfere with 
a division of the scale when the beginning or zero of 
the divisions is threetenths of a division beyond tlie 
preceding line of the scale as will be plain on a 
little consideration and if we have two scales of equal 
units in which each unit is divided into nearly but not 
quite the same number of equal parts as and 
and and and one sliding on the other it will 
always happen that some one or other of the diviaon linee 
will coincide or very nearly coincide and thus the exact 
position of the beginning of one unit measured on the 
other scale is determined a sliding scale thus divided 
for the purpose of subdividing the units of that on which 
it slides is called a vefmiery from the name of its inventor 
 the same principle of coincidence or interfe 
rence is applied to the exact measurement of the length 
of time occupied in the oscillation of a pendulum if a 
detached pendulum of such a length as to swing in little 
less than a second be placed before the seconds pendu 
lum of a clock and if the two pendulums begin to move 
together the former will gain upon the latter and in a 
little while their motions will be quite discordant but 
if we go on watching we shall find them after a time 
to agree again exactly namely when the detached pen 
dulum has gained one complete oscillation back and 
forwards upon the clock pendulum and again coincides

with it in its motion if this happen after minutes 
ve know that the times of oscillation of the two pen 
dulums are in the proportion of to and there 
fore the detached pendulum oscillates in of a second 
the accuracy which can be obtained in the measure of 
an oscillation by this means is great for the clock can 
be compared by observing transits of the stars or other 
wise with the natural standard of time the sidereal day 
and the moment of coincidence of the two pendulums 
may by proper arrangements be very exactly determined 
we have hitherto spoken of methods of measuring 
time and space but other elements also may be very 
precisely measured by various means 

 vi measurement of weight— weight like 
space and time is a quantity made up by addition of 
parts and may be measured by similar methods the 
principle of repetition is applicable to the measurement 
of weight for if two bodies be put in the same pan of a 
balance their weights are exactly added 

there may be difficulties of practical workmanship in 
carrying into effect the mathematical conditions of a per 
fect balance for example in securing an exact equality 
of the effective arms of the beam in all positions these 
difficulties are evaded by the metiod of double weighing 
according to which the standard weights and the body 
which is to be weighed are successively put in the same 
pan and made to balance by a third body in the opposite 
scale by this means the different lengths of the arms 
of the beam and other imperfections of the balance 
become of no consequence 

 there is no natural standard of weight the 
conventional weight taken as the standard is the weight 
of a given bulk of some known substance for instance

 vii measurement of secondary qualities — we 
have already seen that secondary qualities are estimated 
by means of conventional scales which refer them to 
space number or some other definite expression thus 
the thermometer measures heat the musical scale with 
or without the aid of number expresses the pitch of a 
note and we may have an exact and complete scale of 
colours pure and impure we may remark however 
that with regard to sound and colour the estimates of the 
ear and the eye are not superseded but only assisted 
for if we determine what a note is by comparing it with 
an instrument known to be in tune we still leave the ear 
to decide when the note is in unison with one of the notes 
of the instrument and when we compare a colour with 
our chromatometer we judge by the eye which division 
of the chromatometer it matches colour and sound have 
their natural scales which the eye and ear habitually 
apply what science requires is that those scales should 
be systematized we have seen that several conditions 
are requisite in such scales of qualities the observers 
skill and ingenuity are mainly shown in devising such 
scales and methods of applying them 

 the method of coincidences is employed in har 
monics for if two notes are nearly but not quite in 
unison the coincidences of the vibrations produce an 
audible undulation in the note which is called the howl 
and the exactness of the unison is known by this howl 
vanishing 

 viii manipulation — the process of applying 
practically methods of experiment and observation is 

 book iii c of the measure of secondary qualities

methods of observation 

termed manipulation and the value of observations 
depends much upon the proficiency of the observer m 
this art this skill appears as we have said not only in 
devising means and modes of measuring results but also 
in inventing and executing arrangements by which ele 
ments are subjected to such conditions as the investiga 
tion requires in finding and using some material combi 
nation by which nature shall be asked the question which 
we have in our minds to do this in any subject may be 
considered as a peculiar art but especially in chemistry 
where many experiments and even whole trains of 
research are essentially dependent for success on mere 
manipulation the changes which the chemist has to 
study — compositions decompositions and mutual actions 
affecting the internal structure rather thian the external 
form and motion of bodies — are not familiarly recognized 
by common observers as those actions are which operate 
upon the total mass of a body and hence it is only when 
the chemist has become to a certain degree familiar 
with his science that he has the power of observing he 
must learn to interpret the effects of mixture heat and 
other chemical agencies so as to see in them those facts 
which chemistry makes the basis of her doctrines and 
in learning to interpret this language he must also learn 
to call it forth — to place bodies under the requisite con 
ditions by the apparatus of his own laboratory and the 
operations of his own fingers to do this with readiness 
and precision is as we have said an art both of the 
mind and of the hand in no small degree recondite and 
difficult a person may be well acquainted with all the 
doctrines of chemistry and may yet fail in the simplest 
experiment how many precautions and observances 
what resource and invention what delicacy and vigilance 

 faradays chemical manipulatmiy p 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

are requisite in chemical manipulation may be seen by 
reference to dr faradays work on that subject 

 the same qualities in the observer are requisite 
in some other departments of science for example in 
the researches of optics for in these after the first 
broad facts have been noticed the remaining features of 
the phenomena are both very complex and very minute 
and require both ingenuity in the invention of experi 
ments and a keen scrutiny of their results we have 
instances of the application of these qualities in most of 
the optical experimenters of recent times and certainly in 
no one more than sir david brewster omitting here all 
notice of his succeeding labours his treatise on new phi 
lasophical instruments published in is an excellent 
model of the kind of resource and skill of which we now 
speak i may mention as an example of this skill his 
mode of determining the refractive power of an irregtilar 
fragment of any transparent substance at first this 
might appear an impossible problem for it would seem 
that a regular and smooth surface are requisite in nrder 
that we may have any measurable refraction but sir 
david brewster overcame the difficulty by immersing the 
fragment in a combination of fluids so mixed that they 
had the same refractive power as the specimen the 
question when they had this power was answered by no 
ticing when the fragment became so transparent that its 
surface could hardly be seen for this happened when 
the refractive power within and without the frttgment 
being the same there was no refraction at the surface 
and this condition being obtained the refractive power 
of the fluid and therefore of the fragment was easily 
ascertained 

 ix the education of the senses — colour and 
musical tone are as we have seen determined by means 
of the senses whether or not systematical scales are 



digitized by vjooq ic 



mbthods of observation 

used in expressing the observed fact systematicij scales 
of sensible qualities however not only give precision to 
the record but to the observation btit for this purpom 
such an education of the senses is requisite as may 
enable us to apply the scale immediately the memory 
must retain the sensation or perception to which the 
technical term or degree of the scale refers thus with 
regard to colour as we have said already when we find 
such terms as tinwhite or pinchbeckbrowny the metallic 
colour so denoted ought to occur at once to our recollec 
tion without delay or search the observers senses 
therefore must be educated at first by an actual exhibi 
tion of the standard and afterwards by a familiar use of 
it to understand readily and clearly each phrase and 
degree of the scales which in his observations he has to 
apply this is not only the best but in many cases the 
only way in which the observation can be expressed 
thus glassy htsire fatty lustre adamantine lustre denote 
certain kinds of shining in minerals which appearances 
we should endeavour iti vain to describe by periphrasis 
and which the terms if considered as terms in common 
language would by no means clearly discriminate for who 
in common language would say that coal has a fatty 
lustre but these terms in their conventional sense are 
perfectly definite and when the eye is once familiarized 
with this application of them are easily and clearly intel 
ligible 

 the education of the senses which is thus requi 
site in order to understand well the terminology of any 
science must be acquired by an inspection of the objects 
which the science deals with and is perhaps best pro 
moted by the practical study of natural history in the 
different departments of natural history the descriptions 
of species are given by means of an extensive techuicid 
 book viii c temiinology 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

terminology and that education of which we now speak 
ought to produce the effect of making the observer as 
familiar with each of these terms as we are with the 
words of our common language the terms have a much 
more precise meaning than other terms since they are 
defined by express convention and not learnt by common 
usage merely yet though they are thus defined not the 
definition but the perception itself is that which the term 
suggests to the proficient 

in order to use the terminology to any good purpose 
the student must possess it not as a dictionary but as a 
language the terminology of his sciences must be the 
natural historians most familiar tongue he must learn 
to think in such language and when this is achieved 
the terminology as i have elsewhere said though to an 
uneducated eye cumbrous and pedantical is felt to be a 
useful implement not an oppressive burden the im 
patient schoolboy looks upon his grammar and vocabulary 
as irksome and burdensome but the accomplished stu 
dent who has learnt the language by means of them 
knows that they have given him the means of expressing 
what he thinks and even of thinking more precisely 
and as the study of language thus gives precision to the 
thoughts the study of natural history and especially of 
the descriptive part of it gives precision to the senses 

the education of the senses is also greatly promoted 
by the practical pursuit of any science of experiment and 
observation as chemistry or astronomy the methods of 
manipulating of which we have just spoken in chemistry 
and the methods of measuring extremely minute portions 
of space and time which are employed in astronomy and 
which are described in the former part of this chapter are 
among the best modes of educating the senses for purposes 
of scientific observation

 by the various methods of precise observation 
which we have thus very briefly described facts are col 
lected of an exact and definite kind they are then bound 
together in general laws by the aid of general ideas and 
of such methods as we have now to consider it is true 
that the ideas which enable us to combine facts into 
general propositions do commonly operate in our minds 
while we are still engaged in the oflice of observing 
ideas of one kind or other are requisite to connect our 
phenomena into facts and to give meaning to the terms 
of our descriptions and it frequently happens that long 
before we have collected all the facts which induction 
requires the mind catches the suggestion which some of 
these ideas offer and leaps forwards to a conjectural law 
while the labour of observation is yet unfinished but 
though this actually occurs it is easy to see that the 
process of combining and generalizing facts is in the 
order of nature posterior to and distinct from the pro 
cess of observing cts not only is this so but there is 
an intermediate step which though inseparable from all 
successful generalization may be distinguished from it in 
our survey and may in some degree be assisted by 
peculiar methods to the consideration of such methods 
we now proceed 



chapter iii 

of methods of acquiring clear scientific 

ideas and first of intellectual 

education 

the ways in which men become masters of those 
clear and yet comprehensive conceptions which the for 
mation and reception of science require are mainly two 
which although we cannot reduce them to any exact 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

scheme we may still in a loose use of the term call 
methodi of acquiring clear ideas these two ways are 
education and discussion 

 i idea of spojce — it is easily seen that education 
may do at least something to render our ideas distinct 
and precise to learn geometry in youth tends mani 
ftly to render our idea of space clear and exact by 
such an education all the relations all the consequences 
of this idea come to be readily and steadily apprehended 
and thus it becomes easy for us to understand portions of 
science which otherwise we should by no means be able 
to comprehend the conception of similar triangles was 
to be mastered before the disciples of thales could see 
the validity of his method of determining the height of 
lofty objects by the length of their shadows the con 
ception of the sphere with its circles had to become familiar 
before the annual motion of the sun and its influence upon 
the lengths of days could be rightly traced the proper 
ties of circles combined with the pure doctrine motimt 
were required as an introduction to the theory of epicy 
cles the properties of conic sections were needed as a 
pipeparation for the discoveries of kepler and not only 
was it necessary that men should possess a knowledge of 
certain figures and their properties but it was equally 
necessary that they should have the habit of reasoning with 
perfect steadiness precision and conclusiveness concern 
ing the relations of space no small discipline of the 
mind is requisite in most cases to accustom it to go 
with complete insight and security through the demon 
strations respecting intersecting planes and lines dihedral 
and trihedral angles which occur in solid geometry yet 
how absolutely necessary is a perfect mastery of such 
reasonings to him who is to explain the motions of the 
moon in latitude and longitude how necessary agmn

is the same fbcnlty to the student of crystallographj 
without mathematical habits of conception and of think 
ing these portions of science are perfectly inaccessiblew 
but the eariy study of plane and solid geometry gives to 
all tolerably gifted persons the habits which are thus 
needed the discipline of following the reasonings of 
didactic works on this subject till we are quite familiar 
with them and of devising for ourselves reasonings of the 
same kind as for instance the solutions of problems 
proposed soon gives the mind the power of discoursing 
with perfect facility concerning the most complex and 
multiplied relations of space and enables us to refer to 
the properties of all plane and solid figures as surely as 
to the visible forms of objects thus we have here a 
signal instance of the efficacy of education in giving to 
our conceptions that clearness which the formation and 
existence of science indispensably require 

 it is not my intention here to enter into the details 
of the form which should be given to education in order 
that it may answer the purposes now contemplated but 
i may make a remark which the above examples naturally 
suggest that in a mathematical education considered as 
a preparation for furthering or understanding physical 
science geometry is to be cultivated fkr rather than 
algebra — the properties of space are to be studied and 
reasoned upon as they are in diemselves not as they are 
replaced and disguised by symbolical representations it 
is true that when the student is become quite familiar 
with elementary geometry he may often enable himself 
to deal in a more rapid and comprehensive manner with 
the relations of space by using the language of symbols 
and the principles of symbolical calculation but this is 
an ulterior step which may be added to but can never 
be substituted for the direct cultivation of geometry 
the method of symbolical reasoning employed upon sub

jects of geometry and mechanics has certainly achieved 
some remarkable triumphs in the treatment of the theory 
of the universe these successful applications of symbols 
in the highest problems of physical astronomy appear to 
have made some teachers of mathematics imagine that it 
is best to begin the pupils course with such symbolical 
generalities but this mode of proceeding will be so far 
from giving the student clear ideas of mathematical rela 
tions that it will involve him in utter confusion and 
probably prevent his ever obtaining a firm footing in geo 
metry to commence mathematics in such a way would 
be much as if we should begin the study of a language by 
reading the highest strains of its lyrical poetry 

 ii idea of number sfc — the study of mathe 
matics as i need hardly observe develops and renders 
exact our conceptions of the relations of number as well 
as of space and although as we have already noticed 
even in their original form the conceptions of number are 
for the most part very distinct they may be still further 
improved by such discipline in complex cases a metho 
dical cultivation of the mind in such subjects is needed 
for instance questions concerning cycles and intercala 
tions and epacts and the like require very great steadi 
ness of arithmetical apprehension in order that the rea 
soner may deal with them rightly in the same manner 
a mastery of problems belonging to the science of pure 
motion or as i have termed it mechanism requires 
either great natural aptitude in the student or a mind 
properly disciplined by suitable branches of mathematical 
study 

 arithmetic and geometry have long been standard 
portions of the education of cultured persons throughout 
the civilized world and hence all such persons have 
been able to accept and comprehend those portions of 
science which depend upon the idea of space for instance

intellectual education 

the doctrine of the globular form of the earth with its 
consequences such as the measures of latitude and longi 
tude — the heliocentric system of the universe in modern 
or the geocentric in ancient times — the explanation of 
the rainbow and the like in nations where there is no 
such education these portions of science cannot exist as 
a part of the general stock of the knowledge of society 
however intelligently they may be pursued by single 
•philosophers dispersed here and there in the community 
 iii idea of force — as the idea of space is 
brought out in its full evidence by the study of geometry 
so the idea of force is called up and developed by the study 
of the science of mechanics it has already been shown 
in our scrutiny of the ideas of the mechanical sciences 
that force the cause of motion or of equilibrium involves 
an independent fundamental idea and is quite incapable of 
being resolved into any mere modification of our concep 
tions of space time and motion and in order that the 
student may possess this idea in a precise and manifest 
shape he must pursue the science of mechanics in the 
mode which this view of its nature demands — that is 
he must study it as an independent science resting on 
solid elementary principles of its own and not built upon 
some other unmechanical science as its substructure he 
must trace the truths of mechanics from their own axioms 
and definitions these axioms and definitions being con 
sidered as merely means of bringing into play the idea 
on which the science depends the conceptions of force 
and matter of action and reaction of momentum and 
inertia with the reasonings in which they are involved 
cannot be evaded by any substitution of lines or symbols 
for the conceptions any attempts at such substitution 
would render the study of mechanics useless as a prepa 
ration of the mind for physical science and would in 
deed except counteracted by great natural clearness of

 methods employed in the formation op science 

thought on such subjects fill the mind with confused and 
yague notions quite unavailing for any purposes of sound 
reasoning but on the other hand the study of mecha 
nics in its genuine form as a branch of education is fitted 
to give a most useful and valuable precision of thought 
on such subjects and is the more to be recommended 
since in the general habits of most mens minds the 
mechanical conceptions are tainted with far greater ob 
scurity and perplexity than belongs to the conceptions of 
number space and motion 

 as habitually distinct conceptions of space and 
motion were requisite for the reception of the doctrines 
of formal astronomy the ptolemaic and copemican 
system so a clear and steady conception of force is 
indispensably necessary for understanding the newtonian 
system of physical astronomy it may be objected that 
the study of mechanics as a science has not commonly 
formed part of a liberal education in europe and yet 
that educated persons have commonly accepted the new 
tonian system but to this we reply that although most 
persons of good intellectual culture have professed to 
assent to the newtonian system of the universe yet they 
have in fact entertained it in so vague and perplexed a 
manner as to show very clearly that a better mental 
preparation than the usual one is necessary in order that 
such persons may really understand the doctrine of 
universal attraction i have already spoken of uie pre 
valent indistinctness of mechanical conceptions and 
need not here dwell upon the indications constantly 
occurring in conversation and in literature of the utter 
inaccuracy of thought on such subjects which may often 
be detected for instance in the mode in which many 
men speak of centrifugal and centripetal forces — of pro 
jectile and central forces — of the effect of the moon 
 vol i p

upon the waters of the ocean and the like the inco 
herence of ideas which we frequently witness on such 
points shows us clearly that in the minds of a great 
number of men well educated according to the present 
standard the acceptance of the doctrine of universal 
gravitation is a result of traditional prejudice not of 
rational conviction and those who are newtonians on 
such grounds are not at all more intellectually advanced 
by being newtonians in the nineteenth century than 
they would have been by being ptolemaics in the fif 
teenth 

 it is undoubtedly in the highest degree desirable 
that all great advances in science shotdd become the 
common property of all cultivated men and this can 
only be done by introducing into the course of a liberal 
education such studies as unfold and fix in mens minds 
the fundamental ideas upon which the new discovered 
truths rest the progress made by the ancients in geo 
graphy astronomy and other sciences led them to assign 
wisely and well a place to arithmetic and geometry 
among the steps of an ingenuous education the dis 
coveries of modem times have rendered these steps still 
more indispensable for we cannot consider a man as 
cultivated up to the standard of his times if he is not 
only ignorant of but incapable of comprehending the 
greatest achievements of the human intellect and as 
innumerable discoveries of all ages have thus secured to 
geometry her place as a part of good education so the 
great discoveries of newton make it proper to introduce 
elementary mechanics as a part of the same course if 
the education deserve to be called good the pupil will 
not remain ignorant of those discoveries the most remarb 
able extensions of the field of human knowledge which 
have ever occurred yet he cannot by possibility com 
prehend them except his mind be previously disciplined

by nechanical studies the period appears now to be 
arrived when we may venture or rather when we are 
bound to endeavour to include a new class of funda 
mental ideas in the elementary discipline of the human 
intellect this is indispensable if we wish to educe the 
powers which we know that it possesses and to enrich it 
with the wealth which lies within its reach 

 by the view which is thus presented to us of the 
nature and objects of intellectual education we are led 
to consider the mind of man as undergoing a progress 
from age to age by the discoveries which are made 
and by the clearness and evidence which after a time 
not suddenly nor soon the truths thus discovered 
acquire one portion of knowledge after another becomes 
elementary and if we would really secure this progress 
and make men share in it these new portions must be 
treated as elementary in the constitution of a liberal 
education even in the rudest forms of intelligence 
man is immeasurably elevated above the unprogressive 
brute for the idea of number is so far developed that he 
can count his flock or his arrows but when number is 
contemplated in a speculative form he has made a vast 
additional progress when he steadily apprehends the 
relations of space he has again advanced when in 
thought he carries these relations into the vault of the 
sky into the expanse of the universe he reaches a higher 
intellectual position and when he carries into these 
wide regions not only the relations of space and time 
but of cause and effect of force and reaction he has again 
made an intellectual advance which wide as it is at first 
is accessible to all and with which all should acquaint 
themselves if they really desire to prosecute with energy 
the ascending path of truth and knowledge which lies

before them this should be an object of exertion to all 
ingenuous and hopeful minds for that exertion is 
necessary — that after all possible facilities have been 
afforded it is still a matter of toil and struggle to appro 
priate to ourselves the acquisitions of great discoverers 
is not to be denied elementary medianics like elemen 
tary geometry is a study accessible to all but like that 
too or perhaps more than that it is a study which requires 
effort and contention of mind — a forced steadiness of 
thought it is long since one complained of this labour 
in geometry and was answered that in that region there 
is no royal road the same is true of mechanics and 
must be true of all branches of solid education but we 
should express the truth more appropriately in our days 
by saying that there is no popular road to these sciences 
in the mind as in the body strenuous exercise alone can 
give strength and activity the art of exact thought can 
be acquired only by the labour of close thinking 

 iv chemical ideas — we appear then to have 
arrived at a point of human progress in which a liberal 
education of the scientific intellect should include besides 
arithmetic elementary geometry and mechanics the 
question then occurs to us whether there are any other 
fundamental ideas among those belonging to other 
sciences which ought also to be made part of such an 
education — whether for example we should strive to 
develop in the minds of all cultured men the ideas of 
polarity mechanical and chemical of which we spoke in 
a former part of this work 

the views to which we have been conducted by the pre 
vious inquiry lead us to reply that it would not be well to 
make cawtw polarities at any rate a subject of elementary 
instruction for even the most profound and acute phi 
losophers who have speculated upon this subject — they 
who are leading the van in the march of discovery do

not seem yet to have reduced their thoughts on this 
subject to a consistency or to have taken hold of this idea 
of polarity in a manner quite satisfactory to their own 
minds this part of the sulject is therefore by no means 
ready to be introduced into a course of general elementary 
education for with a view to such a purpose nothings 
less than the most thoroughly luminous and transparent 
condition of the idea will suffice its whole efficacy 
as a means and object of disciplinal study depends upon 
there being no obscurity perplexity or indefiniteness with 
regard to it beyond that transient deficiency which at first 
exists in the learners minii and is to be removed by his 
studies the idea of chemical polarity is not yet in this 
condition and therefore is not yet fit for a place in edu 
cation yet since this idea of polarity is the most 
general idea which enters into chemistry and appears to 
be that which includes almost all the others it would be 
unphilosophical and inconsistent with all sound views of 
science to introduce into education some chemical con 
ceptions and to omit those which depend upon this idea 
indeed such a partial adoption of the science could hardly 
take place without not only omitting but misrepresenting 
a great part of our chemical knowledge the conclusion 
to which we are necessarily led therefore is this — that 
at present chemistry cannot with any advantage form a 
portion of a general intellectual education 

 v naturalhistoiy ideas — but there remains 
still another class of ideas with regard to which we may 
very properly ask whether they may not advantageously 
foim a portion of a liberal education i mean the ideas 

 i do not here stop to prove that an education if it be so called 
in which the memory only retains the verhal expression of rolts 
while the mind does not apprehend the principles of the subject and 
therefore cannot even understand the words in which its doctrines are 
oxptssed is of no value whatever to the intellect but rather is liighly

of definite leemhlance and difference and of one set 
of resemblances subordinate to another vhich form the 
baes of the olassificatorj sciences these ideas are 
developed by the study of the various branches of natural 
history as botany and zoology and beyond all doubt 
those pursuits if assiduously followed very materially 
affect the mental habits there is this obvious advantage 
to be looked for from the study of natural history con 
sidered as a means of intellectual discipline — that it 
gives us in a precise and scientific form examples of 
tlie clasiiig and naming of objects which operations the 
use of common language leads us constantly to perform 
n aloose and inexact way in the usual habits of our 
minds and tongues things are distinguished or brought 
together and names are applied in a manner very indefi 
nite vacillating and seemingly capricious and we may 
aturally be led to doubt whether such defects can be 
avoided — whether exact distinctions of things and rigo 
rous use of wordd be possible now upon this point we 
may receive the instruction of natural history which 
proves to us by the actual performance of the task that 
a precise classification and nomenclature are attainable 
at least for a mass of objects of the same kind further 
we also learn from this study that there may exist not 
only an exact distinction of kinds of things but a series 
of distinctions one set subordinate to another and the 
more general induding the more special so as to form a 
system of classification all these are valuable lessons 
if by the study of natural history we evolve in a clear 
and well defined form the conceptions of genus species 
and of higjier and lower steps of classification we commu 
nicate precision clearness and method to the intellect 
through a great range of its operations 

 it must be observed that in order to attain the 
disciplinal benefit which the study of natural history is

fitted to bestowi we must teach the naiurai not the aiii 
ficial dascahms or at least the natural as well as the 
artificial for it is important for the stodenfe to peroeire 
that there are classifications not merely arbitrary founded 
upon some ahfned character but naturd recognised by 
some discovered character he ou jt to see that our classes 
being collected according to one mark are confirmed by 
many marks not originally stated in our scheme and are 
thus found to be grouped together not by a single resem 
blance but by a mass of resemblances indicating s 
natural affinity that olrects may be collected into such 
groups is a highly important lesson which natural histoiy 
ulone pursued as the science of fuuural dasef can teach 
 natural history has not unfrequently been made 
a portion of education t and has in some degree produced 
such effects as we hato pointed out it would appear 
however that its lessons have in general been very im 
perfectly lewnt or understood by persons of general edu 
cation and that there are perverse intellectual habits 
very generally prevalent in the cultivated classes which 
ought ere now to have been corrected by the general 
teaching of natural history we may detect among 
speculative men many prejudices respecting the nature 
and rules of reasoning which arise from pure mathema 
tics having been so long and so universally the instrument 
of intellectual cultivation pure mathematics reasons 
from definitions whatever term is introduced into her 
pages as a eirdef or a square its definition comes along 
with it and this definition is supposed to supply all that 
the reasober needs to know respecting the term if 
there be any doubt concerning the validity of the conclu 
sion the doubt is resolved by recurring to the definitions 
hence it has come to pass that in other subjects also men 
seek for and demand definitions as the most secure foun 
dation of reasoning the definition and the term defined

are conceived to be so far identical that in all cafies the 
one may be substituted for the other and such a subiti 
tution is held to be the best mode of detecting fltllacies 

 it has been already shown that even geometry ii 
not founded upon definitions alone and we shall not 
here again analyse the fallacy of this belief in the supreme 
value of definitions but we may remark that the study 
of natural history appears to be the proper remedy for 
this erroneous habit of thought for in every department 
of natural history the object of our study is kindi of 
things not one of which kinds can be rigorously definedi 
yet all of them are sufficiently definite in these cases 
we may indeed give a specific description of one of the 
kinds and may call it a definition but it is clear that 
such a definition does not contain the essence of the 
thing we say that the rose tribe are polypetalous 
dicotyledons with lateral styles superior simple ovaria 
regular perigynous stamens exalbuminous definite seeds 
and alternate stipulate leaves but no one would say 
that this was our essential conception of a rose to be sub 
stituted for it in all cases of doubt or obscurity by way 
of making our reasonings perfectly clear not only so 
but as we have already seen f the definition does not evert 
apply to all the tribe for the stipule are absent in 
lowea the albumen is present in neillia the fruit of 
spiwea sorbifolia is capsular if then we can possess any 
certain knowledge in natural history which no cultiva 
tor of the subject will doubt it is evident that our know 
ledge cannot depend on the possibility of laying down 
exact definitions and reasoning from them 

 but it may be asked if we cannot define a word 
or a class of things which a word denotes how can we 
distinguish what it does mean from what it does not 
mean how can we say that it signifies one thing

 methods eiplyed ik the foemation of science 

rather than another except we declare what u its sig 
nification 

the answer to this question involves the general prin 
ciple of a natural method of classification which has 
already been stated and need not here be again dwelfe 
on it has been shown tat names of kinds of things 
genera associate them according to total resemblances 
tot partial characteis the principle which connects a 
group of objects in natural history is not a definition but 
a type thus we take as the type of the rose family it 
may be the common wild rose all species which resemble 
this more than they resemble any other group of species 
are also roses and form one genus all genera which 
resemble roses more than they resemble any other group 
of genera are of the same family and thus the rose 
jramily is collected about some one species which is the 
type or central point of the group 

in such an arrangement it may readily be conceived 
that though the nucleus of each group may cohere firmly 
together the outskirts of contiguous groups may approach 
and may even be intermingled so that some species may 
doubtfully adhere to one group or another yet this un 
certainty does not all affect the truths which we find our 
selves enabled to assert with regard to the general mas 
of each group and thus we aie taught that there may 
be very important differences between two groups of 
objects although we are unable to tell where the one 
group ends and where the other begins and that there 
may be propositions of indisputable truth in which it is 
impossible to give unexceptionable definitions of the 
terms employed 

 these lessons are of the highest value with 
regard to all employments of the human mind for the 
mode in which words in common use acquire their mean

intlectual education 

iugy approaches far more nearly to the method of type 
than to the method of definition the terms which belong 
to our practical concerns or to onr spontaneous and un 
scientific speculations are rarely capable of exact defini 
tion they have been devised in order to express asser 
fious often very important yet very vaguely conceived 
and the signification of the word is extended as far as the 
assertion conveyed by it can be extended by apparent 
connexion or by analogy and thus in all the attempts 
of man to grasp at knowledge we hietve an exemplification 
of that which we have stated as the rule of induction 
that definition iand proposition are mutually dependent 
each adjusted so as to give value and meaning to the 
other and this is so even when both the elements of 
truth are defective in precision the definition being re 
placed by an incomplete description or a loose reference 
to a type and the proposition being in a corresponding 
degree insecure 

 thus the study of natural history as a corrective 
of the belief that definitions are essential to substantial 
truth might be of great use and the advantage which 
might thus be obtained is such as well entitles this study 
to a place in a liberal qdoeation we may further 
observe that in order that latural history may produce 
such an efiect it must be studied by inspection of the 
obfects themselves and not by the reading of books only 
its lesson is that we must in all cases of doubt or obscu 
rity refer iot to words or definitions but to things the 
book of nature is its • dictionary it is there that the 
natural historian looks to find the meaning of the words 
which he uses so long as a plant in its most essential 

 it is a coriotis example of the inflaence of the belief in definitions 
that elementary books have been written in which natural histoiy ia 
taught in the way of question and answer and consequently by mena 
of words alone in such a scheme of course all objeots are defined and

partem is more like a rose than anything else it is a rose 
he knows no other definition 

 vi wdustmishl idea done to be used — 
we toay imsert in general what we have above stated 
speoitlly with referenee to the fundamental principles of 
chemistry — no ideas are suited to become the elements 
of dementary education till they have not only become 
perfectly distinct and fixed in the minds of the leading 
cultivators of the science to which they belong but till 
ttiey have been so for some considerable period the 
entire clearness and steadiness of view which is essential 
to sound science must have time to extend itself to a 
wide cirde of disciples the views and principles which 
are detected by the most profound and acute philosophers 
are soon appropriated by all the most intelligent mid 
active minds of their own and of the following genera 
tions and when this has taken place and not till then 
it is right by a proper constitution of our liberal educa 
tion to extend a general knowledge of such principles to 
all cultivated persons and it follows from this view of 
the matter that we are by no means to be in haste to 
adopt into our course of education all new discoveries 
as soon as they are made they require some time in 
order to settle into their proper place and position in 
mens minds and to show themselves under their true 
aspects and till this is done we confuse and disturb 
rather than eiilighten and unfold the ideas of learners 
by introducing the discoveries into our elementary instruc 
tion hence it was perhaps reasonable that a centurj 
should elapse from the time of galileo before the rigor 

we may eamly anticipate the take of the knowledge thus conreyed 
thus iron it a wellknown bard metal of a darkiah gray odlour and

intellectual educatiok 

ou teaching of mechanics became a general element of 
intellectual training and the doctrine of universal gra 
vitation was hardly ripe for such an employment till the 
end of the last century we must not direct the un 
formed youthful mind to launch its little bark upon the 
waters of speculation till all the agitation of discoyery 
with its consequent fluctuation and controversy has well 
subsided 

 but it may be asked how is it that time operates 
to give distinctness and evidence to scientific ideas in 
what way does it happen that views and principles 
obscure and wavering at first after a while become 
luminous and steady can we point out any process 
any intermediate steps by which this result is produced 
if we can this process must be an important portion of 
the subject now under our consideration 

to this we reply that the transition from the hesi 
tation and contradiction with which true ideas are first 
received to the general assent and clear apprehension 
which they afterwards obtain takes place through various 
arguments for and against them and various modes of 
presenting and testing them all which we may include 
under the term discussion which we have already men 
tioned as the second of the two ways by which scientiflo 
views are developed into full maturity

op methods of acquiring clear scientific 
ideas continued— of the discussion op ideas 

 it is easily seen that in every part of science the 
establishment of a new set of ideas has been accompanied 
with much of doubt and dissent and by means of dis

cusaions so oceasioned the new conceptions and the 
opinions mhich invidve them liave gradually become 
definite and clear the authors and asserters of the new 
opinions in order to make them defensible have been 
compelled to make them consistent in order to recom 
toend them to others they have been obliged to make 
them more entirely intelligible to themselves and thus 
the terms which formed the main points of the contro 
versy although applied in a loose and vacillating manner 
at first have in the end become perfectly definite and 
exact the opinions discussed have been in their main 
features the same throughout the debate but they havd 
at first been dimly and at last clearly apprehended 
like the objects of a landscape at which we look through 
a telescope ill adjusted till by sliding the tube backwards 
and forwards we at last bring it into focus and perceive 
every feature of the prospect sharp and bright 

 we have in the last book but one fully exem 
plified this gradual progress of conceptions fiom obscurity 
to clearness by means of discussion we have seen too 
that this mode of treating the subject has never been 
successful except when it has been associated with an 
appeal to facts as well as to reasonings a combination 
of experiment with ailment of observation with demon 
stration has always been found requisite in order that 
men should arrive at those distinct conceptions which 
give them substantial truths the arguments used led 
to the rejection of undefined ambiguous selfcontradictory 
notions but the reference to facts led to the selection or 
at least to the retention of the conceptions which were 
both true and useful the two correlative processes 
definition and true assertion the formation of clear ideas 
and the induction of laws went on together

thus those discassions by which scientific conceptions

to the former part of the process according to th

 in the scrutiny of the fundamental ideas of the 
sciences which forms the previous part of this work an 
in the hutory of the inductive sciences i have in several 
instances traced the steps by which historically speaking 
these ideas have obtained their ultimate and permanent 
place in the minds of speculative men i have thus 
exemplified the reasonings and controveries which conr 
stitute such discussion as we now speak of i have 
stated at considerable length the various attempts failt 
ures and advances by which the ideas which enter into 
the science of mechanics were evolved into their present 
evidence in like manner we have seen the conception 
of refracted rays of light obscure and confused in seneca 
growing clearer in roger bacon more ddsnite in defrr 
cartes perfectly distinct in newton the polarity of 
light at first contemplated with some perplexity became 
very distinct to malus young and fresnel yet the 
phenomena of circular polarization and still more the 
circular polarization of fluids leave us even at present 
some difficulty in fully mastering this conception the 
related polarities of electricity and magnetisna are not yet 
fully comprehended even by our greatest philosophers

result the controversy between biot and ampsre 
on the nature of the elementary forces in electrojmamic 
action is another evidence that the discussion of this 
subject has not yet reached its termination with regard 
to chemical polarity i have already stated that this idea 
is as yet very far from being brought to an ultimate con 
dition of definiteness and the subject of chemical forces 
for the whole subject must be included in this idea of 
polarity which has already occasioned much perplexity 
and controversy may easily occasion much more before it 
is settled to the satisfaction of the philosophical world 
the ideas of the classificatory sciences also have of late 
been undergoing much and very instructive discussion 
in the controversies respecting the relations and offices of 
the natural and artificial methods and with regard to 
physiological ideas it would hardly be too much to say 
that the whole history of physiology up to the present 
time has consisted of the discussion of the fundamental 
ideas of the science such as vital forces nutrition repro 
duction and the like we have had before us at some 
length in the present work a review of the opposite 
opinions which have been advanced jn this subject and 
have attempted in some degree to estimate the direction 
in which these ideas are permamently settling but 
without attaching any importance to this attempt the 
account there given may at least serve to show how 
important a share in the past progress of this subject the 
discussion of its fundamental ideas has hitherto had 

 there is one reflection which is very pointedly 
suggested by what has been said the manner in which 
our scientific ideas acquire their distinct and ultimata 
form being such as has been described — always involving 
much abstract reasoning and analysis of our conceptions 
often much opposite argumentation and debate — how

of dispute and controversy as frivolous and unprofitable

of facts 

yet some vmtera are accustomed to talk vrith con 
tempt of all past controversies and to wonder at the blind 
ness of those who did not at first take the view whidi 
was established at last such persons forget that it was 
precisely the controversy which established among specu 
lative men that final doctrine which they themselves have 
quietly accepted it is true they have had no difficulty 
in thoroughly adopting the truth but that has occurred 
because all dissentient doctrines have been suppressed 
and forgotten and because system and books and lan 
guage itself have been accommodated peculiarly to the 
expression of the accepted truth to despise those who 
have by their mental struggles and conflicts brought the 
subject into a condition in which error is almost out of 
our reach is to be ungrateful exactly in proportion to the 
amount of the benefit received it ia as if a child when 
its teacher had with many trials and much trouble pre 
pared a telescope so that the vision through it was dis 
tinot should wonder at his stupidity in pushing the tube 
of the eyeglass out and in so often 

 again some persons condemn all that we have 
here spoken of as the discusnon of ideas terming it meuh 
phtsical and in this spirit one writer has ioken of 
the metaphysical period of each science as preceding 
the period of positive knowledge but as we have 
seen that process which is here termed metaphysical 
•the analysis of our conceptions and the exposure of 
their inconsistencies — accompanied with the study of 
facts — has always gone on most actively in the most

prosperous periods of each science there is gilileo

the main difference is that the metaphysics is of ft better 
kind it is more conformable to inetaphjeical trutfa 
and the same is the case in other sciences nor can it 
be otherwise for all truth before it can be consient 
with facts must be consistent tfith itself and idthough 
this rule is of undeniable authority its implication is often 
far from easy the perplexities and ambiguities which 
arise from our having the same idea presented to us 
under different aspects are often difficult to disentangle 
and no common acuteness and steadiness of thought 
must be expended on the ta it would b aay to 
adduce from the works of all great discoverers passages 
more profoundly metaphysical than any which are to be 
found in the pages of barren a priori reasoners 

 as we have said these metaphysical discossions 
are not to be put in opposition to the study of facts but 
are to be stimulated nourished and directed by a con 
stant recourse to experiment and observation the cul 
tivation of ideas is to be conducted as having for its 
object the connexion of cts never to be pursued as a 
mere exercise of the subtilty of the mind striving to 
build up a world of its own and neglecting that which 
exists about us for although man may in this way please 
himself and admire the creations of his own brain he 
can never by this course hit upon the real scheme of 
nature with his ideas unfolded by education sharpened 
by controversy rectified by metaphysics he may under

mscussion of ideas 

having bere treated of education and discussion as 
the methods by which the former of these two processes 
is to be promoted we have now to explain the methods 
which science employs in order most successfully to 
execute the latter but the colligation of facts as 
already istated may offer to us two steps of a very different 
kind — the laws of phenomena and their causes we 
shall first describe some of the methods employed in 
obtaining truths of the former of these two kinds 



chapter v 
analysis of the process of induction 

sect i the three steps of induction 

 when facts have been decomposed and phenomena 
measured the philosopher endeavours to combine them 
into general laws by the aid of ideas and conceptions 
these being illustrated and regulated by such means m 
we have spoken of in the last two chapters in this task 
of gathering laws of nature from observed facts as we 
have already said the natural sagacity of gifted minds is 
the power by which the greater part of the successful 
results have been obtained and this power will probably 
always be more efficacious than any method can be 
still there are certain methods of procedure which may 
in such investigations give us no inconsiderable aid and 
these i shall endeavour to expound 

 for this purpose i remark that the colligation of 
ascertained facts into general propositions may be con 
sidered as containing three steps which i shall term the 
selection of the idea the construction of the conception 
and the determination of the magnitudes it will be recol

looted that by the word ideay or fundamental idea 
used in a peculiar sense i mean certain wide and general 
fields of intelligible relation such as space number 
cause likeness while by conception i denote more 
special modifications of these ideas as a cinie a square 
number a uniform force a like form of flower now in 
order to establish any law by reference to facts we must 
select the true idea and the true conception for exam 
ple when hipparchus found that the distance of the 
bright star spica virginis from the equinoxial point had 
increased by two degrees in about two hundred years 
and desired to reduce this change to a law he had first 
to assign if possible the idea on which it depended — 
whether it was regulated for instance by space or by 
time whether it was determined by the positions of other 
stars at each moment or went on progressively with the 
lapse of ages and when there was found reason to 
select tine as the regulative idea of this change it wm 
then to be determined how the change went on with the 
time — whether uniformly or in some other manner 
the conception or the rule of the progression was to be 
rightly constructed finally it being ascertained that 
the change did go on uniformly the question then occurred 
what was its amount — whether exactly a degree in a 
century or more or less and how much and thus the 
determination of the magnitude completed the discoyery 
of the law of phenomena respecting this star 

 steps similar to these three may be discerned in 
all other discoveries of laws of nature thus in investi 
gating the laws of the motions of the sun moon or 
planets we find that these motions may be resolved 
besides a uniform motion into a series of partial motions 
or inequalities and for each of these inequalities we 
have to learn upon what it directly depends whether 

 hit ind set

analysis of the process of induction 

upon the progress of time only or upon some configura 
tion of the heavenly bodies in space then we have to 
ascertain its law and finally we have to determine what 
is its amount in the case of such inequalities the 
fundamental element on which the inequality depends is 
called the argument and when the inequality has been 
fiilly reduced to known rules and expressed in the form 
of a table the argument is the fundamental series of 
numbers which stands in the margin of the table and by 
means of which we refer to the other numbers which 
express the inequality thus in order to obtain from a 
solar table the inequality of the suns annual motion 
the argument is the number which expresses the day of 
the year the inequalities for each day being in the 
table ranged in a line corresponding to the days more 
over the argument of an inequality being assumed to 
be known we must in order to calculate the table that 
is in order to exhibit the law of nature know also the 
law of the inequality and its amount and the inves 
tigation of these three things the argument the law 
and the amount of the inequality represents the three 
steps above described the selection of the idea the con 
struction of the conception and the determination of 
the magnitude 

 in a great body of cases mathematical language and 
calculation are used to express the connexion between 
the general law and the special fects and when this is 
done the three steps above described may be spoken of 
as the selection of the independent variahley the con 
struction of the foimula and the determination of the 
coefficients it may be worth our while to attend to an 
exemplification of this suppose then that in such 
observations as we have just spoken of namely the shift 
ing of a star from its place in the heavens by an unknown 
law astronomers had at the end of three successive years 
vol ii m

found that the star had removed by by and by 
minutes from its original place suppose it to be ascer 
tained also by methods of which we shall hereafter treat 
that this change depends upon the time we must theii 
take the time which we may denote by the symbol for 
the independent variable but though the star changes its 
place with the time the change is not proportional to 
the time for its motion which is only minutes in the 
first year is minutes in the second year and in the 
third but it is not difficult for a person a little versed 
in mathematics to perceive that the series may 
be obtained by means of two terms one of which is pro 
portional to the time and the other to the square of the 
time that is it is expressed by the forfnula at bit 
the question then occurs what are the values of the 
coefficienis a and b and a little examination of the case 
shows us that a must be and b so that the formuk 
is t tt indeed if we add together the series 
which expresses the change proportional to the time and 
 which is proportional to the square of the time 
we obtdn the series which is the series of num 
bers given by observation and thus the three st 
which give us the idea the conception and the magni 
tudes or the argument the law and the amount of 
the change give us the independent variable the for 
mula and the coefficients respectively 

we now proceed to offer some suggestions of methods 
by which each of these steps may be in some degree 
promoted 

sect il of the selection of fundamental idea 

 when we turn our thoughts upon any asseinmage 
of facts with a view of collecting from theni some con 
nexion or law the most important step and at the same 
time that in which rules can least aid us is the selection 
of the idea by which they are to be collected so long 



digitized by vjooq ic 



analysis op the pfiocess of induotion 

as this idea has not been detected all seems to be hope 
less confusion or insulated facts when the connecting 
idea has been caught sight of we constantly regard the 
facts with reference to their connexion and wonder that 
it should be possible for auj one to consider them in anj 
other point of view 

thus the different seasons and the yarious aspects of 
the heavenly bodies might at first appear to be direct 
manifestations from some superior power which man 
could not even understand but it was soon found that 
the ideas of time and space of motion and recurrence 
would give coherency to many of the phenomena yet 
this took place by successive steps eclipses for a long 
period seemed to follow no law and being very remark 
able events continued to be deemed the indications of a 
supernatural will after the common motions of the 
heavens were seen to be governed by relations of time 
and space at length however the chaldeans discovered 
that after a period of eighteen years similar sets of 
eclipses recur and thus selecting the idea of time simply 
as that to which these events were to be referred they 
were able to reduce them to rule and from that time 
eclipses were recognized as parts of a regular order of 
things we may in the same manner consider any other 
course of events and may inquire by what idea they are 
bound together for example if we take the weather 
years peculiarly wet or dry hot and cold productive and 
unproductive follow each other in a manner which at 
first sight at least seems utterly lawless and irregular 
now can we in any way discover some rule and order in 
these occurrence is there for example in these events 
as in eclipses a certain cycle of years after vrtilch like 
seasons come round again or does the weather depend 
upon the force of some extraneous body— for instanee

would the most proper way of investigating this subject 
be to consider the effect of the moisture and heat of 
various tracts of the earths surface upon the ambient air 
it is at our choice to try these and other modes of obtain 
ing a science of the weather that is we may refer the 
phenomena to the idea of time introducing the conception 
of a cycle — or to the idea of external fofice by the con 
ception of the moons action — or to the idea of mutual 
aetion introducing the conceptions of thermotical and 
atmological agencies operating between different regions 
of earth water and air 

 it may be asked how are we to decide in such 
alternatives how are we to select the one right idea 
out of several conceivable ones to which we can only 
reply that this must be done by tfytny which will succeed 
if there really exist a cycle of the weather as well as of 
eclipses it must be established by comparing the asserted 
cycle with a good register of the seasons of sufficient 
extent or if the moon really influence the meteoro 
logical conditions of the air the asserted influence must 
be compared with the observed facts and so accepted or 
rejected when hipparchus had observed the increase 
of longitude of the stars the idea of a motion of the 
celestial sphere suggested itself as the explanation of the 
change but this thought was verified only by observing 
several stars it was conceivable that each star should 
have an independent motion governed by time only or 
by other circumstances instead of being regulated by its 
place in the sphere and this possibility could be rejected 
by trial alone in like manner the original opinion of the 
composition of bodies supposed the compounds to derive 
their properties from the elements according to the law 
of likeness but this opinion was overturned by a thousand 
facts and thus the really applicable idea of chemical com 
position was introduced in modern times lu what has 



digitized by vjooq ic 



analysis of the process of induction 

already been said on the history of ideas we have seen 
how each science was in a state of confusion and darkness 
till the right idea was introduced 

 no general method of evolving such ideas can be 
given such events appear to result from a peculiar 
sagacity and felicity of mind — never without labour 
never without preparation — yet with no constant depend 
ence upon preparation or upon labour or even entirely 
upon personal endowments newton explained the 
colours which refraction produces by referring each 
colour to a peculiar angle of refraction thus introducing 
the right idea but when the same philosopher tried to 
explain the colours produced by diffraction he erred by 
attempting to apply the same idea the cowrse of a single 
ray instead of applying the truer idea of the interference 
of two rays newton gave a wrong rule for the double 
refraction of iceland spar by making the refraction 
depend on the edges of tlie rhombohedron huyghens 
more happy introduced the idea of the axis of symmetry 
of the solid and thus was able to give the true law of the 
phenomena 

 although the selected idea is proved to be the 
right one only when the true law of nature is established 
by means of it yet it often happens that there prevails 
a settled conviction respecting the relation which must 
afford the key to the phenomena before the selection has 
been confirmed by the laws to which it leads even 
before the empirical laws of the tides were made out it 
was not doubtful that these laws depended upon the 
places and motions of the sun and moon we know that 
the crystalline form of a body must depend upon its che 
mical composition though we are as yet unable to assign 
the law of this dependence 

 indeed in most cases of great discoveries the right 
idea to which the facts were to be referred was selected 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation oy science 

by many philosophers before the decisive demonstration 
that it toas the right idea was given by the discoverer 
thus newton showed that the motions of the planets 
might be explained by means of a central force in the 
sun but though he established he did not first select 
the idea involved in the conception of a central force 
the idea had already been sufficiently pointed out dimly 
by kepler more clearly by borelli huyghens wren 
and hooke indeed this anticipation of the true idea is 
always a principal part of that which in the history of 
the sciences we have termed the prelude of a discovery 
the two steps of proposing a philosophical problem and 
of sdlmng it are as we have elsewhere said both import 
ant and are often performed by different persons the 
former step is in fact the selection of the idea in 
explaining any change we have to discover first the argu 
tnentf and then the law of the change the selection of 
the argument is the step of which we here speak and 
is that in which inventiveness of mind and justness of 
thought are mainly shown 

 although as we have said we can give few precise 
directions for this cardinal process the selection of the 
idea in speculating on phenomena yet there is one role 
which may hve its use it is this — the idea and the 
facts must be homogeneous the elementary conceptions 
into which the facts have been decomposed must be of 
the same nature as the idea by which we attempt to 
collect them into laws thus if facts have been observed 
and measured by reference to space they must be bound 
together by the idea of space if we would obtain a 
knowledge of mechanical forces in the solar sjrstem we 
must observe mechanical phenomena kepler erred 
against this rule in his attempts at obtaining physical 
faiws of the system for the facts which he took were uie 
tdmli imt the changes of wiociuf which are reidly the

analysis of the process of induction 

mechanical facts again there has been a transgression 
of this rule committed by all chemical philosophers who 
have attempted to assign the relative position of the ele 
mentary particles of bodies in their component molecules 
for their purpose has been to discover the relations of the 
particles in space and yet they have neglected the only 
facts in the constitution of bodies which have a reference 
to space— namely cvystauine form and optical properties 
no progress can be made in the theory of the elementary 
structure of bodies without making these classes of facts 
the main basis of our speculations 

 the only other rule which i have to offer on this 
subject is that which i have already given — the idea 
must be tested by the facts it must be tried by applying 
to the facts the conceptions which are derived from the 
idea and not accepted till some of these succeed in giving 
the law of the phenomena the justice of the suggestion 
cannot be known otherwise than by making the trial 
if we can discover a true law by employing any concep 
tions the idea from which these conceptions are derived 
is the right one nor can there be any proof of its rlght 
ness so complete and satisfactory as that we are by it led 
to a solid and permanent truth 

this however can hardly be termed a rule for when 
we would know to conjecture and to try the truth of 
out conjecture by a comparison with the facts is the 
natural and obvious dictate of common sense 

supposing the idea which we adopt or which we 
would try to be now fixed upon we still have before us 
the range of many conceptions derived from it many 
formulae may be devised depending on the same inde 
pendent variable and we must now consider how our 
selctio anoong these is to be made

general rules for the construction of 
the conception 

 in speakiug of the discovery of laws of nature 
those which depend upon quantity as number space and 
the like are most prominent and most easily conceived 
and therefore in speakiug of such researches we shall 
often use language which applies peculiarly to the cases 
in which quantities numerically measurable are concerned 
leaving it for a subsequent task to extend our principles 
to ideas of other kinds 

hence we may at present consider the construction 
of a conception which shall include and connect the 
facts as being the construction of a mathematical for 
mula coinciding with the numerical expression of the 
facts and we have to consider how this process can be 
facilitated it being supposed that we have already before 
us the numerical measures given by observation 

 we may remark however that the construction 
of the right formula for any such case and the deter 
mination of the coefficients of such formula which we 
have spoken of as two separate steps are in practice 
almost necessarily simultaneous for the near coincidence 
of the results of the theoretical rule with the observed 
facts confirms at the same time the formula and its coeffi 
cients in this case also the mode of arriving at truth 
is to try various hypotheses — to modify the hypotheses so 
as to approximate to the facts and to multiply the facts 
 as to test the hypotheses 

the independent variable and the formula which 
we would try being once selected mathematicians have 
devised certain special and technical processes by which 
the value of the coefficients may be determined these

bules fob the construcmon of the conception 

we shall treat of in the next chapter but in the mean 
time we may note in a more general manner the mode 
in which in physical researches the proper formula may 
be obtained 

 a person somewhat versed in mathematics hajv 
ing before him a series of numbers will generally be able 
to devise a formula which approaches near to those 
numbers if for instance the series is constantly pro 
gressive he will be able to see whether it more nearly 
resembles an arithmetical or a geometrical progression 
for example mm dulong and petit in their investiga 
tion of the law of cooling of bodies obtained the following 
series of measures a thermometer was placed in an 
inclosure of which the temperature was degrees and 
the rapidity of cooling of the thermometer was noted for 
many temperatures it was found that 

for the temperature the rapidity of cooling was 
 „ 

 „ 

j „ 

 „ 

 „ 

and so on now this series of numbers manifestly in 
creases with greater rapidity as we proceed from the 
lower to the higher parts of the scale the numbers do 
not however form a geometrical series as we may easily 
ascertain but if we were to take the differences of the 
successive terms we should find them to be — 

 c 
and these numbers are very nearly the terms of a geome 
tric series for if we divide each term by the succeeding 
one we find these numbers 

 
in which there does not appear to be any constant ten 
dency to diminish or increase and we shall find that a 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the fobmation of scisncs 



geometrical series in which the ratio is may be 
made to approach very near to this series the deviations 
from it being only such as may be accounted for by con 
ceiving them as errors of observation in this manner 
a certain formula is obtained giving results which very 
nearly coincide with the observed facts as may be seen 
in the margin 

the physical law expressed by the formula just spoken 
of is this — that when a body is cooling in an empty 
inclosure at a constant temperature the quickness of the 
cooling for excesses of temperature in arithmetical pro 
gression increases as the terms of a geometrical progres 
sion diminished by a constant number 

 in the actual investigation of dulong and petit 
however the formula was not obtained in precisely the 
manner just described for the quickness of cooling 
depends upon two elements the temperature of the hot 
body and the temperature of the inclosure not merely 
upoji the eacess of one of these over the other and it 
was found most convenient first to make such experi 
ments as should exhibit the dependence of the velocity 
of cooling upon the temperature of the inclosure which 



 the fonnula is 


v — l where v is the velocity of 


cooling t the temperature of the thermometer expressed in degrees 


and a is the quantity

ruled for the construction of the conception 

dependence is contained in the following law — the 
quickness of cooling of a thermometer in vacuo for a 
constant excess of temperature increases in geometric 
progression when the temperature of the inclosure in 
creases in arithmetic progression from this law the 
preceding one follows by necessary consequence 

this example may serve to show the nature of the 
artifices which may be used for the construction of for 
mulce when we have a constantly progressive series of 
numbers to represent we must not only endeavour by 
trial to contrive a formula which will answer the con 
ditions but we must vary our experiments so as to 
determine first one factor or portion of the formula and 
then the other and we must use the most probable 
hypothesis as means of suggestion for our formulae 

 in a progressive series of numbers except the 
formula which we adopt be really that which expresses 
the law of nature the deviations of the formula from 
the fietcts will generally become enormous when the 
experiments are extended into new parts of the scale 
true formulae for a progressive series of results can hardly 
ever be obtained from a very limited range of experi 
ments just as the attempt to guess the general course 
of a road or a river by knowing two or three points of it 
in the neighbourhood of one another would generally 
fail in the investigation respecting the laws of the 
cooling of bodies just noticed one great advantage of 

 for if be the temperature of the inclosure and t the excess of 
temperature of the hot body it appears by this law that the radiation 

of heat is as a and hence the quickness of cooling which is as the 

excess of radiation is as — fl that is as a — l which 
agrees with the formula given in the last note 

the whole of this series of researches of dulong and petit is full of 
the most beautiful and instructiro artifices for the constntction of the 
proper formulas in physical research

 methods employed in the formation of science 

the course pursued by the experimenters was that their 
experiments included so great a range of temperatures 
the attempts to assign the law of elasticity of steam 
deduced from experiments made with moderate tempe 
ratures were found to be enormously wrong when very 
high temperatures were made the subject of experiment 
it is easy to see that this must be so an arithmetical 
and a geometrical series may nearly coincide for a few 
terms moderately near each other but if we take remote 
corresponding terms in the two series one of these will 
be very many times the other and hence from a narrow 
range of experiments we may infer one of these series when 
we ought to infer the other and thus obtain a law which 
is widely erroneous 

 in astronomy the serieses of observations which 
we have to study are for the most part not progressive 
but recurrent the numbers observed do not go on con 
stantly increasing but after increasing up to a certain 
amount they diminish then after a certain space increase 
again and so on changing constantly through certain 
cycles in cases in which the observed numbers are of 
this kind the formula which expresses them must be a 
circular function of some sort or other involving for in 
stance sines tangents and other forms of calculation 
which have recurring values when the angle on which 
they depend goes on constantly increasing the main 
business of formal astronomy consists in resolving the 
celestial phenomena into a series of terms of this kind in 
detecting their arguments and in determining their coeffi 
cients 

 in constructing the formulae by which laws of 
nature are expressed although the first object is to assign 
the law of the phenomena philosophers have in almost 
all cases not proceeded in a purely empirical manner to 
connect the observed numbers by some expression of

calculation but have been guided in the selection of their 
formula by some hypothesis respecting the mode of con 
nexion of the facts thus the formula of dulong and 
petit above given was suggested by the theory of ex 
changes the first attempts at the resolution of the 
heavenly motions into circular functions were clothed in 
the hypothesis of epicycles and this was almost inevi 
table we must confess says copernicus that the 
celestial motions are circular or compounded of several 
circles since their inequalities observe a fixed law and 
recur in value at certain intervals which could not be 
except they were circular for a circle alone can make 
that quantity which has occurred recur again in like 
manner the first publication of the law of the sinesy the 
true formula of optical refraction was accompanied by 
descartes with an hypothesis in which an explanation of 
the law was pretended in such cases the mere com 
parison of observations may long fail in suggesting the 
true formulae the fringes of shadows and other diffracted 
colours were studied in vain by newton grimaldi com 
paretti the elder herschel and mr brougham so long as 
these inquirers attempted merely to trace the laws of the 
facts as they appeared in themselves while young 
fresnel fraunhofer schwerdt and others detennined 
these laws in the most rigorous manner when they applied 
to the observations the hypothesis of interferences 

 but with all the aid that hypotheses and calcula 
tion can afford the construction of true formulae in those 
cardinal discoveries by which the progress of science has 
mainly been caused has been a matter of great labour 
and difficulty and of good fortune added to sagacity in 
the history of science we have seen how long and how 
hard kepler laboured before he converted the formula 
for the planetary motions from an epicyclical combination

to a simple ellipse the same philosopher labooriog 
with equal zeal and perserverance to disoover the formula 
of optical refraction which now appears to us so simple 
was utterly foiled malus sought in vain the formula 
determining the angle at which a transparent surface po 
larizes light sir d brewster with a happy sagacity di 
covered the formula to be simply this that the index of 
refraction is the tuigent of the angle of polarization 

though we cannot give rules which will be of much 
service when we have thus to divine the general form of 
the relation by which phenomena are connected there are 
certain methods by which in a narrower field our inves 
tigations may be materially promoted — certain special 
methods of obtaining laws from observations of these

special methods of induction applicable 
to quantity 

in cases where the phenomena admit of numerical 
measurement and expression certain mathematical me 
thods may be employed to facilitate and give accuracy to 
the determination of the formula by which the observa 
tions are connected into laws among the most usual 
and important of tiiese methods are the following — 
i the method of curves

 tlie method curves proceeds upon this basis 
that when one quantity undeigoes a series of changes 
 ffitindsciik

depending on the progress of another quantity a for 
instance the deviation of tb moon from her equable 
place depends upon the progress of time this depend 
enee may be expressed by means of a curve in the 
language of matheniticians the variable quantity whose 
changes we would insider is made the ardimue of th 
curve and the quantity on which the changes depend is 
made the abseissa in this manner the curve will exhibit 
in its form a series f undulations rising and felling so as 
to correspond with the alternate increase and diminution 
of the quantity represented at intervals of space which 
correspond to the intervals of time or other quantity by 
which the changes are regulated thus to take another 
example if we set up at equal intervals a series of ordi 
nates representing the height of all the successive high 
waters brought by the tides ata given place for a year 
the curve which connects the summits of all these ordi 
nates will exhibit a series of undulatitms ascending and 
descending once in about each fortnight since in that 
interval we have in succession the high spring tides and 
the low nip tides the curve thus drawn offers to the 
eye a picture of the order and magnitude of the dianges 
to which the quantity mder contemplation the height of 
high water is subject 

 now the peculiar facility and efficacy of the me 
thod of curves depends lipon this circumstance— hat 
order and regularity are more readily and clearly recog 
niaed when thus exhibited to the eye in a picture than 
they are when presented to the mind in any other manner 
to detect the relations of number considered directly as 
number is not easy and we might conteniplate for a 
long time a table of recorded numbers vrithout peroeiv 
ing the order of tbdr increase and diminution even if the 
law were moderately simple as any one may satisfy hiub 
self by looking at a tide table but if these numbers 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

are expressed by the magnitude of lines and if these lines 
are arranged in regular order the eye readily discovers the 
rule of their changes it follows the curve which runs 
along their extremities and takes note of the order in 
which its convexities and concavities succeed each other 
if any order be readily discoverable the separate obser 
vations are in this manner compared and generalized and 
reduced to rule by the eye alone and the eye so em 
ployed detects relations of order and succession with a 
peculiar celerity and evidence if for example we thus 
arrange as ordinates the prices of com in each year for a 
series of years we shall see the order rapidity and 
amount of the increase and decrease of price far more 
clearly than in any other manner and if there were any 
recurrence of increase and decrease at stated intervals of 
years we should in this manner perceive it the eye 
constantly active and busy and employed in making into 
shapes the hints and traces of form which it contemplates 
runs along the curve thus offered to it and as it travels 
backwards and forwards is ever on the watch to detect 
some resemblance or contrast between one part and 
another and these resemblances and contrasts when 
discovered are the images of laws of phenomena which 
are made manifest at once by this artifice although the 
mind could not easily catch the indications of their 
existence if they were not thus reflected to her in the 
clear mirror of space 

thus when we have a series of good observations and 
know tlie argument upon which their change of magni 
tude depends the method of curves enables us to ascer 
tain almost at a glance the law of the change and by 
further attention may be made to give us a formula with 
great accuracy the method enables us to perceive 
among our observations an order which vithout the 
method is concealed in obscurity and perplexity

special methods of induction quantity 

 but the method of curves not only enables us to 
obtain laws of nature from good observations but also in 
a great degree from observations which are very imperfect 
for the imperfection of observations may in part be cor 
rected by this consideration — that though they may 
appear irregular the correct fects which they imperfectly 
represent are really regular and the method of curves 
enables us to remedy this apparent irregularity at least 
in part for when observations thus imperfect are laid 
down as ordinates and their extremities connected by a 
line we obtain not a smooth and flowing curve such as we 
should have if the observations contained only the rigo 
rous results of regular laws but a broken and irregular 
line full of sudden and capricious twistings and bearing 
on its face marks of irregularities dependent not upon 
law but upon chance yet these irregular and abrupt 
deviations in the curve are in most cases but small in 
extent when compared with those bondings which denote 
the effects of regular law and this circumstance is one 
of the great grounds of advantage in the method of 
curves for when the observations thus laid down 
present to the eye such a broken and irregular line we 
can still see often whth great ease and certainty what 
twistings of the line are probably due to the irregular 
errors of observation and can at once reject these by 
drawing a more regular curve cutting off all such small 
and irregular sinuosities leaving some to the right and 
some to the left and then proceeding as if this regular 
curve and not the irregular one expressed the observa 
tions in this manner we suppose the errors of obser 
vation to balance each other some of our corrected 
measures being too great and others too small but with 
no great preponderance either way we draw our main 
regular curve not through the points given by our obser 
vations but among them drawing it as has been said by 
vol ii n 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

one of the philosophers who first systematically used 
this method with a bold but careful hand the regular 
curve which we thus obtain thus freed from the casual 
errors of observation is that in which we endeavour to 
discover the laws of change and succession 

 by this method thus getting rid at once iu a 
great measure of errors of observation we obtain data 
which are more true than the individual facts themselves 
the philosophers business is to compare his hypotheses 
with facts as we have often said but if we make the 
comparison with separate special facts we are liable to be 
perplexed or misled to an unknown amount by the 
errors of observation which may cause the hypothetical 
and the observed result to agree or to disagree when 
otherwise they would not do so if however we thus 
take the whole mass of the facts and remove the errors of 
actual observation by making the curve which expresses 
the supposed observation regular and smooth we have 
the separate facts corrected by their general tendency 
we are put in possession as we have said of something 
more true than any fact by itself is 

one of the most admirable examples of the use of 
this method of curves is found in sir john herschers 
investigation of the orbits of doime starsx the author 
there shows how far inferior the direct observations of the 
angle of position are to the observations corrected by a 
curve in the manner above stated this curve once 
drawn he says must represent it is evident the law 
of variation of the angle of position with the time not 
tnly for instants intermediate between the dates of obser 
vations but even at the moments of observation theio 
selves much better than the individual raw observations 
can possibly on an average do it is only requisite to

try a caise or two to be satisfied that bj substituting the 
curve for the points we have made a nearer approach to 
nature and in a great measure eliminated errors of obser 
vation in following the graphical process he addfi 
we have a conviction almost approaching to moral 
certainty that we cannot be greatly misled again 
having thus corrected the raw observations he makes 
another use of the graphical method by trying whether 
an ellipse can be drawn if not throuffky at least among 
the points so as to approach tolerably near them all and 
thus approaching to the orbit which is the subject of 
investigation 

 the obstacles which principally impede the appli 
cation of the method of curves are i our ignorance of 
the argument of the changes and ii the complication of 
several laws with one another 

i if we do not know on what quantity those changes 
depend which we are studying we may fail entirely in 
detecting the law of the changes although we throw the 
observations into curves for the true argument of the 
change should in feet be made the abscissa of the curve 
if we were to express by a series of ordinates the hour 
of high water on successive days we should not obtain 
or should obtain very imperfectly the law which these 
times follow for the real argument of this change is not 
the solar hour but the hour at which the moon passes the 
meridian but if we are supposed to be aware that this 
is the argument which theory suggests and trial instantly 
confirms we then do immediately obtain the primary 
rules of the time of high water by throwing a series of 
observations into a curve with the hour of the moons 
transit for the abscissa 

in like manner when we have obtained the first great 
or semimenstrual inequality of the tides if we endeavour 
to discover the laws of other inequalities by means of 

 n 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation op science 

turves we must take from theory the suggestion that the 
arguments of such inequalities will probably be the 
paralkue and the dedination of the moon this suggestion 
again is confirmed by trial but if we were supposed to 
be entirely ignorant of the dependence of the changes of 
the tide on the distance and declination of the moon the 
curves would exhibit unintelligible and seemingly capri 
cious changes for by the effect of the inequality arising 
from the parallax the convexities of the curves which 
belong to the spring tides are in some years made altera 
nately greater and less all the year through while in 
other years they are made all nearly equal this differ 
ence does not betray its origin till we refer it to the 
parallax and the same difficulty in proceeding would 
arise if we were ignorant that the moons declination is 
one of the arguments of tidal changes 

in like manner if we try to reduce to law any meteoro 
logical changes those of the height of the barometer for 
instance we find that we can make little progress in the 
investigation precisely because we do not know the 
argument on which these changes depend that there 
is a certain regular diurnal change of small amount we 
know but when we have abstracted this inequality of 
which the argument is the time of day we find far 
greater changes left behind from day to day and from 
hour to hour and we express these in curves but we 
cannot reduce them to rule because we cannot discover 
on what numerical quantity they depend the assiduous 
study of barometrical observations thrown into curves 
may perhaps hereafter point out to us what are the rela 
tions of time and space by which these variations are 
determined but in the mean time this subject exem 
plifies to us our remark that the method of curves is of 
comparatively small use so long as we are in ignorance 
of the real arguments of the inequalities 



digitized by vjooq ic 



special methods of induction — quantity 

 ii in the next place i remark that a difficulty 
is thrown in the way of the method of curves by the com 
bination of several laws one with another it will readily 
be seen that such a cause will produce a complexity in 
the curves which exhibit the succession of facts if for 
example we take the case of the tides the height of high 
water increases and diminishes with the approach of the 
sun to and its recess from the syzygies of the moon 
again this height increases and diminishes as the moons 
pamllax increases and diminishes and again the height 
diminishes when the declination increases and vice versa 
and all these arguments of change the distance from 
syzygy the parallax the declination complete their 
circuit and return into themselves in different periods 
hence the curve which represents the height of high 
water has not any periodical interval in which it com 
pletes its changes and commences a new cycle the 
sinuosity which would arise from each inequality sepa 
rately considered interferes with disguises and conceals 
the others and when we first cast our eyes on the curve 
of observation it is very far from offering any obvious 
regularity in its form and it is to be observed that we 
have not yet enumerated au the elements of this com 
plexity for there are changes of the tide depending upon 
the parallax and declination of the sun as well as of the 
moon again besides these changes of which the argu 
ments are obvious there are others as those depending 
upon the barometer and the wind which follow no known 
regular law and which constantly affect and disturb the 
results produced by other laws 

in the tides and in like manner in the motions of the 
moon we have very eminent examples of the way in 
which the discovery of laws may be rendered difficult by 
the number of them which operate to affect the same 
quantity in such cases the inequalities are generally

picked out in succession nearly in the order of teir 
magnitudes in this way there were successively col 
lectedi from the study of the moons motions by a series 
of astronomers those inequalities hich we term the 
equation of the centre the ihection the variation and 
the annual equation these inequalities were not in 
flict obtained by the application of the method of curves 
but the method of curves might have been applied to 
such a case with great advantage the method has been 
applied with great industry and with remarkable success 
to the investigation of the laws of the tides and by the 
use of it a series of inequalities both of the times and 
of the heights of high water has been detected which 
explain all the main features of the observed facts 

sect ii the method of means 

 the method of curves as we have endeavoured 
to explain above frees us from the casual and extraneous 
irregularities which arise from the imperfection of obser 
vation and thus lays bare the results of the laws which 
really operate and enables us to proceed in search of 
those laws but the method of curves is not the only one 
which effects such a purpose the errots arising from 
detached observations may be got rid of and the addi 
tional accuracy which multiplied observations give may 
be obtained by operations upon the observed numbers 
without expressing them by spaces the process of 
curves assumes that the errors of observation balance 
each other — that the accidental excesses and defects are 
nearly equal in amount — that the true quantities which 
would have been observed if all accidental causes of 
irregularity were removed are obtained exactly or nearly 
by selecting quantities upon the whole equally distant 
fvom the extremes of great and small which our imperfect 
observations oflfer to us but when among a number of 
unequal quantities we take a quantity equally distant from 



digitized by vjooq ic 



special mfthods of induction — quanttty 

the greater and the smaller this quantity is termed the 
mean of the unequal quantities hence the correction of 
onr obsenrations by the method of curves consists in taking 
the mean of the observations 

 now without employing curves we may proceed 
arithmetically to take the mean of all the observed 
numbers of each class thus if we wished to know the 
height of the spring tide at a given place and if we found 
that four different spring tides were measured as being of 
the height of ten thirteen eleven and fourteen feet we 
should conclude that the true height of the tide was 
the mean of these numbers — namely twelve feet and 
we should suppose that the deviation from this height 
in the individual cases arose from the accidents of 
weather the imperfections of observation or the oper 
ation of other laws besides the alternation of spring and 
neap tides 

this process of finding the mean of an assemblage of 
observed numbers is much practised in discovering and 
still more in confirming and correcting laws of pheno 
mena we shall notice a few of its peculiarities 

 it requires a knowledge of the argument of the 
changes which we would study for the numbers must 
be arranged in certain classes before we find the mean of 
each class and the principle on which this arrangement 
depends is the argument this knowledge of the argu 
ment is more indispensably necessary in the method of 
means than the method of curves for when curves are 
drawn the eye often spontaneously detects the law of re 
currence in their sinuosities but when we have collections 
of numbers we must divide them into classes by a selection 
of our own thus in order to discover the law which the 
heights of the tide follow in the progress from spring to 
neap we arrange the observed tides according to the 
day of the moons age and we then take the niean of all 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

those which thus happen at the same period of the moons 
revolution in this manner we obtain the law which we 
seek and the process is very nearly the same in all other 
applications of this method of means in all cases we 
begin by assuming the classes of measures which we 
wish to compare the law which we could confirm or 
correct the formula of which we would determine the 
coefficients 

 the argument being thus assumed the method 
of means is very efficacious in ridding our inquiry of 
errors and irregularities which would impede and perplex 
it irregularities which are altogether accidental or at 
least accidental with reference to some law which we 
have under consideration compensate each other in a 
very remarkable way when we take the means of many 
observations if we have before us a collection of ob 
served tides some of them may be elevated some 
depressed by the wind some noted too high and some 
too low by the observer some augmented and some dimi 
nished by uncontemplated changes in the moons distance 
or motion but in the course of a year or two at the 
longest all these causes of irregularity balance each 
other and the law of succession which runs through the 
observations comes out as precisely as if those disturbing 
influences did not exist in any particular case there 
appears to be no possible reason why the deviation should 
be in one way or of one moderate amount rather than 
another but taking the mass of observations together 
the deviations in opposite ways will be of equal amount 
with a degree of exactness very striking this is found 
to be the case in all inquiries where we have to deal with 
observed numbers upon a large scale in the progress of 
the population of a country for instance what can appear 
more inconstant in detail than the causes which produce 
births and deaths yet in each country and even in each 



digitized by vjooq ic 



spficul methods op induction— quantity 

province of a country the proportions of the whole num 
bers of births and deaths remain nearly constant what 
can be more seemingly beyond the reach of rule than the 
occasions which produce letters that cannot find their 
destination yet it appears that the number of dead 
letters is nearly the same from year to year and 
the same is the result when the deviations arise not 
from mere accident but from laws perfectly regular 
though not contemplated in our investigation thus 
the effects of the moons parallax upon the tides some 
times operating one way and sometimes another accord 
ing to certain rules are quite eliminated by taking the 
means of a long series of observations the excesses and 
defects neutralizing each other so far as concerns the 
effect upon any law of the tides which we would investi 
gate 

 in order to obtain very great accuracy very large 
masses of observations are often employed by philoso 
phers and the accuracy of the result increases with the 
multitude of observations the immense collections of 
astronomical observations which have in this manner 
been employed in order to form and correct the tables of 
the celestial motions are perhaps the most signal instances 
of the attempts to obtain accuracy by this accumulation 
of observations delambres tables of the sun are 
founded upon nearly observations bttrgs tables 
of the moon upon above 

but there are other instances hardly less remarkable

large number was necessary to remove the effects of

accidental causes and the attempts to discoyer the 
laws of change in the barometer have led to the perform 
ance of labours of equal amount laplace and bonvard 
examined this question by means of observations made 
at the observatory of paris four times every day for 
eight years 

 we may remark one striking evidence of the 
accuracy thus obtained by emplojring large masses of obser 
vations in this wqj we may often detect inequalities 
much smaller than the errors by which they are encumbered 
and concealed thus the diurnal oscillations of the bfux 
meter were discovered by the comparison of observations 
of many days classified according to the hours of the 
day and the result was a clear and incontestable proof 
of the existence of such oscillations although the dif 
ferences which these oscillations produce at different 
hours of the day are far smaller than the casual changes 
hitherto reduced to no law which go on from hour to 
hour and from day to day the effect of law operating 
incessantly and steadily makes itself more and more felt 
as we give it a longer range while the eflfect of acci 
dent followed out in the same manner is to annihilate 
itself and to disappear altogether from the result 

sect iii the method of least squares 

 the method of least squares is in fact a method 
of means but with some peculiar characters its object 
is to determine the best mean of a number of observed 
quantities or the most probable law derived from a number 

 this period of nineteen years was also selected for a reason which 
is alluded to in a former note p it was thought that this 
period secured the inquirer from the errors which might he prodnced 
by the partial coincidence of the arguments of different irregularities 
for example those due to the moons parallax and to the moons decli 
nation it has since been found phil tr on the detenmna 
turn of the law of the tides from short series of obeertkuums that with 
regard to parallax at least the means of one year give suffioient accuracy 



digitized by vjooq ic 



special methods op induction — quantity 

of observations of which some or all are allowed to be 
more or less imperfect and the method proceeds upon 
this supposition that all errors are not eqiudb probable 
but that small errors are more probable than large ones 
by reasoning mathematically upon this ground we find 
that the best result is obtained since we cannot obtain a 
result in which the errors vanish by making not the 
errors themselves but the sum of their squares of the 
smallest possible amount 

 an example may illustrate this let a quantity 
which is known to increase uniformly as the distance of 
a star from the meridian at successive instants be mea 
sured at equal intervals of time and he found to be suc 
cessively it is plain upon the face of these 
observations that they are erroneous for they ought to 
form an arithmetical progression but they deviate vridely 
from such a progression but the question then occurs 
what arithmetical progression do they most probably repre 
sent for we may assume several arithmetical progressions 
which more or less approach the observed series as for 
instance these three 
now in order to see the claims of each of these to the 
truth we may tabulate them thus

great aid to the calculator in his inferences from facts and 
removes much that is arbitrary in the method of means 

sect iv the method of residues 

 by either of the preceding methods we obtain 
from observed facts such laws as readily offer themselves 
and by the laws thus discovered the most prominent 
changes of the observed quantities are accounted for 
but in many cases we have as we have noticed already 
several laws of nature operating at the same time and 
combining their influences to modify those quantities 
which are the subjects of observation in these cases we 
may by successive applications of the methods already 
pointed out detect such laws one after another but this 
successive process though only a repetition of what we 
have already described offers some peculiar features which 
make it convenient to consider it in a separate section 
as the method of residues 

 when we have in a series of changes of a variable 
quantity discovered one law which the changes follow 
detected its argument and determined its magnitude so 
as to explain most clearly the course of observed facts 
we may still find that the observed changes are not fully 
accounted for when we compare the results of our 
law with the observations there may be a difference or 
as we may term it a residue still unexplained but 
this residue being thus detached from the rest may be 
examined and scrutinized in the same manner as the 
whole observed quantity was treated at first and we may 
in this way detect in it also a law of change if we can 
do this we must accommodate this new found law as 
nearly as possible to the residue to which it belongs and 
this being done the difference of our rule and of the 
residue itself forms a second residue this second re 
sidue we may again bring under our consideration and 
may perhaps in it also discover some law of change by 



digitized by vjooq ic 



special methods op induction quantity 

which its alterations may be in some measure accounted 
for if this can be done so as to account for a large 
portion of this residue the remaining unexplained part 
forms a third residtie and so on 

 this course has really been followed in various 
inquiries especially in those of astronomy and tidology 
the equation of the centre for the moon was obtained 
out of the residue of the longitude which remained 
when the mean anomaly was taken away this equa 
tion being applied and disposed of the second residue 
thus obtained gave to ptolemy the ejection the third 
residue left by the equation of the centre and the evec 
tion supplied to tycho the variation and the annuul 
equation and the residue remaining from these 
has been exhausted by other equations of various argu 
ments suggested by theory or by observation in 
this case the successive generations of astronomers 
have gone on each in its turn executing some step in 
this method of residues in the examination of the 
tides on the other hand this method has been applied 
systematically and at once the observations readily 
gave the semimenstrual inequality the residue of this 
supplied the corrections due to the moons parajlaw and 
declination and when these were determined the r 
maining residue was explored for the law of the solar 
correction 

 in a certain degree the method of residues and 
the method of means are opposite to each other for 
the method of residues extricates laws from their com 
bination bringing them into view in succession while the 
method of means discovers each law not by bringing 
the others into view but by destroying their effect through 
an accumulation of observations by the method of re 
sidues we should first extract the law of the parallax 
correction of the tides and then from the residue left 
by this obtain the declination correction but we 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

might at once employ the method of means and put 
together all the cases in which the declination was the 
same not allowing for the parallax in each case but 
taking for granted that the parallaxes belonging to the 
same declination would neutralize each other as many 
falling above as below the mean parallax in cases like 
this where the method of means is not impeded by a 
partial coincidence of the arguments of different unknown 
inequalities it may be employed with almost as much 
success as the method of residues but still when the 
arguments of the laws are clearly known as in this 
instance the method of residues is more clear and direct 
and is the rather to be recommended 

 if for example we wish to learn whether the 
height of the barometer exerts any sensible influence on 
the height of the seas surce it would appear that the 
most satisfactory mode of proceeding must be to subtract 
in the first place what we know to be the effects of the 
moons age parallax and declination and other ascer 
tained causes of change and to search in the unexplained 
residue for the effects of barometrical pressure the con 
trary course has however been adopted and the effect of 
the barometer on the ocean has been investigated by the 
direct application of the method of means classing the 
observed heights of the water according to the corres 
ponding heights of the barometer without any previous 
reduction in this manner the suspicion that the tide of 
the sea is effected by the pressure of the atmosphere has 
been confirmed this investigation must be looked upon 
as a remarkable instance of the efficacy of the method 
of means since the amount of the barometrical effect is 
much smaller than the other changes from among which 
it was by this process extricated but an application of 
the method of residues would still be desirable on a 
subject of such extent and difficulty

process in some of these he has also considered this 
method in a wider sense than we have done treating it

relations of different kinds 

we likewise shall proceed to offer a few remarks on 
methods of induction applicable to other relations than 
those of quantity

methods op induction depending on 
resemblance 

sect i the law of conhnuuy 

 the law of continuity is applicable to quantity 
primarily and therefore might be associated with th 
methods treated of in the last chapter but inasmuch aj 
its inferences are made by a transition from one degree to 
another among contiguous cases it will be found to 
belong more properly to the methods of induction of 
which we have now to speak 

the law of continuiigf consists in this proposition— 
that a quantity cannot pass from one amount to another 
by any change of conditions without passing through all 
intermediate degrees of magnitude according to the inter 
mediate conditions and this law may often be employed 
to correct inaccurate inductions and to reject distinctions 
which have no real foundation in nature for example 
the aristotelians made a distinction between motions 
according to nature as that of a body falling vertically 
downwards and motions contrary to nature as that of a 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

body moving along a horizontal plane the former they 
held became naturally quicker and quicker the latter 
naturally slower and slower but to this it might be 
replied that a horizontal line may pass by gradual motion 
through various inclined positions to a vertical position 
and thus the retarded motion may pass into the accele 
rated and hence there must be some inclined plane on 
which the motion downwards is naturally uniform which 
is false and therefore the distinction of such kinds of 
motion is unfounded again the proof of the first law 
of motion depends upon the law of continuity for since 
by diminishing the resistance to a body moving on a 
horizontal plane we diminish the retardation and this 
without limit the law of continuity will bring us at the 
same time to the case of no resistance and to the case of 
no retardation 

 the law of continuity is asserted by galileo in a 
particular application and the assertion which it suggests 
is by him referred to plato — namely that a moveable 
body cannot pass from rest to a determinate degree of 
velocity without passing through all smaller degrees of 
velocity this law however was first asserted in a more 
general and abstract form by leibnitz f and was em 
ployed by him to show that the laws of motion propounded 
by descartes must be ialse the third cartesian law 
of motion was thisj that when one moving body meets 
another if the first body have a less momentum than the 
second it will be reflected with its whole motion but if 
the first have a greater momentum than the second it 
vnll lose a part of its motion which it will transfer to 
the second now each of these cases leads by the law 
of continuity to the case in which the two bodies have 
equal momentums but in this case by the first part of 

 iw iii iv f opera i 

j cartes prtn p 



digitized by vjooq ic 



methods of induction — resemblance 

the law the body would retain all its motion and by the 
second part of the law it would lose a portion of it hence 
the cartesian law is false 

 i shall take another example of the application of 
this law from professor plajrfairs dissertation on the 
history of mathematical and physical science the 
academy of sciences at paris having in proposed 
as a prize question the investigation of the laws of the 
communication of motion john bernoulli presented an 
essay on the subject very ingenious and profound in 
which however he denied the existence of hard bodies 
because in the collision of such bodies a finite change of 
motion must take place in an instant an event which on 
the principle just explained he maintained to be impos 
sible and this reasoning was justifiable for we can 
form a continuous transition from cases in which the 
impact manifestly occupies a finite time as when we 
strike a large soft body to cases in which it is apparently 
instantanedus maclaurin and others are disposed in 
order to avoid the conclusion of bernoulli to reject the 
law of continuity this however would not only be 
as playfair says to deprive ourselves of an auxiliary com 
monly useful though sometimes deceptive but what is 
much worse to acquiesce in false propositions from the 
want of clear and patient thinking for the law of 
continuity when rightly interpreted is never violated in 
actual fact there are not really any such bodies as have 
been termed perfectly hard and if we approach towards 
such cases we must learn the laws of motion which rule 
them by attending to the law of continuity not by 
rejecting it 

 newton used the law of continuity to suggest 
but not to prove the doctrine of universal gravitation 
let he said a terrestrial body be carried as high as the

moon will it not still fall to the earth and does not the 
moon fall by the same force again if any one says 
that there is a material ether which does not gravitatef 
this kind of matter by condensation may be gradnally 
transmuted to the density of the most intensely gravi 
tating bodies and these gravitating bodies by taking the 
internal texture of the condensed ether may cease to 
gravitate and thus the weight of bodies depends not 
on their quantity of matter but on their texture which 
doctrine newton conceived he had disproved by expe 
riment 

 the evidence of the law of continuity resides 
in the universality of those ideas which enter into our 
apprehension of laws of nature when of two quan 
tities one depends upon the other the law of continuity 
necessarily governs this dependence every philosopher 
has the power of applying this law in proportion as he has 
the faculty of apprehending the ideas which he employs 
in his induction vrith the same clearness and steadiness 
which belong to the fundamental ideas of quantity space 
and number to those who possess this faculty the law 
is a rule of very wide and decisive application its use as 
has appeared in the above examples is seen rather in the 
disproof of erroneous views and in the correction of fsedse 
propositions than in the invention of new truths it is a 
test of truth rather than an instrument of discovery 

methods however approaching very near to the law 
of continuity may be employed as positive means of ob 
taining new truths and these i shall now describe 

sect ii the method of gradation 

 to gather together the cases which resemble each 
other and to separate those which are essentially distinct 
has often been described as the main business of science 
and may in a certain loose and vague manner of speaking 
pass for a description of some of the leading procedures ia

methods of ikduction — reemblake 

the acquirement of knowledge the selection of instances 
which agree and of instances which differ in some pro 
minent point or property are important steps in the 
formation of science but when classes of things add 
properties have been established in virtue of such com 
parisons it may still be doubtful whether these classes are 
separated by distinctions of opposites or by differences of 
degree and to settle such questions the methtki of 
gradation is employed which consists in taking inter 
mediate stages of the properties in question so as to 
ascertain by experiment whether in the transition from 
one class to another we have td leiap over a manifest gap 
or to follow a continuous road 

 thus for instance one of the early divisions estab 
lished by electrical philosophers was that of electrics and 
conductors but this division faraday has overturned as 
an essential opposition he takes a gradation which 
carries him from conductors to nonconductors sul 
phur or lac he says are held to be nonconductors but 
are not rigorously so spermaceti is a bad conductor 
ice or water better than spermaceti metals so much 
better that they are put in a different class but even in 
metals the transit of the electricity is not instantaneous 
we have in them proof of a retardation of the electrlo 
current and what reason mr faraday asks why 
this retardation should not be of the same kind as that 
in spermaceti or in lac or sulphur but as in them 
retardation is insulation and insulation is induction f 
why should we refuse the same relation to the same 
exhibitions of force in the metals 

tlie process employed by the same sagacious philo 
sopher to show the identity of voltaic and franklinic 

 researches tb series art 

t these words refer to another proposition also established by the 
method of gradation 

 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

electricity is another example of the same kind ma 
chine franklinic electricity was made to exhibit the 
same phenomena as voltaic electricity by causing the 
discharge to pass through a bad conductor into a very 
extensive discharging train and thus it was clearly shown 
that franklinic electricity not so conducted differs from 
the other kinds only in being in a state of successive 
tension and explosion instead of a state of continued 
current 

again to show that the decomposition of bodies in 
the voltaic circuit was not due to the attraction of the 
polesf mr faraday devised a beautiful series of experi 
ments in which these supposed poles were made to 
assume all possible electrical conditions — in which the 
decomposition took place against air which according to 
common language is not a conductor nor is decomposed 
against the metallic poles which are excellent conduc 
tors but undecomposable and hence he infers that the 
decomposition cannot justly be considered as due to the 
attraction or attractive powers of the poles 

 the reader of the novum organon may perhaps in 
looking at such examples of the rule be reminded of 
some of bacons classes of instances as his instanhb 
absentice in proaimo and his insfantib migrantes but we 
may remark that instances classed and treated as bacon 
recommends in those parts of his work could hardly lead 
to scientific truth his processes are vitiated by his 
proposing to himself the fom or catise of the property 
before him as the object of his inquiry instead of being 
content to obtain in the first place the law of phenomena 
thus his example of a migrating instance is thus given 
 let the naiure inquired into be that of whiteness an 
instance migrating to the production of this property is 
glass first whole and then pulverized or plain water and 

 hii ind set iii t lb bmarches art 

t nov org lib ii aph

methods of induction— resemblance 

water agitated into a foam for glass and water are trans 
parent and not white but glass powder and foam are 
white and not transparent hence we must inquire 
what has happened to the glass or water in that migra 
tion for it is plain that the frm of whiteness is con 
veyed and induced by the crushing of the glass and 
shaking of the water 

 we may easily give examples from other subjects 
in which the method of gradation has been used to esta 
blish or to endeavour to establish very extensive propo 
sitions thus laplaces nebular hypothesis — that sys 
tems like our solar system are formed by gradual conden 
sation from diffused masses such as the nebulae among 
the stars — is founded by him upon an application of this 
method of gradation we see he conceives among 
these nebulae instances of all degrees of condensation 
from the most loosely diffused fluid to that separation 
and solidification of parts by which suns and satellites 
and planets are formed and thus we have before us 
instances of systems in all their stages as in a forest we 
see trees in every period of growth how far the exam 
ples in this case satisfy the demands of the method of 
gradation it remains for astronomers and philosophers to 
examine 

again this method was used with great success by 
maculloch and others to refute the opinion put in cur 
rency by the wemerian school of geologists that the 
rocks called trap rocks must be classed with those to 
which a sedimentary origin is ascribed for it was shown 
that a gradual transition might be traced from those 
examples in which trap rocks most resembled stratified 
rocks to the lavas which have been recently ejected from 
volcanoes and that it was impossible to assign a different 
origin to one portion and to the other of this kind of 
mineral masses and as the volcanic rocks were certainly 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of science 

not sedimentary it followed that the trap rocks were not 
of that nature 

again we have an attempt of a still larger kind 
made by mr lyell to apply this method of gradation so 
as to disprove all distinction between the causes by which 
geological phenomena have been produced atid the causes 
which are now acting at the earths surface he has 
collected a very remarkable series of changes which have 
taken place and are still taking place by the action of 
water volcanoes earthquakes and other terrestrial opera 
tions and he conceives he has shown in these a gradation 
which leads with no wide chasm or violent leap to the 
state of things of which geological researches have sup 
plied the evidence 

 of the value of this method in geological specu 
lations no doubt can be entertained yet it must still 
require a grave and profound consideration in so vast an 
application of the method as that attempted by mr lyell 
to determine what extent we may allow to the steps of 
our gradation and to decide how ikr the changes which 
have taken place in distant parts of the series may exceed 
those of which we have historical knowledge before they 
cease to be of the same kind those who dwelling in a 
city see from time to time one house built and another 
pulled down may say that such eansting causes operating 
through past time sufficiently explain the existing condi 
tion of the city yet we arrive at important political and 
historical truths by considering the origin of a city as an 
event of a different order firom those daily changes the 
causes which are now working to produce geological 
results may be supposed to have been at some former 
epoch so far exaggerated in their operation that the 
changes should be paroxysms not degrees — that they 
should violate not continue the gradual series and 
we have no kind of evidence whether the duration of our 



digitized by vjooq ic 



methods op inducrnon — resemblance 

historical times is sufficient to give us a just measure of 
the limits of such degrees — whether the terms which we 
have under our notice enable us to ascertain the average 
jate of progression 

 the result of such considerations seems to be 
this — that we may apply the method of gradation in 
the investigation of geological causes provided we leave 
the limits of the gradation undefined but then this 
is equivalent to the admission of the opposite hypothesis 
for a continuity of which the successive intervals are not 
limited is not distinguishable from discontinuity the 
geological sects of recent times have been distinguished 
as uniformitariam and catastropaists the method of 
gradation seems to prove the doctrine of the uniformi 
tarians but then at the same time that it does this it 
breaks down the distinction between them and the cata 
btrophists 

there are other exemplifications of the use of grada 
tions in science which well deserve notice but some of 
them are of a kind somewhat different and may be con 
sidered under a separate head 

sect iii the method of natural classification 

 the method of natural classification consists as 
we have seen in grouping together objects not according 
to any selected properties but according to their most 
important resemblances and in combining such grouping 
with the assignation of certain marks of the classes thus 
formed the examples of the successful application 
of this method are to be found in the classificatory 
sciences through their whole extent as for example 
in framing the genera of plants and animals the 
same method however may often be extended to 
other sciences thus the classification of crystalline 
fbrms according to their degree of symmetry which 
is really an important distinction as introduced by

 methods employed in the formation of science 

mohs and weiss was a great improvement upon hauys 
arbitrary division according to certain assumed primary 
forms sir david brevster was led to the same distinc 
tion of crystals by the study of their optical properties 
and the scientific value of the classification was thus 
strongly exhibited mr howards classification of clouds 
appears to be founded in their real nature since it enables 
him to express the laws of their changes and successions 
as we have elsewhere said the criterion of a true classifi 
cation is that it makes general propositions possible 
one of the most prominent examples of the beneficial 
influence of a right classification is to be seen in the 
impulse given to geology by the distinction of strata 
according to the organic fossils which they contain 
which ever since its general adoption has been a leading 
principle in the speculations of geologists 

 the mode in which in this and in other cases the 
method of natural classification directs the researches of 
the philosopher is this — his arrangement being adopted 
at least as an instrument of inquiry and trial he follows 
the course of the different members of the classification 
according to the guidance which nature herself offers 
not prescribing beforehand the marks of each part but 
distributing the facts according to the total resemblances 
or according to those resemblances which he finds to be 
most important thus in tracing the course of a series 
of strata from place to place we identify each stratum 
not by any single character but by all taken together — 
texture colour fossils position and any other circum 
stances which offer themselves and if by this means 
we come to ambiguous cases where different indications 
appear to point different ways we decide so as best to 
inreserve undamaged those general relations and truths 
which constitute the value of our system thus although 

 ffut ind b ill 



digitized by vjooq ic 



methods of induction —resemblance 

we consider the organic fossils in each stratum as its 
most important characteristic we are not prevented by 
the disappearance of some fossils or the addition of others 
or their total absence from identifying strata in distant 
countries if the position and other circumstances autho 
rize us to do so and by this method of classification 
the doctrine of gedogicd equivalents has been applied 
to a great part of europe 

 we may further observe that the same method 
of natural classification which thus enables us to identify 
strata in remote situations notwithstanding there may be 
great differences in their material and contents also for 
bids us to assume the identity of the series of rocks which 
occur in different countries when it has not been verified 
by such a continuous exploration of the component mem 
bers of the series it would be in the highest degree 
unphilosophical to apply the special names of the eng 
lish or german strata to the rocks of india or america 
or even of southern europe till it has appeared that in 
those countries the geological series of northern europe 
really exists in each separate country the divisions of 
the formations which compose the crust of the earth must 
be made out by applying the method of natural arrange 
ment to that particular cascy and not by arbitrarily extend 
ing to it the nomenclature belonging to another case it 
is only by such precautions that we can ever succeed in 
obtaining geological propositions at the same time true 
and comprehensive or can obtain any sound general views 
respecting the physical history of the earth 

 the method of natural classification which we thus 
recommend falls in with those mental habits which we 
formerly described as resulting from the study of natural 
history the method was then termed the method of 
type and was put in opposition to the method of defi 

niiion

the method of natural classification is directly op 
posed to the process in which we assume and apply anw 
trary definitions for in the former method we find our 
elasses in nature and do not make them by marks of our 
own imposition nor can any advantage to the progress 
ef knowledge be procured by laying down our characters 
when our arrangements are as yet quite loose and un 
formed nothing was gained by the attempts to define 
metals by their weight their hardness their ductility 
their colour for to all these marks as fast as they were 
proposed exceptions were found among bodies which 
still could not be excluded from the list of metals it 
was only when elementary substances were divided into 
natural chsses of which classes metals were one that a 
true view of their distinctive characters was obtuned 
definitions in the outset of our examination of nature 
are almost always not only useless but prejudicial 

 when we obtain a law of nature by indaction 
from phenomena it commonly happens as we have 
already seen that we introduce at the same time a pro 
position and a definition in this case the two are cor 
relative each giving a real value to the other in such 
cases also the definition as well as the proposition may 
become the basis of rigorous reasoning and may lead to 
a series of deductive truths we have examples of such 
definitions and propositions in the laws of motion and 
in many other cases 

 when we have established natural classes of 
objects we seek for characters of our classes and these 
characters may to a certain extent be called the ikfifd 
hans of our classes this is to be understood however 
only in a limited sense for these definitions are not 
absolute and permanent they are liable to be modified 
and superseded if we find a case which manifestly be 
longs to our natural class though violating our defini 
tion we do not shut out the case but alter our defini

tion thus when we have made it part of our definition 
of tlie rose family that they have alternate stipulate leaves 
we do not therefore exclude from the family the genus 
lowa which has stipulte in natural classifications 
our definitions are to be considered as temporary and 
provisional only when mr lyell established the dis 
tinctions of the tertiary strata which he termed eocene 
mwcmiey and pliocene he took a numerical criterion the 
proportion of recent species of shells contained in those 
strata as the basis of his division but now that those 
kinds of strata have become by their application to a 
great variety of cases a series of natural classes we must 
in our researches keep in view the natural connexion 
of the formations themselves in different places and 
must by no means allow ourselves to be governed by the 
numerical proportions which were originally contemplated 
or even by any amended numerical criterion equally arbi 
trary for however amended definitions in natural his 
tory are never immortal the etymologies of pliocene 
and miocene may hereafter come to have merely an his 
torical interest and such a state of things will be no 
more inconvenient provided the natural connexions of 
each class are retained than it is to call a rock oolite or 
porphyry when it has no roelike structure and no fiery 
spots 

the methods of induction which are treated of in 
this and the preceding chapter and which are specially 
applicable to causes governed by relations of quantity or 
of resemblance commonly lead us to law of plienomena 
only inductions founded upon other ideas those of 
substance and cause for example appear to conduct us 
somewhat further into a knowledge of the essential 
nature and real connexions of things but before we 
speak of these we shall say a few words respecting the 
way in which inductive propositions once obtained may 
be verified and carried into effect by their application

chapter ix 
of the application of inductive truths 

 by the application of inductive truths we here 
mean according to the arrangement given in page 
those steps which in the natural order of science follow 
the discovery of each truth these steps are the verificor 
hon of the discovery by additional experiments and rea 
sonings and its extension to new cases not contemplated 
by the original discoverer these processes occupy that 
period which in the history of each great discovery we 
have termed the seqtid of the epoch as the collection 
of facts and the elucidation of conceptions form its 
prelude 

 it is not necessary to dwell at length on the pro 
cesses of the verification of discoveries when the law of 
nature is once stated it is far easier to devise and execute 
experiments which prove it than it was to discern the 
evidence before the truth becomes one of the standard 
doctrines of the science to which it belongs and is veri 
fied by all who study or who teach the science experi 
mentally the leading doctrines of chemistry are con 
stantly exemplified by each chemist in his laboratory 
and an amount of verification is thus obtained of which 
books give no adequate conception in astronomy we 
have a still stronger example of the process of verifying 
discoveries ever since the science assumed a systematic 
form there have been observatories in which the conse 
quences of the theory were habitually compared with the 
results of observation and to facilitate this comparison 
tables of great extent have been calculated vrith immense 
labour from each theory showing the place which the 
theory assigned to the heavenly bodies at successive 
times and thus as it were challenging nature to deny 



digitized by vjooq ic 



application op inductive truths 

the truth of the discovery in this way as i have else 
where stated the continued prevalence of an error in the 
systematic parts of astronomy is impossible an error 
if it arise makes its way into the tables into the ephe 
meris into the observers nightly list or his sheet of re 
ductions the evidence of sense flies in its face in a thou 
sand observatories the discrepancy is traced to its source 
and soon disappears for ever 

 in these last expressions we suppose the theory 
not only to be tested but also to be corrected when it is 
found to be imperfect and this also is part of the busi 
ness of the observing astronomer from his accumulated 
observations he deduces more exact values than had pre 
viously been obtained of the coefficients of these ine 
qualities of which the argument is already known this 
he is enabled to do by the methods explained in the fifth 
chapter of this book the method of means and espe 
cially the method of least squares in other cases he 
finds by the method of residues some new inequality 
for if no change of the coeflscients will bring the tables 
and the observation to a coincidence he knows that a 
new term is wanting in his formula he obtains as far 
as he can the law of this unknown term and when its 
existence and its law have been fully established there 
remains the task of tracing it to its cause 

 the condition of the science of astronomy with 
regard to its security and prospect of progress is one of 
singular felicity it is a question well worth our con 
sideration as regarding the interests of science whether 
in other branches of knowledge also a continued and con 
nected system of observation and calculation imitating the 
system employed by astronomers might not be adopted 
but the discussion of this question would involve us in a 
digression too wide for the present occasion

 there is another mode of application of true theo 
ries after their discovery of which wo must also speak i 
mean the process of showing that foots not included in 
the original induction and apparently of a different kind 
are explained by reasonings founded upon the theory 
the history of physical astronomy is full of such events 
thus after bradley and wargentin had observed a cer 
tain cycle among the perturbations of jupiters satellites 
laplace explained this cycle by the doctrine of universal 
gravitation the long inequality of jupiter and saturn 
the diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic the acce 
leration of the moons mean motion were in like manner 
accounted for by laplace the coincidence of the nodes 
of the moons equator with those of her orbit was proved 
to result from mechanical principles by lagrange the 
motions of the recentlydiscovered planets and of comets 
shown by various mathematicians to be in exact accord 
ance with the theory are verifications and extensions still 
more obvious 

 in many of the cases just noticed the consistency 
between the theory and the consequences thus proved to 
result from it is so far from being evident that the most 
consummate command of all the powers and aids of ma 
thematical reasoning is needed to enable the philosopher 
to arrive at the result in consequence of this eifcum 
stance the labours just referred to of laplace lagrange 
and others have befen the object of very gieat and very 
just admirdtion moreover the necessary connexion of 
new facts at first deemed inexplicable with principles al 
ready known to be true — a connexion utterly invisible at 
the outset and yet at last established with the certainty 
of demonstration — strikes us with the delight of a new 
discovery and at first sight appears no less admirable 
than an original induction accordingly men sometimes 

 hist ind scl ii

application of inductivb truths 

appear tempted to consider laplace and other great 
inatheniaticians as persons of a kindred genius to newton 
we must not forget however that therd is a great and 
essential difference between inductive and deductive pro 
cesses of the mind the discovery of a new theory 
which is true is a step widely distinct from any mere 
development of the consequences of a theory already 
invented and established 

 as an example in another field of the extension 
of a discovery by applying it to the explanation of new 
phenomena we may adduce wellss inquiry into the cause 
qf dew for this investigation although it has some 
times been praised as an original discovery was in fact 
only resolving the phenomenon into principles already 
discovered the atmologists of the last century were 
aware that the vapour which exists in air in an invisible 
state may be condensed into water by cold and they had 
noticed that there is always a certain temperature lower 
than that of the atmosphere to which if we depress 
bodies water forms upon them in fine drops this tem 
perature is the limit of that which is necessary to consti 
tute vapour and is hence called the constituent temperature 
but these principles were not generally familiar in eng 
land till dr wells introduced them into his jessay on 
dew published in having indeed been in a great 
measure led to them by his own experiments and reason 
ings his explanation of dew — that it arises from the 
coldness of the bodies on which it settles — was established 
with great ingenuity and is a very elegant confirmation 
of the theory of constituent temperature 

 the example of all the best writers who have pre 
viously treated of the philosophy of sciences from bacon 
to herschel draws our attention to those instanced of the 
application of scientific truths which are subservient to

the uses of practical life to the support the preserva 
tion the pleasure of nmn it is well known in how 
large a degree the furtherance of these objects constituted 
the merit of the novum organon in the eyes of its author 
and the enthusiasm with which men regard these visible 
and tangible manifestations of the power and advantage 
which knowledge may bring has gone on increasing up to 
our own day such useful inventions as we here refer to 
must always be objects of great philosophical as well as 
practical interest and it might be well worth our while 
did our present limits allow to discuss the bearing of such 
inventions upon the formation and progress of science 
for the present it must suffice to observe that those 
practical inventions which are of most importance in the 
arts are rarely or never of any material consequice to 
science for they are either mere practical processes 
hich the artist practises but which the scientist can 
not account for or at most they depend upon some of 
the inferior generalizations of science for their reason 
and do not tend to confirm or illustrate the higher points 
at which theory has arrived these considerations must 
be our apology for not entering into this discussion at the 
present advanced stage of our undertaking as we have 
already said knowledge is power but its interest for us 
in the present work is not that it is power but that it is 
knowledge the effect which the application of science 
to general practical uses has in diffusing a knowledge of 
theoretical principles and thus in giving to mens minds 
an intellectual culture is indeed well worthy our attention 
but the consideration of this subject must be reserved 
for some future occasion 

we must now conclude our task by a few words on 
the subject of inductions involving ideas ulterior to those 
already considered

chapter x 
of the induction of causes 

 we formerly stated the objects of the researches 
of science to be laws of phenomena and causes and 
showed the propriety and the necessity of not resting in 
the former object but extending our inquiries to the 
latter also inductions in which phenomena are con 
nected by relations of space time number and resem 
blance belong to the former class and of the methods 
applicable to such inductions we have treated already 
in proceeding to inductions governed by any ulterior 
ideas we can no longer lay down any special methods 
by which our procedure may be directed a few general 
remarks are all that we shall offer 

the principal maxim in such cases of induction is 
the obvious one — that we must be careful to possess and 
to apply with perfect clearness and precision the funda 
mental idea on which the induction depends 

we may illustrate this in a few cases 

 induction of substance — the idea of substance f 
involves this axiom that the weight of the whole com 
pound must be equal to the weights of the separate 
elements whatever changes the composition or separation 
of the elements may have occasioned the application 
of this maxim we may term the method of the balance 
we have seen how the memorable revolution in chemis 
try the overthrow of phlogiston and the establishment of 
the oxygen theory was produced by the application of this 
method we have seen too that the same idea leads 
us to this maxim — that imponderable fluids are not to 
be admitted as chemical elements of bodies

whether those which have been termed imponderable 
fluids — the supposed fluids which produce the pheno 
mena of light heat electricity galvanism magnetism — 
really exist or no is a question not merely of the latosy 
but of the causes of phenomena it is as has already 
been shown a question which we cannot help discussing 
but which is at present involved in great obscurity nor 
does it pear at all likely that we shall obtain a true 
view of the cause of light heat and electricity till we 
have discovered precise and general laws connecting 
optical thermotical and electrical phenomena with those 
chemical doctrines to whih the idea of substance is 
necessarily applied 

 induction of force — the inference of mechaniod 
forces from phenomena has been so abundantly practised 
that it is perfectly familiar among scientific inquirers 
from the time of newton it has been the most common 
aim of mathematicians and a persuasion has grown np 
among them that mechanical forces attraction and re 
pulsion are the only modes of action of the particles of 
bodies which we shall ultimately have to consider i 
have attempted to show that this mode of conception is 
inadequate to the purposes of sound philosophy — that 
the particles of crystals and the elements of chemical 
compounds must be supposed to be comuned in some 
other way than by mere mechanical attraction and 
repulsion faraday has gone further in shaking the 
usual conceptions of the force exerted in wellknown 
cases among the most noted and conspicuous instances 
of attraction and repulsion exerted at a distance were 
thos which take place between electrized bodies but 
the eminent electrician just mentioned has endeavoured 
to establish by experiments of which it is very difficult 
to elude the weight that the action in these cases does 
not take place at a distance but is the result of a chain

induction of causb 

of intermediate particles connected at ereiy point hj 
forces of another kind 

 induction of polarifythe forcee to which mr 
faraday ascribes the action in these cases are polar 
forces we have already endeavoured to explain the 
idea of polar forces which implies f that at everjr point 
forces exactly equal act in opposite directions and thus 
in the greater part of their course neutralize and conceal 
each other while at the extremities of the line being by 
some cause liberated they are manifested still equal and 
opposite and the criterion by which this polar cha 
racter of forces is recognized is implied in the reasoning 
of faraday on the question of one or two electricities 
of which we formerly spoke the maxim is thisrthat 
in the action of polar forces along with every manifesta 
tion of force or property there exists a corresponding and 
simultaneous manifestation of an equal and opposite force 
or property 

 as it was the habit of the last age to reduce all 
action to mechanical forces the present race of physi 
cal speculators appears inclined to reduce all forces to 
polar forces mosotti has endeavoured to show that the 
positive and negative electoicities pervade all bodies and 
that gravity is only an apparent excess of one of the kinds 
over the other as we have seen faraday has given 
strong experimental grounds for believing that the sup 
posed remote actions of electrized bodies are really the 
effects of polar forces among contiguous particles if this 
doctrine were established with regard to all electrical 
magnetical and chemical forces we might ask whether 
while all other forces are polar gravity really affords a 
single exception to the universal rule is not the uni 
verse pervaded by an omnipresent antagonism a funda

mental conjunction of contraries everywhere opposite 
nowhere independent we are as yet far from the 
position in which inductive science can enable us to 
answer such inquiries 

 induction of ulterior causes — the first induction 
of a cause does not close the business of scientific 
inquiry behind proximate causes there are ulterior 
causes perhaps a succession of such gravity is the 
cause of the motions of the planets but what is the 
cause of gravity this is a question which has occupied 
mens minds from the time of newton to the present day 
earthquakes and volcanoes are the causes of many geolo 
gical phenomena but what is the cause of those subter 
raneous operations this inquiry after ulterior causes is 
an inevitable result from the intellectual constitution of 
man he discovers mechanical causes but he cannot 
rest in them he must needs ask whence it is that 
matter has its universal power of attracting matter he 
discovers polar forces but even if these be universal 
he still desires a further insight into the cause of this 
polarity he sees in organic structures convincing marks 
of adaptation to an end whence he asks is this adapta 
tion he traces in the history of the earth a chain of 
causes and effects operating through time but what he 
inquires is the power which holds the end of this chain 
thus we are referred back from step to step in 
the order of causation in the same manner as in the 
palsetiological sciences we were referred back in the 
order of time we make discovery after discovery in 
the various regions of science each it may be satisfac 
tory and in itself complete but none final something 
always remains undone the last question answered the 
answer suggests still another question the strain of 
music from the lyre of science flows on rich and sweet 
full and harmonious but never reaches a close no 



digitized by vjooq ic 



induction of causes 

cadence is heard with which the intellectual ear can feel 
satisfied 

of the supreme cause — in the utterance of science 
no cadence is heard with which the human mind can 
feel satisfied yet we cannot but go on listening 
for and expecting a satisfactory close the notion of a 
cadence appears to be essential to our relish of the music 
the idea of some closing strain seems to lurk among our 
own thoughts waiting to be articulated in the notes 
which flow from the knowledge of external nature the 
idea of something ultimate in our philosophical researches 
something in which the mind can acquiesce and which will 
leave us no further questions to ask of whence and iray 
and hy what power seems as if it belonged to us — as if 
we could not have it withheld from us by any imperfec 
tion or incompleteness in the actual performances of 
science what is the meaning of this conviction what 
is the reality thus anticipated whither does the deve 
lopment of this idea conduct us 

we have already seen that a difficulty of the same 
kind which arises in the contemplation of causes and 
effects considered as forming an historical series drives 
us to the assumption of a first cause as an axiom to 
which our idea of causation in time necessarily leads 
and as we were thus guided to a first cause in order of 
succession the same kind of necessity directs us to a 
supreme cause in order of causation 

on this most weighty subject it is difficult to speak 
fitly and the present is not the proper occasion even for 
most of that which may be said but there are one or 
two remarks which flow from the general train of the 
contemplations we have been engaged in and with which 
this work must conclude 

we have seen how different are the kinds of cause to 
which we are led by scientific researches mechaniil

 methods employed in the forbcation of science 

forces are insufficient without chemical ajflnuies che 
mical agencies feil us and we are compelled to hare 
recourse to vital powers vital powers cannot be merely 
physical and we must believe in something hyperphysical 
something of the natare of a sotd not only do biological 
inquiries lead us to assume an animal soul but they drive 
us much further they bring before us percqfftion and 
wiu evoked by perception still more these inquiries 
disclose to us ideas as the necessary forms of perception 
in the actions of which we ourselves are conscious we 
are aware we cannot help being aware of our ideas and 
our volitions as belonging to tisy and thus we pass 
from things to persons we have the idea of personalify 
awakened and the idea of design and purpose of 
which we are conscious in our ovra minds we find reflected 
back to us with a distinctness which we cannot overlook 
in all the armngements which constitute the frame of 
organized beings 

we cannot but reflect how widrfy diverse are the 
kinds of principles thus set before us — by what vast 
strides we mount from the lower to the higher as we 
proceed through that series of causes which the range 
of the sciences thus brings under our notice yet we 
know how narrow is the range of these sciences when 
compared with the whole extent of human knowledge 
we cannot doubt that on many other subjects besides 
those included in physical speculation man has made 
out solid and satisfactory trains of connexion •— as dis 
covered clear and indisputable evidee of causation it 
is manifest therefore that if we are to attempt to 
ascend to the supreme cause — if we are to try to frame 
an idea of the cause of all these subordinate causes 
we must conceive it as more different from any of them 
than the most diverse are from each other more elevated 
above the highest than the highest in above the lowtt 



digitized by vjooq ic 



induction of causes s 

but further — though the supreme cause must thus 
be inconceivably different from all subordinate causes 
and immeasurably elevated above them all it must still 
include in itself all that is essential to each of them by 
virtue of that very circumstance that it is the cause of 
their causality time and space — infinite time and 
infinite space — must be among its attributes for we 
cannot but conceive infinite time and space as attributed 
of the infinite cause of the universe force and 
matter must depend upon it for their efficacy for we 
cannot conceive the activity of force or the resistance of 
matter to be independent powers but these are its 
lower attributes the vital powers the animal soul 
which are the causes of the actions of living things are 
only the effects of the supreme cause of life and this 
cause even in the lowest forms of organized bodies and 
still more in those which stand higher in the scale in 
volves a reference to ends and purposes in short to mani 
fest final causes since this is so and since even when we 
contemplate ourselves in a view studiously narrowed we 
still find that we have ideas and will and personality 
it would render our philosophy utterly incoherent and 
inconsistent with itself to suppose that personality and 
ideas and will and purpose do not belong to the 
supreme cause from which we derive all that we have 
and all that we are 

but we may go a step farther — though in our pre 
sent field of speculation we confine ourselves to know 
ledge founded on the fitcts which the external world 
presents to us we cannot forget in speaking of such 
a theme as that to which we have thus been led that 
these are but a small and the least signtficant portion 
of the facts which bear upon it we cannot ftdl to 
recollect that there are facts belonging to the world 
ithin us which more readily and strongly direct our 



digitized by vjooq ic 



 methods employed in the formation of ciencb 

thoughts to the supreme cause of all things we can 
plainly discern that we have ideas elevated aboyo the 
region of mechanical causation of animal existence 
even of mere choice and will which still have a clear and 
definite significance a permanent and indestructible vali 
dity we perceive as a fact that we have a conscience 
judging of right and wrong that we have ideas of 
moral good and evil that we are compelled to conceive 
the organization of the moral world as well as of the vital 
frame to be directed to an end and governed by a purpose 
and since the supreme cause is the cause of these facts 
the origin of these ideas we cannot refuse to recognize 
him as not only the maker but the governor of the 
world as not only a creative but a providential power 
as not only a universal father but an ultimate judge 

we have already passed beyond the boundary of 
those speculations which we proposed to ourselves as 
the basis of our conclusions yet we may be allowed 
to add one other reflection if we find in ourselves 
ideas of good and evil manifestly bestowed upon us 
to be the guides of our conduct which guides we yet 
find it impossible consistently to obey — if we find 
ourselves directed even by our natural light to aim 
at a perfection of our moral nature from which we are 
constantly deviating through weakness and perverseness 
— if when we thus lapse and err we can find in the 
region of human philosophy no power which can efiace 
our aberrations or reconcile our actual with our ideal 
being or pve us any steady hope and trust with regard 
to our actions after we have thus discovered their incon 
gruity ynth their genuine standard — if we discern that 
this is our condition how can we fail to see that it is in 
the highest degree consistent with all the indications 
supplied by such a philosophy as that of which we have 
been attempting to lay the foundationss tha the supreme

cause through whom man exists as a moral being of vast 
capacities and infinite hopes should have himself pro 
vided a teaching for our ignorance a propitiation for our 
sin a support for our weakness a purification and sancti 
fication of our nature 

and thus in concluding our long survey of the 
grounds and structure of science and of the lessons which 
the study of it teaches us we find ourselves brought to a 
point of view in which we can cordially sympathize and 
more than sympathize with all the loftiest expressions of 
admiration and reverence and hope and trust which have 
been uttered by those who in former times have spoken 
of the elevated thoughts to which the contemplation of 
the nature and progress of human knowledge gives rise 
we can not only hold with galen and harvey and all 
the great physiologists that the organs of animals give 
evidence of a purpose — not only assert with cuvier that 
this conviction of a purpose can alone enable us to under 
stand every part of every living thing — not only say with 
newton that every true step made in philosophy brings 
us nearer to the first cause and is on that account 
highly to be valued — and that the business of natural 
philosophy is to deduce causes from effects till we come 
to the very first cause which certainly is not mechanical 
— but we can go much further and declare still with 
newton that this beautiful system could have its origin 
no other way than by the purpose and command of an 
intelligent and powerful being who governs all things 
not as the soul of the world but as the lord of the 
universe who is not only god but lord and governor 
when we have advanced so far there yet remains one 
step we may recollect the prayer of one the master in 
this school of the philosophy of science this also we 
humuy and earnestly beg — that human things may not 
prccbce such as are divine — neither that from the

tiiilocking of the gates of sense and the kindling of a 
greater natural light anything may arise of incredulity or 
intellectual night towards divine mysteries but rather 
that by our minds thoroughly purged and cleansed frona 
fancy and vanity and yet subject and perfectly given up 
to the divine oracles there may be given unto faith the 
things that are faiths when we are thus prepared for 
a higher teaching we may be ready to listen to a greater 
than bacon when he says to those who have sought their 
god in the material universe whom ye ignorantly 
worship him declare i unto you and when we recol 
lect how utterly inadequate all human language has been 
shown to be to express the nature of that supreme 
cause of the natural and rational and moral and 
spiritual world to which our philosophy points with 
trembling finger and shaded eyes we may receive with 
the less wonder but with the more reverence the decla 
ration which has been vouchsafed to us
