preface 


the following treatise aims at giving a connected 
and consistent view of the subject which it under 
takes to explain and of the relation in which the 
several parts of it stand to each other perhaps 
it will not be considered as departing from the 
proper selfrestraint which leaves the question 
of originality to be decided by others if the 
author ventures to say that this connected view 
differs as a whole and of course in some of its 
details from any theory hitherto promulgated 
saying this is indeed putting forth no claim 
except to the attention of the reader inasmuch 
as there can be no merit in any difference from 
former writers unless that difference is founded 
in truth 

the author designed at first to make the treatise 
almost wholly expository but the number of un 
settled questions on which he had to touch forced

him more extensively into criticism and controversy 
than he had originally contemplated entering in 
such a work it was especially impossible not to

is at variance with some of its fundamental prin

considerable length 

if in doing this he has on the one hand been 
obliged to differ very widely on certain points 
from several of the ablest logical writers of the 
day he has on the other found himself in ac

present ages

chapter i 

the intellectual operations which pass under 
the name op reasoning 

in scrutinizing our own minds several different 
operations are easily distinguishable and have ac 
cordingly received particular appellations when 
present objects are discerned through the senses 
the act is usually named perception when objects 
formerly perceived by us or facts formerly known 
to us are recalled the mental event is denominated 
recollection or mere conception when objects or 
facts occur to the mind in a different order or com 
bination from that in which they were actually 
perceived there is something more than conception 
and it has been termed imagination lastly when 
facts perceived determine the mind to the belief of 
facts which it does not perceive although here also 

b 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


conception is implied the operation is evidently as 
distinct from the former three operations as they 
are from each other 

this intellectual process may be illustrated by a 
few familiar instances 

i am walking i will suppose on the seashore 
and perceiving a quantity of seaweed lying on the 
beach while the water is at the moment a quarter 
of a mile from it i conclude that the tide has 
ebbed and left the weed where i perceive it lying 

i notice the print of a small foot on the sand 
and i feel pretty sure that it was made by a child 

i look upon the multitude of gay people walking 
along the beach and i am struck with the thought 
that sooner or later and at the latest in no very 
long period they must all die 

i observe the sun to be exactly on the meridian 
and i calculate that at a place where a friend of 
mine resides degrees in longitude to the west of 
my position it is just eleven o’clock 

in these several cases my mind is determined by 
the sight of present phenomena conjoined with 
knowledge previously acquired to believe some 
thing which i do not actually perceive through the 
organs of sense something past something future 
or something distant or in other words to be 
lieve that some event has happened will happen or 
is happening although beyond the sphere of my 
observation 

but the actual presence of any facts to the senses 


 


the theory of reasoning 


 


is not essential to the operation in question i 
may recollect or be told of a fact and thus knowing 
it from recollection or testimony i may form the 
same inferences from it as if i perceived it 

this determination of the mind to the belief of 
something beyond its actual perception or know 
ledge is obviously what is termed reasoning 

there is however another mental operation to 
be noted which consists not in our being led to 
believe or in our inferring from what we perceive 
and know something else neither perceived nor 
known but in our being led to discern some fact 
not directly manifest through the medium of some 
other fact or facts in which it is implied 

suppose somebody to assert that the opposite 
angles made by the intersection of two right lines 
are equal this at the first glance appears likely 
enough to be true but it is not intuitively per 
ceived it is not immediately 
manifest when however he 
proceeds to point out that the 
angles abd and abc are toge 
ther equal to two right angles 
and that the angles abd and 
d b e are also together equal to 
two right angles we discern d k 

that these two pairs of angles are equal to each 
other and when he further points out the circum 
stance of the angle abd being common to the two 
equal pairs we at once discern that the other angle 

b 



 


 


the theory of reasoning 


a b c of the first pair is equal to the other angle 
dbe of the second pair 

here we do not infer the existence or the hap 
pening of something past or future or absent but 
we are led to discern something not directly ob 
vious by an arrangement of propositions expressive 
of facts each of which implies its successor 

to describe it more particularly 

the complex fact or combination of facts ex 
pressed in the proposition “ the two pairs of angles 
are respectively equal to two right angles” implies 
or leads the mind to discern that they are mu 
tually equal and the fact that the pairs thus 
proved to be equal have one angle in common 
implies or leads the mind to discern that the 
remaining angle in the one is equal to the remain 
ing angle in the other thus if we regard the 
facts there is selfevident involution or implication 
and if we regard the mind of the reasoner there is 
intuitive discernment at every step of the process 

the operation just described is termed reason 
ing equally with the other but there is evidently 
an important difference between them to be de 
termined by facts to the belief of an unobserved 
event or object past present or future and to 
discern when two facts are presented to the mind 
that one is implied in the other are intellectual 
acts or operations plainly distinct if there were 
no other circumstance by which to discriminate 
them they would be broadly distinguished by this

that in the latter species of reasoning every step 
being discerned to be necessarily true the denial of 
the conclusion involves a contradiction while in 
the former species it does not the conviction in 
the one case and the discernment in the other 
have nevertheless this in common that the fact 
expressed in the conclusion is not in either case 
evident of itself but is arrived at through the 
medium of some other fact or facts 

of these two species of reasoning while the 
second has been uniformly termed demonstrative 
the first has sometimes been called moral and 
sometimes probable reasoning but on account of 
the ambiguity of these appellations as will be ex 
plained in the next chapter i shall venture to 
speak of it under the designation of contingent 
reasoning although objections may doubtless be 
brought against the epithet contingent so applied 
it appears to me on mature consideration to be 
less exceptionable and more convenient than any 
other 

the facts which determine the mind to the belief 
or lead it to the discernment of other facts not im 
mediately manifest are usually spoken of under 
the designation of evidence or proofs and when 
expressed in propositions preceding a conclusion 
under that of premises 

to reason is to go through proofs or evidence 
for or against any alleged fact frequently the 
fact alleged or expressed in the conclusion is placed 

b 


 



 the theory of reasoning 

before the mind first and the proof is adduced to 
substantiate it but it also frequently happens in 
the course of reflection that a fact or combination 
of facts leads the mind to the belief or to the dis 
cernment of a fact before unknown which is then 
seen in its logical place as the conclusion 


 


 


chap ii 

contingent seasoning 

the preceding chapter having shown that there 
are two distinct mental processes which pass under 
the name of reasoning i purpose next to inquire 
more closely into the nature of the first of these 
processes the principles on which it proceeds and 
the foundation of its cogency 


section i 

the nature and cogency of contingent reasoning 

let us examine any simple instance of the first 
species of reasoning the one already cited re 
specting the seaweed found on the beach may 
serve the purpose what takes place on such an 
occasion may be described as follows — 

having previously observed the tide in ebbing 
leave the seaweed high upon the beach as i see it 
at the present time the recollection of this fact 

d 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


causes me to believe that the phenomenon before 
me has had the same origin 

here the mind is obviously determined by pre 
sent appearances conjoined with what has been 
previously observed to believe in a past event 
which has not actually fallen under observation 

in the inference also given in the preceding 
chapter “ that the gay people walking on the beach 
will sooner or later all die” the mind is likewise 
determined by previous observation or knowledge 
to the belief of events concerning the objects before 
it which from the nature of the case being yet to 
happen cannot have been observed but there is 
this difference — in the first example a past event 
is inferred from other past facts in the second 
future events are inferred from past events 

it is scarcely necessary to point out again that 
in another illustration before adduced a contempo 
raneous event or fact beyond the sphere of the 
reasoner’s observation is inferred from what is 
taking place before his eyes with the assistance of 
previous knowledge 

in all these examples alike the mind is deter 
mined to the belief of an event or fact not witnessed 
or known or in other words it infers an event or 
fact which it has not the means of immediately 
observing 

for such inferences one condition is always ne 
cessary the reasoner must have been acquainted 


 



contingent reasoning 


 


with a similar case or similar cases we are deter 
mined to the belief of an unobserved fact by having 
observed or known a similar fact to have taken 
place in similar circumstances it is this resem 
blance in the cases which leads us to infer that 
unobserved events have happened are happening 
or will happen 

tn simple cases where the complete resemblance 
of objects or events is at once discerned a single 
previous instance frequently suffices for an infe 
rence but in complicated cases where there is 
similitude with some degree of diversity a collection 
and comparison of various instances is necessary to 
show that the diversity does not affect the essential 
circumstances on which the event depends and that 
the instance about which we are reasoning does not 
differ from the others in which the event has been 
observed more than they differ from each other 

thus to revert to the examples already adduced 
i may have observed the action of the tide on the 
seaweed only once yet when i see the weed lying 
as before described i instantly conclude that it has 
been left by the retreating waves 

in the same way when i draw the conclusion 
that a child has passed over the sand from the 
marks imprinted upon it all that is necessary for 
the inference is the previous observation of a single 
fact of a similar kind 

on the other hand when i conclude that my 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


fellowcreatures around me will sooner or later die 
my inference is from a large number of facts known 
to me in various ways some gathered from per 
sonal observation some collected from the history 
of the race and the whole expressible in the pro 
position that all men in every climate how different 
soever in constitution character and habits after 
living a certain limited period have died 

it is obvious that whether we can draw an in 
ference from a single fact or whether it is needful 
to have a collection of facts depends altogether on 
what is requisite for establishing a similarity in the 
influential circumstances of each case and does not 
affect the character of the reasoning which is still 
inferring or being determined by what we are 
cognisant of to believe something beyond what is 
observed or known 

in the examples of reasoning already cited the 
conclusions it is to be remarked are all relating to 
definite objects and may be called particular in 
ferences but there is another large and important 
class of conclusions from analogous premises which 
are general or universal 

the same facts which determine us to believe 
that a single individual or that the crowd we see 
on the beach will die determine us to believe that 
all human beings will die or to express it in still 
more general terms that all men are mortal that 
these inferences which are usually termed general 


 



contingent reasoning 


 


laws are precisely of the same nature and rest on 
the same evidence as particular inferences is ma 
nifest they both alike predicate the unknown 
from the known and differ only in the extensive 
ness of their subject 

from what may be conveniently termed the col 
lective fact that men have hitherto been fallible as 
far as observation has extended i may deduce the 
particular conclusion that an unknown and untried 
individual named peter is fallible and i may 
equally deduce the universal conclusion that all 
men are fallible 

in the latter case it is instructive to mark the 
superior range of the inference from the same pre 
mises the proposition that all men are fallible 
not only embodies actual knowledge but as 
serts an intellectual imperfection in human beings 
whose mental condition and endowments have 
never been ascertained it affirms not only that 
in all known or observed instances men have been 
found fallible but that all human beings who have 
existed in time past unknown and unobserved 
have laboured under the same defect that all men 
now living known or unknown are subject to it 
and that all who shall hereafter exist will also be 
similarly constituted 

in illustration of what has been said let us place 
side by side the universal law and the particular 
inference from the collective fact 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


collective fact 

ah men as far as observation has extended have been found 
fallible 


universal law particular inference 

therefore all men are fallible therefore the man peter is 
t e men of past times be fallible 
yond the reach of observa or 

tion as well as those ob the next generation of men 
served were fallible men of will be fauible 
the present time whether or 

observed or unobserved are socrates who lived more than 
fallible and all future men two thousand years ago was 
will be fallible fallible 

it is obvious that both these conclusions both 
the universal law and the particular inference are 
deduced from the same fact or collection of facts 
they are if i may so express it abreast or co 
ordinate one is not or needs not be logically sub 
sequent to the other or to vary the language 
both are probable inferences for which the real 
evidence is the same the mental process too is 
alike it does not consist in the mind’s discerning 
one thing to be implied in another but in its being 
determined by known facts to believe unknown 
ones 

much error and confusion it appears to me has 
arisen from not distinguishing between the collec 
tive fact which is simply a summary of the 
evidence and the general or universal law inferred

which goes beyond the evidence i cannot help 
thinking that dr thomas brown with all his 
acuteness has either not discerned the distinction 
or not always kept it clearly in view as for ex 
ample in the following passage which even if i am 
not correct in my interpretation of it will assist 
me to explain the point under consideration 

“ if by the term general law be meant” he says 
“ the agreement in some common circumstances of 
a number of events observed there can be no 
question that we proceed safely in framing it and 
that what we have already found in a number of 
events must be applicable to that number of events 
— “ but the only particulars to which in this case 
we can with perfect confidence apply a general law 
are the very particulars that have been before ob 
served by us” 

this might be taken as a good description of that 
which is necessary to constitute what i have termed 
the collective fact but it would be an incorrect 
description of what is usually meant by a general 
law unless we construe the phrase the very par 
ticulars to denote not the identical facts but ex 
actly similar facts 

it would however be taking an imperfect view 
of the subject to suppose that we reason only from 
such collective facts as may be denominated uni 
form

the theory of reasoning 


besides the cases i have already noticed where 
the similarity of the influential circumstances is 
maintained amidst a certain diversity in other 
respects there are innumerable cases of a compli 
cated and not altogether definite character in 
which a certain result has not always happened but 
has taken place in more instances than it has failed 
to take place and others in which a result has 
failed oftener than it has happened when a new 
instance of the first kind presents itself we infer 
the probability that the event will happen to be 
greater than the probability of its not happening 
when an instance of the second kind is before us 
we infer the probability of its happening to be less 
than the probability of the contrary which proba 
bility it is almost needless to observe admits of 
degrees according to the varying circumstances of 
each instance 

the nature of the reasoning in these cases is the 
same as in those where the facts are uniform and 
it is only in the degree of probability which is re 
cognized that the conclusions differ it is obvious 
that the want of uniformity in the result is owing 
to a want of uniformity in the presence of the 
influential circumstances although the subjects 
of the proposition which expresses the fact are 
comprised in a general term or description yet 
they are alike only in certain respects and some of 
them differ in points on which the result depends 
for example it is a general observation that man

kind follow the religion of their immediate ances 
tors but this although generally is not invariably 
the case men are compound beings of varying 
qualities and a few in almost every country in 
consequence of peculiar circumstances or intel 
lectual idiosyncrasies are found to depart from the 
hereditary creed whence if you happen to meet 
with a native of turkey or russia you cannot 
infer from his country alone that the former holds 
the mahometan faith nor the latter that of the 
greek church if your knowledge of this single 
circumstance is your only guide your correct 
inference will be that he is very probably of the 
same religion as the great majority of his fellow 
countrymen 

my explanation of the nature of contingent rea 
soning would be incomplete without adverting to 
one point connected with it which has not always 
been seen in its true light every act of reasoning 
as i shall have occasion to show at greater length 
hereafter proceeds upon or exemplifies some ge 
neral principle or in other words from every act 
of reasoning some general principle may be drawn 
or educed which may for shortness be called the 
principle of the reasoning 

 the term “ deduce ” being already appropriated to the 
operation of inferring conclusions from premises it may con 
tribute to precision where precision is much wanted to adopt 
the term “ educe’ to denote the process of forming or drawing 
out the general principle which according to common pliraseo 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


we have therefore to inquire what is the prin 
ciple of the species of reasoning now under con 
sideration and we shall find it to be as follows — 
what has been observed to take place in a similar 
case or in all similar cases has taken place is 
taking place or will take place in the case before 
us where actual observation is precluded or more 
briefly without reference to time similar events or 
phenomena take place in similar cases 

this will appear sufficiently manifest if we dwell 
for a moment on the conclusion before men 
tioned that all the persons walking on the beach 
must sooner or later die the reason as we 
have already seen which determines the mind to 
this conclusion is that all human beings formerly 
living have died before attaining a certain age 
briefly expressed the reasoning is — 

all human beings formerly living have died 
before attaining a certain age 

therefore these human beings will die before 
attaining that age 

and the general principle which is exemplified 
here is that similar events will take place in similar 
cases 

a principle of reasoning may hence be regarded 
as a generalised statement or description of what 
our inferences consist in or of what we do when 
we draw them it may be remarked too that a 

logy is involved in an argument or on which an argument 
proceeds 


 


 



contingent keasonxng 


 


general principle of this kind includes subordinate 
or less general principles as classes include genera 
and genera include species we might for instance 
from the last example educe the principle “ what 
has happened to all human beings formerly living 
will happen to all now living” moreover as the 
chief cases of similarity are those of causation the 
two main subordinate principles in contingent rea 
soning may be stated briefly to be “ like causes pro 
duce like effects and like effects proceed from like 
causes” 

the next important point for our investigation 
is how is the cogency of this kind of reasoning 
which is confessedly not demonstrative to be 
proved to which i answer that the cogency of 
no direct and simple process of reasoning can be the 
subject of proof the only question is does the 
reasoning when clearly expressed produce convic 
tion or in other words do the facts when pre 
sented clearly to the mind determine it to believe 
that which is expressed in what is called the con 
clusion if they do we have reached an ultimate 
fact or law or principle of our mental constitution 
beyond which it is impossible to go it may be laid 
down as a general law or expression of this fact 
that the human mind is determined to the belief of 
similar events in similar cases the argument 
already cited that the human beings whom we are 
now looking upon will die before reaching a certain 
age because all other human beings or rather all 

c 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


human beings formerly living as far as observation 
has extended have so died produces conviction at 
once and nothing can enhance or diminish its 
power it is deserving of especial remark that 
drawing out the general principle implied in the 
argument or educible from it is of no avail in 
strengthening its force although the contrary has 
been frequently assumed and even expressly as 
serted the cogency of the reasoning in the par 
ticular example is quite as manifest as that of the 
principle on which according to the common 
phrase it proceeds or which is involved in it the 
maxim that what has been observed invariably to 
happen in certain cases has happened and will 
happen in all precisely similar cases is only a 
generalisation of the reasoning which is exhibited 
in particular instances and has no proving power 
of its own 

it is this step taken by the mind or rather this 
determination of the mind by known facts to believe 
unknown ones which gave rise to hume’s cele 
brated speculations in his chapter entitled “ scep 
tical doubts” he was not satisfied to receive it as 
an ultimate principle beyond which we could not 
go but wanted an explanation of its origin in some 
other principle after remarking that from the 
fact of having been formerly nourished by eating 
bread it does not necessarily follow that we shall be 
nourished by eating other bread he proceeds “ at 
least it must be acknowledged that there is here a 
consequence drawn by the mind that there is a 


 



contingent reasoning 


 


certain step taken a process of thought and an in 
ference which wants to be explained these two 
propositions are far from being the same l l have 
found that such an object has always been attended 
with such an effect ’ and ‘ i foresee that other objects 
which are in appearance similar will be attended with 
similar effects i shall allow if you please that 
the one proposition may justly be inferred from the 
other i know in fact that it always is inferred 
but if you insist that the inference is made by a 
chain of reasoning i desire you to produce that 
reasoning the connexion between these proposi 
tions is not intuitive there is required a medium 
which may enable the mind to draw such an in 
ference if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and 
argument what that medium is i must confess 
passes my comprehension and it is incumbent on 
those to produce it who assert that it really exists 
and is the original of all our conclusions concerning 
matters of fact” 

in this passage there are three points to be 
especially remarked hume affirms st that such 
inferences as he describes are always drawn and 
justly drawn that the connexion between the 
inference and the proposition from which it is 
drawn is not intuitively perceived that the in 
ference wants explanation and while he himself 
asserts that a medium or chain of reasoning is 
required to enable us to draw the inference he 

 sceptical doubts part ii 
c 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


confesses that what that medium is passes his com 
prehension and he challenges others to produce it 
now in the first and second of these assertions he 
is perfectly correct and his view of the subject 
corresponds with what has been said in the previous 
part of the present chapter but in the third he 
requires an explanation which is needless and he 
challenges his imaginary adversaries to produce 
what is totally uncalled for and cannot possibly be 
given if as he says an inference is unavoidably 
and justly drawn no medium or chain of reasoning 
is needed to enable us to draw it drawing an in 
ference is reasoning and between the inference and 
the fact from which it is drawn nothing can in the 
nature of the case be interposed all that he says 
merely shows that there is a species of reasoning in 
which we unavoidably infer unknown facts from 
known facts and that this is a different species of 
reasoning from that in which we intuitively discern 
one fact to be necessarily implied in another 

reid dugald stewart and thomas brown do 
not follow hume in his demand for a medium but 
they unite with him in declaring that inferences 
of the kind in question are not drawn by reasoning 

if we construe this declaration literally it 
amounts in fact to saying that we do not reason by 
reasoning which may be true but it is at all 
events nugatory we cannot certainly be said 
with any propriety to do an act by the act itself 
but who would think of making the assertion 


 


contingent reasoning 


 


there are two different propositions relating 
to this point which may easily be confounded 
viz “ these inferences are not drawn by reason 
ing” and “ drawing these inferences is not reason 
ing” the former as i have just explained if 
taken literally is a trifling and worthless assertion 
which perhaps in fairness to these philosophers 
we ought not to attribute to them they probably 
meant that such inferences are not demonstrated 
and that there is no absurdity in supposing them 
to be false the universal test of demonstrative 
arguments 

with regard to the latter proposition viz 
that “ drawing these inferences is not reasoning” 
we are precluded from assuming this to have been 
their meaning for it avould be inconsistent with 
their own practice which is constantly to speak of 
the drawing of such inferences as reasoning hume 
in one place denominates it experimental reasoning 
dr reid usually terms it probable reasoning and 
one short passage selected from a number of 
others proves that by this phrase he intended to 
designate such inferences as are now in question 
“ in probable reasoning the connexion between 
the premises and the conclusion is not necessary 
nor do we perceive it to be impossible that the 
first should be true while the last is false”

obviously in point where he speaks of “ the prin 
ciple of my nature which leads me thus not only 
to reason from the past to the future but to reason 
from one thing to another which in its external 
marks bears a certain degree of resemblance to 
it” 

the words of dr brown in proof of a similar 
use of the term reasoning need not be cited in 
form the reader will find a passage in his lec 
tures perfectly explicit and appropriate where he 
speaks of the “ reasoning of infants” f 

it might be well perhaps if we had a generic 
name by which to distinguish contingent from de 
monstrative reasoning but since we are accus 
tomed to employ the same expressions in regard 
to both applying to them in common such terms 
as proofs premises consequences inferences conclu 
sions and making use in both cases of the same 
causal and illative conjunctions because inasmuch 
then therefore consequently the only feasible plan 
seems to be to discriminate them as species of the 
same genus it seems impossible without altering 
the whole structure of language to do otherwise 

another consideration in favour of this method 
is that not only are contingent and demonstra 
tive reasoning often intermingled but there is 
much reasoning as i shall hereafter explain which

contingent reasoning 

partakes of the character of both which while it 
is contingent in reality is demonstrative in form 

what is the most appropriate specific appella 
tion that could be adopted for that reasoning 
which is not demonstrative is a question of some 
nicety nor will i pertinaciously contend that i 
have made the best possible choice in selecting the 
term contingent 

some authors as already stated call this species 
of reasoning moral and others probable while a 
third class use the two epithets interchangeably 
to the term moral there is the objection that it is 
already used in several acceptations and further 
that the reasoning so designated frequently relates 
to purely physical or material subjects to the 
term probable there is the objection that it is 
usually employed in the sense of likely and is 
qualified by epithets expressive of degrees cases 
might easily be imagined in which these two senses 
would clash e g it might happen that we should 
have to prove by probable reasoning that an event 
was exceedingly improbable 

 “ the word probable says mr stewart “ does not imply 
i e when philosophically used any deficiency in the proof 
but only marks the particular nature of that proof as contra 
distinguished from another species of evidence it is op 
posed not to what is certain but to what admits of being 
demonstrated after the manner of mathematicians this differs 
widely from the meaning annexed to the same word in popular 
discourse according to which whatever event is said to be 
probable is understood to be expected with some degree of 
doubt” — elements vol ii p

 the theory of reasoning 

perhaps one of the best designations is inductive 
which was employed by dr reid in his earliest 
work but which he appears to have subsequently 
laid aside since induction however as commonly 
understood denotes a complex operation viz col 
lecting and scrutinizing facts preparatory to in 
ferring a general law from them and sometimes 
inferring the general law itself the designation 
seems hardly appropriate in simple cases where as 
is often done in this species of reasoning we infer 
one particular fact from another 

the terms moral probable inductive contin 
gent and demonstrative direct the attention to 
the nature of the proofs or evidence before the 
mind but we might select names which would 
point to the intellectual operations themselves 

hume and other writers in discussing the 
origin of the inferences we draw from the past to 
the future from the known to the unknown have 
ascribed them to instinct and philosophers gene 
rally have referred our discernment of the steps in 
demonstrative deductions to intuition 

adopting this view and this phraseology we 
might denominate the first species of reasoning 


 see several passages in his “ sceptical doubts” and 
“ sceptical solution of these doubts” i will quote however 
a passage from his “ academical philosophy ” on account of 
its brevity certainly not of its consistency “ nothing leads 
us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our 
nature” — essays and treatises vol ii p

instinctive and the second intuitive we infer in 
stinctivelythat the bread we are eating will nourish 
the body as other bread has done we conclude in 
tuitively that the lines a and b being respectively 
equal to c are equal to each other 

on giving the subject however the best consi 
deration in my power i have preferred the terms 
contingent and demonstrative without precluding 
myself from the occasional use of any others when 
no misunderstanding can arise if the former is 
not absolutely the most appropriate in regard to 
which there is fair scope for diversity of taste and 
judgment it will at all events enable me to ex 
plain my views with sufficient precision respect

contingent reasoning distinguished from knowing 
on the one hand and conjecturing on the other 

there is one objection which i am aware may 
be urged against the view now presented of the 
reasoning process in contingent matters and it is 
this that it would dignify nearly every intellectual 
act with the name of reasoning that it would on 
the one hand confound reasoning with positive 
knowing and on the other with mere conjectur

ing embracing many cases of instantaneous and 
habitual apprehension which it would seem puerile 
to terra cases of inference and many others which 
are bare guesses or whims of the imagination 

the allegations here supposed might however 
be allowed might even be true without at all in 
validating the representation of the reasoning pro 
cess against which they are directed it would be 
no impeachment of the doctrine of this treatise to 
admit that although there is a broad distinction 
between the mental acts alleged to be confounded 
when we consider very decided cases yet in many 
instances it would be difficult to draw a line of 
demarcation on either side the colours of the 
rainbow which are sufficiently contrasted when we 
regard the middle of each stripe are so insensibly 
blended together that it is impossible to perceive 
where one ends and the other begins yet no one 
on this account denies the existence of the seven 
prismatic colours or the propriety of giving them 
separate names and in the same way what 
ever difficulty there might be in drawing a line 
between knowing and reasoning and reasoning 
and conjecturing in certain instances these 
operations might still be regarded as perfectly dis

such a line nevertheless may i think be drawn 
in the former and principal of these cases although 
it may not be altogether coincident with common

contingent reasoning 


 


the doctrine of the preceding pages is that 
when our minds are determined by present facts 
conjoined with experience or knowledge to believe 
some fact past absent or future we reason 

from the sounds which at the moment of writ 
ing i hear through the open window of my room 
i am led to conclude that there is a lark warbling 
in the sky although i am unable to see it the 
printed page before me superinduces upon my 
mind the belief that at some antecedent period 
human beings put together the words and im 
pressed the characters on the paper although i 
have not the slightest information regarding the 
individuals who did so in like manner i feel 
assured that the buds on the rosetrees in the 
shrubbery will soon expand into fullblown 
flowers and that the stone which i see a boy 
about to throw into the fishpond will sink in the 
water 

these according to the definition are all cases of 
reasoning on examining them they all agree in 
this that from something actually present to 
my senses conjoined with past experience i feel 
satisfied that something has happened or will 
happen or is happening beyond the sphere of my 
personal observation 

the objection we are considering would go to 
maintain that these are not all cases of reasoning 
but that some of them are cases of knowledge 
“ we know it may be said “ that the stone which 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


we hold in our hands will sink when thrown into 
the water we do not infer it” 

but may not the same be asserted with equal 
truth of the usual examples of reasoning given in 
logical treatises when it is argued that peter is 
mortal e will die because he is a man and all 
men are mortal is not my knowledge or belief that 
peter is mortal exactly on a level with my know 
ledge or belief that a stone will sink in water 
and if the former is a legitimate conclusion from 
premises or an inference is not the latter equally so 

it will be readily granted on all hands that what 
has taken place before my eyes i know i know 
for example that i threw a stone yesterday into 
the water and that it sank but with what pro 
priety or correctness can i be said to know that the 
same stone will sink if i again throw it into the 
water today and if this act of intelligence 
which regards an event that has not yet happened 
is to be called knowledge can i be said to know 
that a different stone will sink and if this is 
also to be called knowledge can i be said to know 
that another substance which i have never tried 
but which appears almost as heavy as stone will 
sink too 

suppose the weight attenuated suppose a number 
of substances presented to me varying from the 
weight of granite to that of cork where in this de 
scending scale of untried substances does know 
ledge end and inference or conjecture begin 


 


contingent reasoning 


 


there appears to me to be only one solution of this 
difficulty and one line to be drawn in philoso 
phical strictness we can be said to know only those 
things which we perceive or have perceived through 
our organs of sense and those states of mind or 
mental events of which we are or have been 
conscious 

other things we believe on evidence more or 
less cogent that is to say they are matters of in 
ference the only difficulty in the question seems 
to be whether when we assume or think that the 
same identical properties which we have once per 
ceived are possessed continuously by the same 
identical thing our intellectual state or act is to 
be termed inferring or knowing whether in the 
case already put w r hen i make sure that the same 
stone which i saw sink in the water yesterday 
will sink again when thrown into the water to 
day i know the stone will sink or i only infer it 
and this when maturely considered seems to be 
a question of terminology and not of fact 

there are certainly reasons to be urged al 
though they are difficult to explain why in this 
case we should use the term knowing what do 
we mean by the expression “ the same thing we 
mean a definite portion of matter possessing cer 
tain perceptible qualities — a definite congeries in 
fact of such qualities when then i feel sure of 
finding in future the same object to possess the same 
qualities as heretofore it is only feeling assured 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


that a definite portion of matter will continue to 
be what it is — to continue in fact to exist 

i perceive the properties of a piece of gold i 
put it aside in my cabinet when i take it out 
again i rely upon the continued existence of those 
properties it is the properties themselves which 
constitute the whole object knowledge of it can 
consist of nothing else than a cognizance of these 
qualities and as i ascribe permanence to the ob 
ject i ascribe permanence to the qualities the 
assemblage of which in truth forms the object 
and i speak of them independently of reference to 
time 

but even in this case there is an inference that 
the definite portion of matter continues unaffected 
by surrounding agents that is to say without 
any addition or diminution or any change of in 
ternal structure we may conclude that it con 
tinues the same from its not having as far as 
appearances indicate been exposed to the action 
of such agents but as these are often extremely 
subtle and imperceptible we cannot know this 
instead of putting aside a piece of gold i put aside 
a vessel of water it is apparently protected from 
alteration internal or external but the weather 
becomes colder the temperature of the water falls 
and although the liquid may appear the same to 
the eye it has really undergone either a diminu 
tion or enlargement of bulk its continuing there 
fore to have the same properties is what i infer not 


 



contingent reasoning 


 


what i know for if i consider it to have the same 
specific gravity as before i am in error 

on these grounds notwithstanding the instan 
taneousness and certainty and familiarity of our 
intelligence in cases of this kind they ought phi 
losophically to be considered as cases of inferring 
and not of knowing 

whether this be considered a satisfactory view 
of the subject or not it fortunately happens that 
the determination of the difficulty is of no prac 
tical moment there can be no great evil in con 
founding knowledge and inference in cases where 
they are so hard to be distinguished or rather 
where there is so little reason for preferring one 
term to another and where whatever name we 
give to the intellectual act it is marked by so 
much promptitude and certainty 

while on the one hand the conclusions of reason 
when indubitable and familiar are with difficulty 
distinguished from facts actually known on the 
other hand it is not easy according to the objec 
tion before us to distinguish them when they are 
founded on doubtful premises from what are called 
guesses or hypotheses but in this case the solu 
tion lies on the surface we impose one name 
or the other according to the degree of evidence 

when the grounds for believing any thing are 
slight we term the mental act or state induced a 
conjecture when they are strong we term it an 
inference or conclusion increase the evidence 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


for a conjecture it becomes a conclusion diminish 
the evidence for a conclusion it passes into a con 
jecture 

the process which ends in a conclusion and the 
process which ends in a conjecture are thus essen 
tially the same and differ only in degree or in the 
force of the evidence a conjecture therefore if 
it has any grounds is a species of conclusion if it 
has none it may be called a mere guess a whim 
or caprice or sally of the imagination or any thing 
else implying disconnexion with proofs and pre 
mises which the reader may choose to term it but 
it has no claim to the appellation of inference 

after this discussion it is scarcely needful to 
combat the phraseology of hobbes who styles all 
that have denominated contingent reasoning 
conjecturing if the latter term were not con 
fined to cases in which the grounds of inference 
are slight all conclusions from historical facts 
would pass under the name of guesses and the 
criminal found guilty of murder on circumstantial 
evidence might be said to be hanged on con 
jecture

demonstrative reasoning 

let us turn in the next place to the second 
species of reasoning in which certain things or 
facts lead us to discern other things or facts not 
immediately manifest by themselves an example 
of it having been already given in the first chap 
ter and a still more detailed one being intended 
for the appendix in order to avoid interrupting 
the exposition of the subject by too great particu 
larity the simplest instance will here suffice the 
lines a and b are respectively equal to c and 
therefore they are equal to each other 

here the mind observing successively the 
equality of a to c and that of b to c is thence led 
to discern the mutual equality of a and b which 
is not selfevident or immediately discernible from 
the inspection of a and b alone 

it is plain that in reasoning of this second 
species which is with great propriety termed de 
monstrative we intuitively discern at each step 
that one fact implies another and discern too 
that a denial of the implied fact involves a con 
tradiction 

but demonstrative reasoning is not confined to 

 see appendix article 

d 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


the science of quantity it is to be found in all 
departments of human knowledge 

whenever the mind discerns one fact to be im 
plied in another or the exclusion of a fact to be 
implied in another fact it reasons demonstratively 
whether they are facts of quantity or otherwise 

examples of this truth might be multiplied 
without end but the few which follow will be 
sufficient for illustration 

that portrait is a striking likeness of two dif 
ferent persons therefore they must resemble each 
other 

the two litigants cannot both be the exclusive 
owners of the property in dispute therefore one 
of them must be urging a wrong claim 

the traveller who was attacked had no money 
with him therefore he could not be robbed of a 
large sum as reported 

the planets are opaque bodies therefore they 
must shine by light derived from an external source 

under this species of reasoning must be ranked 
that which is usually denominated syllogistic but 
which i shall venture to call classreasoning be 
cause perfect specimens of it as i shall hereafter 
show are found in the form of enthymemes 

of classreasoning or at least of so much of it 
as exemplifies the maxim of aristotle termed the 
dictum de omni et nullo the characteristic is in 
ferring some attribute to belong or not to belong 
to a given individual or to given individuals of a 
class because it belongs to all or does not belong 


 


demonstrative reasoning 


 


to any of the individuals of the class it would 
be clearly a selfcontradiction to admit the latter 
and to deny the former all such reasoning is 
obviously demonstrative it is indeed largely in 
terfused in geometrical demonstration in which 
general propositions not selfevident but which 
have been shown to be implied in other proposi 
tions are subsequently employed as major pre 
mises such for example are the propositions 
that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle 
are equal that the three angles of every triangle 
are together equal to two right angles and that 
all equilateral triangles are equiangular 

that all demonstrative reasoning consists in 
discerning and when expressed in words in as 
serting one fact or one proposition to be implied 
in another is plain if we call one the implying 
fact the other will be of course the implied fact as 
in the following examples 


implying facts 

all horned animals are rumi 
nant 

the lines a and b are severally 
equal to c 

the three angles of every tri 
angle are together equal to 
two right angles 

the culprit at the bar was in 
edinburgh at one o’clock on 
the day named 

the traveller had no money 
with him 

the portrait resembles two 
different persons 


implied facts 

this horned animal is rumi 
nant 

the lines a and b are equal to 
each other 

the three angles of the tri 
angle abc are equal to two 
right angles 

he could not be guilty of the 
offence committed at thnt 
time in london 

he could not be robbed of a 
a large sum 

they must resemble each 
other 

 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


by the terms implying and being implied nothing 
is assumed they are merely expressive of the 
truth that when the two facts so denominated are 
presented together to the mind the proposition 
enunciating the second fact is at once seen to be 
true if the proposition enunciating the first is 
true and the denial of it to involve a contradic 
tion nor is it pretended that this mode of stating 
an argument is superior for common purposes to 
the usual forms 

if we examine the general principles on which 
demonstrative reasoning proceeds or which it ex 
emplifies we shall find less uniformity than in the 
case of contingent reasoning 

the general principle exemplified in the argu 
ment that a and b are equal to each other because 
they are respectively equal to c is that things 
equal to the same thing are equal to each other 
in the demonstration cited in the first chapter 
that the opposite angles made by the intersection 
of two right lines are equal the reasoning con 
sists of two steps the first of which proceeds on 
the same axiom while the second exemplifies the 
axiom that if equals are taken from equals the 
remainders are equal 

in the argument that because the culprit at the 
bar was in edinburgh at a given time he could 
not be guilty of a crime committed at that precise 
moment in london the general principle exem

plified is that a man cannot be in two places at 
the same time 

axioms might easily be educed in the same 
way from the other examples of demonstrative in 
ference furnished in the preceding pages but as 
i purpose to resume the consideration of such 
maxims in a subsequent chapter it would be 
superfluous to dwell upon them here in that 
chapter i shall enter into an express examination 
of the general principles exemplified in classrea 
soning one of which has become so noted under 
the name of the dictum de omni et nullo 

the remark before made regarding the cogency 
of the process in the first species of reasoning 
may be repeated with regard to the second its 
cogency is not susceptible of proof if the argu 
ment that “ because a and b are respectively equal 
to c they are equal to each other” is not intui 
tively discerned to be true nothing can make it 
appear so it would be idle too in this case as 
in the case of probable reasoning to cite the 
general principle with a view to strengthen the 
force of the particular instance the maxim that 
all things which are equal to the same thing are 
equal to each other springs up in the mind after 
the mutual equality of two particular things which 
are equal to a third thing has been discerned and 
is merely a generalisation of what the particular 
fact implies a truth which will be more fully 
elucidated in the two following chapters

tiie theory of reasoning 


i have already remarked that all classreasoning 
or what is usually termed syllogistic is in form at 
least demonstrative this is i believe univer 
sally allowed but it has been objected against 
such reasoning that the major premise virtually 
contains the conclusion and consequently every 
argument of the kind involves a petitio principii or 
at least furnishes no real or no new inference 

what truth there is in this allegation and 
whether if true it renders classreasoning nuga 
tory and useless it may be instructive to examine 
in this examination i shall confine myself at pre 
sent to those cases of classreasoning which ac 
cording to a common logical distinction are de 
monstrative both in form and in matter as i 
purpose in the next chapter to consider such as are 
really contingent although bearing the semblance 
of demonstration in order to simplify the dis 
cussion i shall also confine myself as my prede 
cessors have usually done to such classreasoning 

• see campbell’s philosophy of rhetoric book i chap iv 
and stewarts elements of philosophy vol ii p des 
cartes had long before made a similar observation “ to con 
vince ourselves” says he “ how little this syllogistic art serves 
towards the discovery of truth we may remark that the 
logicians can form no syllogism with a true conclusion unless 
they are already acquainted with the truth that the syllogism 
developes hence it follows that the vulgar logic is wholly 
useless to him who would discover truth for himself though it 
may assist in explaining to others the truth he already knows”

demonstrative reasoning 


 


as exemplifies the first half of aristotle’s maxim 
viz de omni without expressly touching on such 
as exemplifies the second half de nullo or any 
other maxims allied to the dictum 

if it were intended to signify simply that the 
major premise implies the conclusion the objection 
would allege as an imperfection what is the 
essential characteristic of all demonstrative reason 
ing whatever inasmuch as in every case of it one 
fact or proposition termed the premise with or 
without the aid of another premise as will be here 
after explained implies another fact or proposition 
termed the conclusion if the first did not imply 
the second i e if of the two facts when viewed 
together one were not discerned to be conclusively 
connected with the other there could be no such 
thing as demonstration 

but the objection is that the major premise not 
merely implies but contains the conclusion that 
the conclusion is in reality a constituent or inte 
grant part of the major premise without which 
the latter would not be completely true 

this allegation it must be confessed cannot be 
contradicted the force of the reasoning in a 
demonstrative syllogism or an enthymeme with 
a major premise depends altogether on the fact 
expressed in the conclusion forming an integrant 
part of the general fact expressed in the major 
proposition and consequently no new or unknown 
fact can ever appear as the inference 

d 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


the essence of the conclusion in such cases 
consists in asserting that the subject of it does 
form an integrant part of the major premise 

but although the allegation must be admitted 
it does not by any means prove that such reasoning 
is nugatory or useless it may obviously be of 
service to be reminded or to remind others or to 
have distinctly brought into view that a given 
individual of a class possesses a certain attribute 
when there is at the moment no other evidence to 
prove it by citing the known or admitted fact 
that all the members of the class possess it 

as an illustration of this point suppose i am 
engaged in the demonstration of a geometrical 
theorem there is before me a complicated dia 
gram containing amongst several figures a tri 
angle which i have to compare with other figures 
and as a step in the reasoning i have to show 
that the angles of the triangle in question are 
together equal to two right angles i have not 
gone through the proofs with this particular tri 
angle but i call to mind that i have seen the 
proposition demonstrated of all triangles what 
ever and from it as an established truth the con 
clusion that the angles of the triangle in the 
diagram although not expressly investigated are 
together equal to two right angles irresistibly 
follows it is simply thinking or saying “ in all 
triangles the three angles are equal to two right 
angles and of course the particular triangle before 
us is included in the general fact” 


 



demonstrative reasoning 


 


whether the declaration or recognition of such 
a contained fact is to be termed an inference or 
not seems to be a question of phraseology 

i am myself disposed to think that any fact 
which can be shown to be implied or contained in 
another fact may be conveniently and properly 
said to be inferred from it and that the process 
may be with equal convenience and propriety 
termed reasoning it is true that on this plan 
many implied facts when expressed in words 
would assume the appearance of fruitless and 
frivolous inferences and seem as the phrase is 
“ not entitled to the name” but a similar re 
mark might be made with regard to many other 
convenient designations we give the name pro 
position for example to any expression which 
affirms or denies one thing of another and far 
from withholding it from trite and flat phrases 
and truisms we constantly speak of puerile nuga 
tory and identical propositions in the same 
manner we talk of bad poetry and wretched 
painting although the critic in his righteous in 
dignation may cry out do you call this poetry 
it is sheer rant do you dignify this with the 
name of painting it is a mere daub it would be 
in analogy with these examples to apply the term 
inference to any proposition before which we can

properly use the word therefore marking our sense 
of its low character when requisite by such epi 
thets as useless or frivolous of this description 
would be the logical trifling sometimes cited — 
all men are fallible 

therefore some men are fallible 

but there are other propositions prefaced by 
therefore which although generally banished from 
the rank of conclusions or regarded as mere ex 
amples of conversion might be classed amongst 
the really useful inferences e g 

no man is infallible 

therefore no infallible being is a man 

all instances of the conversion of propositions 
indeed are really instances of demonstrative rea 
soning they are pure enthymemes which re 
quire no major premises although it is perfectly 
practicable as it is perfectly useless to throw them 
into the full syllogistic form of this i shall fur 
nish proof in a subsequent chapter on the forms 
in which the operations of reasoning may be ex 
pressed 

the last example in truth represents a class of 
demonstrative inferences exceedingly common 
where the same fact is presented in two different 
aspects or approached by the mind in two oppo 
site directions and an assertion is made that be 
cause it is true in one aspect it is true in the 
other 


 



demonstrative reasoning 


 


these two aspects are sometimes positive and 
negative as 

the man we are speaking of is enslaved by his 
appetites 

therefore he is not free 

they are sometimes active and passive as 

the duke of wellington vanquished bonaparte 

therefore bonaparte was vanquished by the 
duke 

sometimes such inferences amount to little more 
than varieties in the expression of the same fact 
and many of them undoubtedly seem puerile but 
they are demonstrative and notwithstanding their 
apparent puerility when standing alone they are 
often convenient steppingstones in argumentative 
discourse when their trivial character is merged in 
their transitional utilityf 

all these we may rank amongst convenient and 
useful inferences and with equal reason we may 
place in the same class such as we have been en 
gaged in discussing — those namely of really de 
monstrative syllogisms — notwithstanding the un

deniable fact that the conclusion is always contained 
in the major premise 

the admission of this truth detracts it must be 
owned from the importance of demonstrative class 
reasoning as it stands in general estimation and 
circumscribes such reasoning within very narrow 
boundaries 

it is an obvious reflection that if no fact can be 
inferred in syllogistic reasoning but what is con 
tained in the major proposition no science can 
possibly be constructed by a series of real or legi 
timate syllogisms alone hence there must be a 
fallacy in the assertion that the science of geometry 
can be exhibited in such a series this feat has i 
am aware been ostensibly accomplished and the 
way in which it has been performed presents no

duction of redundant propositions merely incum 
bering the demonstration and disguising the real 
source of the validity of those arguments into

contingent under the form of demonstrative 
reasoning 

i have now taken a survey of contingent and 
demonstrative reasoning and endeavoured to show 
the nature and cogency of each species and also 
the general principles on which they proceed or 
which they exemplify 

but i have still to notice a large class of cases in 
reasoning which partake of the character of both 
which while they are contingent in reality are 
demonstrative in form 

it has been already explained that the formation 
of general laws extending beyond the observed 
facts from which they are derived is in every 
instance an act of contingent reasoning that 
general laws rest on the same evidence or are de 
duced from the same premises as particular in 
ferences 

it is nevertheless a common and often a very 
convenient practice first to deduce the general 
law and afterwards from the general law to draw 
the particular inference which then wears the ap 
pearance of a demonstrated truth 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


the subject may be elucidated by an instance of 
reasoning similar to one before given 

all human beings as far as observation has 
extended have been found fallible 

therefore the unknown author of the book 
just put into my hands is fallible 

this which is a good material argument an 
instance of forcible contingent reasoning may be 
converted into the following demonstration by as 
suming as a major premise the general law which 
is deducible from the preceding uniform fact 

all human beings are fallible 

therefore the author of this book is fallible 

it is obvious nevertheless that the real nature 
of the reasoning cannot be altered by changing 
the form in which it is expressed the evidence 
of the fallibility of human beings consists in pre 
vious known instances of the intellectual qualities 
exhibited by them and the conclusion drawn from 
these instances is as to the intellectual qualities of a 
writer concerning whom we know nothing the 
process is really inferring from what has existed in 
all similar i e all other cases what exists in this 
case 

as a further illustration let us examine a piece 
of reasoning often cited in logical treatises 

all horned quadrupeds are ruminant 

therefore this horned quadruped is ruminant 

whether we take this enthymeme as it is or 
make it by the introduction of a minor premise 
into a regular syllogism the conclusion drawn is 


 



indirect contingent reasoning 


 


irresistible you cannot admit the premise and 
deny the conclusion without selfcontradiction 

but the form into which the reasoning is thrown 
by using the general law as a major premise masks 
the real nature of the evidence for the conclusion 
the real argument is 

all other horned quadrupeds have been found 
to be ruminant 

therefore this horned quadruped is ruminant 

it is because we have found horned quadrupeds 
to have been ruminant in all other cases as far as 
our knowledge has extended that we conclude 
that the horned animal before us is ruminant the 
fact or collection of facts gathered from observation 
without any contrary instance is sufficient to de 
termine the mind to believe the conclusion but 
there would be no selfcontradiction although a 
want of sound sense in admitting the premise and 
denying the inference the reason is not what is 
usually designated logical or demonstrative but 
material or contingent it is nevertheless all that 
we can possibly have in the case 

laying down the general law that all homed 
quadrupeds are ruminant has not the slightest 
power to change either the character of the facts 
of which it is the indication or that of the conclu 
sion to which it may lead material arguments 
cannot be converted into demonstrative proofs by 
any arrangement of propositions or by any trans 
lation from one form into another 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


in these observations i do not of course intend 
to assert that we ought never to make our in 
ferences from such general propositions for there is 
obviously a natural tendency in the human mind 
to do so and an indispensable convenience in the 
practice i simply maintain that they do not in 
crease or strengthen or alter in any way the real 
force of the proofs being conclusions of precisely 
the same nature and resting on the same evidence 
as the particular conclusions sought to be demon 
strated by them it follows that no force can be 
derived from them to the latter 

perhaps it would be a useful way of marking 
the distinction between these two modes of con 
tingent reasoning to call one the direct and the 
other the indirect 

the difference might be illustrated and exhibited 
to the eye in a diagram where the point or angle 
a denotes the collective fact 
b „ the general law 
c „ the particular inference 

supposing the distances between 
the points to be equal or what is 
the same thing the triangle to be 
equilateral it is obvious that if you proceed in 
a straight course from a you may get to b or to c 
with equal readiness but you may also get to c 

 this argument has been forcibly put by mr john mill in 
his valuable system of logic see vol i p 



digitized by googli 


indirect contingent reasoning 


 


by first going from a to b and then from b to c 
the first would be the direct way the second the 
indirect so inferring from the collective fact “ all 
men have hitherto been found fallible ” a that 
this man is fallible c would be a direct inference 
from the evidence as would be also inferring from 
the same collective fact that all men are fallible b 
but inferring from the general law “ all men are 
fallible ” that this man is fallible although direct 
if no reference is made to the original ground 
would be an indirect way of deducing the particular 
inference from the pristine evidence on which it 
rests it would be going from a to c vid b 

it often happens indeed to pursue the parallel 
that we find ourselves at b and then if we want to 
proceed to c it would be roundabout to retrace our 
steps first to a when we have already reached a 
general law we may safely and usefully deduce 
conclusions from it without the constant necessity 
of reascending to the original evidence 

it follows nevertheless that the universal law 
which is itself merely an inference in contingent 
reasoning cannot be rightly employed as a de 
monstrative major premise to prove a particular 
conclusion without what may be called a logical 
reservation the conclusion is not in reality a 
necessary consequence of the evidence although 

 it is scarcely necessary to say that the diagram above in 
troduced is not intended to prove any thing it is merely an 
attempt to place the subject in a clear light 

e 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


the shape into which the argument is thrown will 
make it appear such and deducing it from the 
universal law can be considered only as a form of 
which it is frequently convenient to avail ourselves 
but in using which we should never forget the 
contingent character of the argument in effect 
if we closely scrutinise the subject we shall find 
that the only kinds of general propositions which 
can be legitimately regarded as implying individual 
facts and thus employed absolutely as demon 
strative premises are two namely such as are 
formed from a complete knowledge or discernment 
that the predicate is true of every individual of the 
class which embraces the enumeratio plena of logi 
cians and such as are rigidly deduced from incon 
trovertible data an example of the former may 
be seen in the propositions “all the planets are 
opaque bodies” “ all murders are punishable by 
death ” of the latter in the theorem “ all equilateral 
triangles are equiangular 

in all other cases however forcible or welles 
tablished or undeniable the general law may be the 
reasoning in which it is employed as a major pre 
mise although demonstrative in form comes under 
the description of contingent reasoning and can 
be correctly regarded in no other light 

from all this the necessity of knowing the pre 
cise signification of the terms used in classreason 
ins before we can determine the real nature of the 
inference drawn is an obvious corollary 


 



indirect contingent reasoning 


 


but the most important application of this view 
of the subject is that it enables us to see how com 
pletely such apparently demonstrative reasoning 
escapes the objection brought against syllogistic 
arguments and adverted to in the last chapter 
that the major premise virtually contains the con 
clusion and that consequently the argument in 
volves a petitio principii and furnishes no real in 
ference 

many minds have been perplexed in attempting 
to reconcile the admitted truth that the conclusion 
forms an integrant part of the general proposition 
from which we set out with the equally acknow 
ledged truth that from such propositions we deduce 
unobserved facts not really included in the major 
premise 

but the view of the subject here presented re 
moves the whole difficulty whatever weight the 
allegation of a petitio principii may have in the case 
of purely demonstrative classarguments it can 
have no application to such as we are here treating 
of when thrown back into their pristine form 
although it may lie against an argument in the 
shape of 

all men are fallible 

therefore this man is fallible 
it cannot for a moment be brought against one in 
the shape of 

all other men have been fallible 

therefore this man is fallible 

e 


 



 


tiie theory of reasoning 


which is the true type of contingent reasoning from 
collective facts or general propositions 

in this latter case all semblance of petitio prin 
cipii vanishes the difficulty is cleared up a fact 
is inferred which has not been observed and is not 
included in the premise and as the greater part 
of our reasoning from general propositions respect 
ing the events around us material and moral is 
of this character however it may wear the guise 
of demonstration the objection before us as al 
ready intimated can at the utmost have only a 
comparatively limited application viz to deduc 
tions from such general propositions as can alone 
be employed absolutely as demonstrative major 
premises 

perhaps the subject may be rendered clearer to 
some readers by the following dialogue 

a it is surely demonstrative reasoning when i 
conclude that this man is fallible because all men 
are fallible 

b that is to say because every individual man 
is fallible 

a of course 

b in asserting every individual man to be fal 
lible do you include this man or do you not 

a i include all men and him amongst the rest 

b then your argument is this “ every indi 
vidual man including this man is fallible therefore 
this man is fallible” in other words you argue 


 



indirect contingent reasoning 

that this man is fallible because he is fallible which 
is certainly demonstrative enough 

a of course the reason really meant to be as 
signed is that all other men as far as observation 
has extended have been found to be fallible 

b that is to say all men excluding this 
man have been found to be fallible therefore this 
excluded man is fallible now this is a good 
material or contingent reason but it is not a de 
monstratively conclusive one in the case of every 
demonstrated truth the opposite or negative pro 
position would be a contradiction in terms that 
this man is not fallible would be a contradiction to 
the proposition that all men are fallible but not 
to the proposition that all other men are fallible 
thus if you include this man you beg the ques 
tion if you do not include him your reason is a 
material or contingent one very highly probable 
engendering almost complete certainty but not 
demonstratively conclusive 

what has been said in this chapter may appear 
on a first glance to correspond with the well 
known distinction made by aristotle between de 
monstrative and dialectical syllogisms but there 
is a fundamental difference which it may be well 
to note his words are “ the syllogism is a form 
of language in which certain things being laid 
down another thing different from those laid down 
necessarily results from them now demonstra 
tion takes place when a conclusion is drawn from 

e 


 



 


tiie theory of reasoning 


things true and primary or from those of which 
the knowledge has been derived from the true and 
primary but in a dialectical syllogism the con 
clusion is drawn from probable things the true 
and primary are such things as are believed of 
themselves and not on account of other things for 
it behoves not that in the principles of a science 
the reason why should be sought for but every 
principle should be certain in itself” 

this is in truth merely saying that when the 
premises are only probable the conclusion will be 
so too and giving the appellation of dialectical to 
syllogisms in which they occur

the same point is thus explained by wallis 

“ syllogismus topicus qui et dialecticus dici solet et dida

series qui firmam potius praesumptionem seu opinionem valde 
probabilem creat quam absolutam certitudinem non quidem

saltern probabiles atque ut plurimum verte ” — institutio logi 
ca lib iii cap 


 



indirect contingent reasoning 


 


but this is not all that is maintained in the pre 
sent chapter nor even the material part of it 

my doctrine is that all such reasoning as con 
sists in inferring unobserved facts from general 
propositions although strictly demonstrative in 
form is in reality contingent how certain and 
indisputable soever the general propositions may 
be and that it is represented by the formula 

all other men have been found fallible 
therefore this man whose fallibility has never 
been observed is fallible 

according to my view consequently many syl 
logisms would rank in the class of arguments 
demonstrative in form but contingent in reality 
besides those which in the popular use of the 
term probable have only probable premises if i 
understand aristotle aright the latter alone would 
fall under his denomination of dialectical 

it has been well observed by mr stewart in re 
ference to this distinction in the first book of the 
topics that there is an impropriety in such an 
employment of the epithets demonstrative and dia 
lectical inasmuch as it implies or seems to imply 
that one species of syllogism may be more con 
clusive and cogent than another which is at 
variance with aristotle’s own doctrine in other 
places and of course was not intended here

the intermixture of contingent and demon 
strative reasoning 

it seems necessary in order to complete our sur 
vey of the two great divisions of the subject to 
advert more particularly to a circumstance already 
indicated in some of the examples introduced into 
the preceding exposition viz that demonstrative 
reasoning even when nonsyllogistic is by no 
means confined to mathematics or the science of 
quantity but it is perpetually intermixed with 
contingent reasoning on matters of a moral or a 
physical nature 

this might be exemplified by a thousand in 
stances in common life take for example the 
course pursued by an advocate in defending his 
client from a criminal accusation if he relies as 
he is sometimes compelled to do upon testimony 
to his client’s character the argument is purely 
contingent he attempts to establish the moral 
excellence of the man and then infers that a per 
son of such estimable qualities would not be likely 
to commit the offence of which he is accused but 
if instead of this he endeavours to prove an alibi 
the logical procedure is altered the crime we 
will suppose was committed in london and he 


 



intermix che of arguments 


 


produces several credible witnesses who swear 
that at the very moment when the deed was per 
petrated they saw the accused in edinburgh in 
this hypothetical case the reasoning of the defence 
is mixed when from the number and respecta 
bility and concurrence of the witnesses the advo 
cate infers that their testimony is true he employs 
a contingent argument but when he proceeds 
further and concludes from the attested fact of his 
client’s being in edinburgh that he could not have 
committed a crime at the same moment in lon 
don this step in the reasoning is demonstrative 

we may observe a similar intermixture of rea 
soning on very various occasions and amongst the 
rest on the common occasion of making indirect com 
parisons between objects and qualities of all kinds 

if two substances for example which could not 
be brought into juxtaposition are attested to have 
been successively compared with a third substance 
and found to be respectively of the same colour 
with it we conclude that they agree in colour with 
each other 

in this case while the inference that the two 
mutually unapproachable substances are each of 
the same colour with the third resting as it does 
on testimony is contingent the conclusion that 
therefore the two former substances resemble each 
other in colour is necessary a demonstrated 
conclusion however from a premise which has 
been obtained by contingent reasoning must itself

participate in the uncertainty of the premise a 
chain as some one has well observed in elucida 
tion of this point may be composed of both strong 
and weak links but its strength as a chain can 
never be greater than that of the weakest link 
in it 

the way in which even strictly mathematical 
reasoning — reasoning about quantity — occurs in 
treating of matters of fact is familiar to the stu 
dents of natural science and may be illustrated by 
a short passage from a physiological writer whose 
arguments are frequently close and cogent 

“ in the young of the carnivora” he says “ the 
weight of the body does not remain unchanged 
on the contrary it increases from day to day by an 
appreciable quantity this fact presupposes that 
the assimilative process in the young animal is 
more energetic more intense than the process of 
transformation in the existing tissues if both pro 
cesses were equally active the weight of the body 
could not increase and were the waste by trans 
formation greater the weight of the body would 
decrease” 

this is obviously a strict demonstrative argu 
ment we see intuitively that if the body gains 
weight more matter must be added to it than 
is subtracted from it

gregory p 


 



intermixture of arguments 

to these examples of the intermixture of one 
species of reasoning with another may be added 
the frequent introduction into argumentative dis 
course of other demonstrative enthymemes such as 
i have described in the third chapter and for in 
stances of which the reader may consult the 
appendix 

it may be remarked further that the several 
varieties of demonstrative reasoning as distin 
guished by the general principles which they ex 
emplify are to be found intermingled both with 
contingent reasoning and with each other in 
geometry as it is almost needless to mention ex 
cept to recall the fact to the mind of the reader 
we often find that in the demonstration of a single 
theorem two or three different axioms are succes

principles of reasoning or maxims and 
especially the dictum of aristotle 

although in the preceding chapters it was im 
possible not to touch incidentally on the place 
which axioms hold in reasoning or rather in re 
lation to it yet on account of the erroneous notions 
still prevalent in regard to them notwithstanding 
what has been said by locke in his chapter on 
maxims and by stewart in the d volume of his 
philosophy it may be useful to renew and ex 
tend the discussion of the subject it will not be 
requisite to take into express consideration at the 
same time the analogous general principles of con 
tingent reasoning because any deficiency in my 
previous explanation of their character will be sup 
plied by many of the following remarks which 
mutatis mutandis will apply to them 

in demonstrative reasoning maxims or axioms 
are nothing more or less than selfevident general 
propositions formed from particular arguments 
and every instance of demonstration may be ranged 
under some one or other of them as exemplifying 
it if we take a few of the implying and implied 
facts adduced in the last chapter this will be suf 
ficiently manifest

here it is obvious the maxims are only gene 
ralisations of the particular arguments or of the 
particular instances of implication and the self 
evidence of both maxims and arguments is on a 
level although the priority in respect of origin is 
with the latter 

in reference to these general principles or 
maxims a variety of phrases are employed thus 
by some philosophers an argument is said to pro 
ceed on a certain general principle by others to be 
an application of it to rest or to be founded upon 
it the general principle itself is affirmed to be 
implied in the argument to be involved in it to 
be essential to it while the conclusion is asserted

to be proved by it or in virtue of it these

tively erroneous fail to describe with precision the 
real place occupied by these maxims in relation to 
the reasoning process they can have neverthe 
less only one legitimate meaning the correct 
and most precise mode of stating the matter is to 
say in respect of any particular argument that it 
is an exemplification of a certain general principle 
or maxim and in respect of the general principle 
that it is exemplified in the particular argument or 
is a generalisation of it or may be educed from it 

the phraseology which implies that a conclusion 
is proved by any of these maxims or in virtue of 
them or is dependent upon them for its validity is 
especially objectionable in each of the instances 
of implication quoted above the second fact or 
proposition is intuitively discerned to be implied in 
the first as soon as both are viewed together and 
this discernment of the particular truth is not at all 
dependent on the general maxim which is indeed 
logically the result of subsequent discernment it 
would be more correct to say that the general prin 
ciple is deduced from the particular truth than 
conversely that the particular truth is deduced 
from the general principle 

the latter statement is indeed wholly erroneous 
these maxims have no probative force they add no 
cogency to any argument the conclusion does not 
at all depend upon them they merely present the 
particular argument in a generalised form a form 
which can be reached only through the particular

argument which may happen to be before us or 
another similar to it 

speaking of such selfevident truths locke re 
marks “ they are known in particular instances 
before these general maxims are ever thought on 
and draw all their force from the discernment of 
the mind employed about particular ideas” 

mr stewart who concurred in this view with 
the illustrious author of the essay on human 
understanding gives the following lucid exposi 
tion of his doctrine 

“it was long ago remarked by locke of the 
axioms of geometry as stated by euclid that al 
though the proposition be at first enunciated in 
general terms and afterwards appealed to in its 
particular applications as a principle previously 
examined and admitted yet that the truth is not 
less evident in the latter case than in the former 
he observes further that it is in some of its par 
ticular applications that the truth of every axiom 
is originally perceived by the mind and there 
fore that the general proposition so far from 
being the ground of our assent to the truths which 
it comprehends is only a verbal generalisation of 
what in particular instances has been already 
acknowledged as true” f

the theory of reasoning 


another writer eminent both as a mathematician 
and a philosopher i mean d’alembert gives his 
sanction to the same view and remarks that so 
far are axioms from holding the first rank in phi 
losophy that there is no necessity even to enun 
ciate them he afterwards terms them barren 
and puerile truths 

taking with us these considerations regarding 
the value and position of selfevident maxims let 
us turn to the celebrated dictum of aristotle 

the dictum de omni et nullo viz that “ whatever 
is predicated universally of any class of things 
may be predicated in like manner of any thing 
comprehended in that class” is not only stated by 
logicians to be a general maxim of the applica 
tion of which every direct syllogism is a particular 
instance but proclaimed to be the universal prin 
ciple of reasoning 

if we closely scrutinise the meaning of this 
maxim undazzled by the somewhat magnificent 
and imposing phraseology in which it has been 
spoken of we shall find it an obviously simple 
and undeniable proposition namely whatever is 
asserted of a class may be asserted of any species 
or individual of that class a class however 
we must bear in mind is not a collective or 
corporate whole which as a whole possesses pro

perties or attributes different from those of the in 
dividuals composing it but what is predicated of 
it is predicated of every separate individual ranked 
under it the proposition “ all men are fallible ” 
affirms that every individual man is fallible while 
the proposition “ the army is large ” affirms of the 
body collectively something which it does not af 
firm of any single individual in it if a class were 
such a collective body the aristotelian maxim 
could not be true 

the dictum therefore it is plain means neither 
more nor less than that whatever is predicated of 
every individual of a class may be predicated of 
any individual or any number of individuals of 
that class as however what can be truly pre 
dicated of any thing must be a property or attri 
bute actually possessed we may if we choose 
leave out predication altogether and then the 
maxim will appear in a still simpler shape as fol 
lows what belongs to every individual of a class 
must belong to any individual of that class how 
ever it may be expressed it is obviously a self 
evident and indisputable truth like the other 
maxims we have just been considering and this 


 lord karnes was sharply taken up by dr gillies for 
having blundered on this point he having represented the 
dictum to be “ whatever is true of a number of particulars 
joined together holds true of every one separately” — see

the theory of reasoning 


view of its coordinate character is sufficient of itself 
to determine the accuracy of the doctrine which 
proclaims it as the universal principle of reasoning 

to this point i must draw the reader’s par 
ticular attention for here lies the grand error of 
the aristotelian theory and it is really astonishing 
that a mistake of such magnitude should have been 
so implicitly admitted 

if the doctrine were true every act of reasoning 
would be an exemplification of this one maxim 
and might be ranged under it in other words 
all reasoning without exception would consist in 
concluding that an attribute belongs to some in 
dividual of a class because it belongs to every in 
dividual of that class no other reason according 
to this theory can possibly exist or be assigned 
the sole ground on which we can argue that an 
individual thing possesses any attribute is that 
the thing belongs to a class all the members of 
which possess the attribute the only kind of 
implication possible consists in generic facts im 
plying individual facts 

in contradiction to all this it has been shown 
above that there are many other general principles 
or maxims of which particular acts of reasoning 
are exemplifications such as “ things equal to 

 or is excluded from it i have thought it needless to take 
into separate consideration the de nullo part of the maxim as 
it would lead only to repetitions negative propositions may as 
mr walker says be considered at pleasure as affirmative 


 


principles of reasoning 


 


the same thing are equal to each other ” “ a body 
cannot be in two places at one time ” “ if equals 
are taken from equals the remainders are equal” 
when i affirm that two things a and b are equal 
to each other because they are severally equal to 
c or that a man could not commit a crime at a 
specified time in london because he was at that 
precise moment in edinburgh i reason just as 
much as i do when i affirm that this man is fal 
lible because all men are fallible or that the three 
angles of the triangle before me are together equal 
to two right angles because the three angles of 
every triangle are equal to two right angles 

the dictum then is obviously one of those self 
evident maxims which we have above described 
and it may be exhibited in the same manner

shall see that the dictum de omni et nullo is a cor 
rect expression of the general principle on which 
some acts of reasoning proceed or in more correct 
language which they exemplify but that in this 
respect it is only on a level with other maxims 
such as have been cited 

it may possibly be alleged that at any rate one 
of the instances cited above as exemplifying an 
other maxim may be ranged under the dictum of 
aristotle drawn out at full length it may be 
said the argument in question is as follows 

all things equal to the same thing are equal 
to each other 

a and b are equal to the same thing c 
therefore they are equal to each other 

here it may be urged a and b are argued to 
be equal to each other because they belong to the 
class of things which are equal to the same thing 
but as i shall have occasion to show again when 
treating of the syllogism it is not because they 
belong to any class that we conclude them to be 
equal but it is on account of the particular fact 
of their being respectively equal to c strike out 
all reference to a class expunge the whole of the 
major premise chain down the mind to this single 
instance of equality and still the reasoning is 
complete and the conclusion remains perfectly un 
disturbed this argument consequently is no 
exemplification of the scholastic maxim it shows 
conclusively that ratiocination is not so limited

and insignificant as to consist in nothing else than 
concluding an attribute to belong to an individual 
because it belongs universally to the class of which 
that individual is a member reason refuses to 
be tethered to the stake of the dictum 

logicians themselves moreover admit some of 
them at least that the dictum de omni et nullo is 
not intended or adduced to prove the force of syl 
logistic reasoning for that would be attempting to 
demonstrate the validity of demonstration but it 
is to be considered merely as a generalised state 
ment of all demonstration whatever in a manner 
quite analogous the maxim which appears as the 
major premise in the above syllogism viz “ all 
things equal to the same thing are equal to each 
other” is to be considered as a generalised state 
ment of the particular demonstration that a and b 
being equal to the same thing c are equal to each 
other and of all like cases nor can it be adduced 
any more than the aristotelian maxim to enforce 
an argument already perfectly conclusive 

to show the parity of the two cases we may 
compel the dictum itself to serve as the major pre 

 that i do not here misrepresent the contracted scope as 
signed to reasoning by the scholastic logic is shown in the 
following extract from an able little work on the subject by dr 
whately “ now to remind one on each occasion that so and 
so is referable to such and such a class and that the class which 
happens to be before us comprehends such and such things — 
this is precisely all that is ever accomplished by reasoning

inise of an argument just as easily as we can force 
the mathematical axiom to perform that office and 
we shall find that when so impressed into the ser 
vice it will be equally inefficient 

what can be predicated of a class may be 
predicated of any individual of the class 
mortality can be predicated of the class “ men ” 
therefore mortality may be predicated of the 
individual man peter 

to the conclusiveness of this argument logicians 
must admit in accordance with their own doc 
trine that the dictum major premiss though it 
is lends no force or cogency whatever 

but what i have now alleged to show the limited 
sphere of this celebrated maxim is not all 

so far is the dictum de omni et nullo from having 
any claim to be regarded as the sole principle of 
reasoning that it cannot be correctly considered 
as the sole principle even of syllogistic reasoning 
and this i think is implied in the very doctrines of 
logicians themselves for while they proclaim the 
dictum to be the universal principle they admit 
that it is not directly applicable to any syllogisms 
but such as can be ranged under the four moods 
of the first figure 

now when it is said that a principle or maxim 
is not applicable or even not directly applicable to 
a syllogism it is equivalent to saying that it can 
not be educed or drawn from the syllogism or 


 



principles of reasoning 


 


that the syllogism does not exemplify the maxim 
or proceed upon it 

to acknowledge therefore that the dictum can 
not be directly applied to the syllogisms of the 
three other logical figures is to admit that it is 
not the universal principle even of syllogistic 
reasoning 

and this is the true state of the case the dic 
tum is the principle or the pair of principles 
exemplified by syllogisms in the first figure but 
not by any others each figure exemplifies prin 
ciples of its own allied to the dictum but per 
fectly distinct from it 

there can be no act of demonstrative reasoning 
from which a selfevident maxim cannot be drawn 
and as the kinds of syllogism selected and arranged 
under the figures and moods are all admitted to 
be demonstrative each kind must be capable of 
yielding its maxim in other words from each 
kind a general principle selfevidently true may be 
educed 

accordingly we find that the syllogisms in the 
second figure exemplify a pair of maxims allied to 
the dictum but still distinct from it viz “ when 
the whole of a class possess a certain attribute 
whatever does not possess the attribute does not 
belong to the class” and “ when the whole of a 
class is excluded from the possession of an attri 
bute whatever possesses the attribute does not 
belong to the class”

analogous maxims may be educed from syl 
logisms in the third and fourth figures from each 
of which a single example will probably be thought 
enough 

the maxim for the moods darapti and datisi 
in the third figure is as follows 

“ when the whole of a class possess a certain 
attribute and the whole or part of the class possess 
another attribute then some things that possess 
one possess the other” 

and the following is the maxim for the moods 
bramantip and dimaris in the fourth figure 

“ when the whole or part of a class possess an 
attribute and all things which possess that attri 
bute possess a second then some which possess the 
second belong to the class” 

the preceding maxims except the pair drawn 
from the second figure which are clear enough 
are not it may be allowed so plain or so readily 

 when i drew out the above maxims from the second third 
and fourth figures i was not aware that something of the same 
kind had been previously done by lambert a german author 
with whose treatise i am not fortunate enough to be acquainted 
the reader who wishes to see the maxims as drawn out by 
him will find them quoted in mr mansel’s edition of aldrich 
p and neither was it present to my mind that at a 
much earlier period the principles of the second and third 
figures had been given in the port royal art of thinking 
had these been before me sooner i should not have been at the 
trouble of producing mine as it is i let the maxims stand in 
their original forms which differ in detail from those of my 
predecessors

comprehended as the dictum de omni et nullo but 
this arises from the arguments themselves being 
less simple whence the several parts of each 
maxim are not so easily kept in view together for 
as soon as the terms in which they are expressed 
are understood and their meanings simultaneously 
viewed they are seen to be selfevidently true 
being nevertheless educed from particular argu 
ments which are equally true and more imme 
diately evident they can neither give light nor 
lend force to the syllogisms from which they are 
drawn in brief they are altogether useless 

in these and other respects they are on a level 
with the dictum of aristotle and although allied 
to that dictum they are distinct and true in them 
selves without reference to any thing else 

the principle that a thing possesses a certain 
attribute when all the class to which it belongs pos 
sess it is plainly different from the principle that 
a thing does not belong to a class when it does not 
possess an attribute common to the class 

between these two maxims there is as clear a 
distinction as between the axiom that two quan 
tities are equal to each other when they are re 
spectively equal to a third quantity and the maxim 
that two quantities are equal to each other when 
they are the remainders of two equal quantities 
from each of which the same quantity has been 
taken they are allied but not identical maxims 

it results from this examination that the dic

turn de omni et nullo is very far from having any 
claim to be considered as the universal principle 
of reasoning for to say nothing of its not being 
the principle of direct contingent reasoning it has 
been here shown 

 that it is only one of the principles of de 
monstrative reasoning coordinate with many 
others and 

 that it is not even the sole principle of 
syllogistic reasoning but only of those syllo 
gisms which conform to the first figure 

before concluding it may be useful to advert to 
the importance of distinguishing between such self 
evident general principles or maxims as have here 
been considered and those general propositions re 
garding objects and events which are the results 
of observation nor is it superfluous after the pre 
vious explanations to discriminate and contrast

their truth is discerned as soon as they are under 
stood and denying them is seen to involve a 
contradiction on the other hand a general pro 
position formed from observing a number of facts 
although it may be quite convincing depends for 
that quality on the facts observed and it may be 
called in question without inconsistence or absur 
dity the selfevident maxim cannot be used as a 
proof because the argument which it might be 
employed to confirm is equally selfevident while

tion of facts so far from being an ineffective ge 
neralisation either constitutes or represents the 
whole proof of the particular conclusion sought to 
be established the same remarks will apply 
mutatis mutandis to general theorems obtained by 
deduction from incontrovertible premises having 
been first demonstrated themselves they subse 
quently form the real proofs of particular con 
clusions 

a brief notice may also be usefully bestowed on 
some observations in reference to the present sub 
ject which appear to have originated in a wrong 
apprehension of what maxims are 

it has been alleged as an objection by some 
writers that the dictum de omni et nullo is a prin 
ciple of no great depth and by others that it is a 
selfevident proposition little better than a mere 
truism — allegations clearly well founded but it 
is not so clear how they arc meant to be applied 
or what they are intended to enforce or to illus 
trate 

all the maxims of which acts of demonstrative 
reasoning are exemplifications must from the very 
nature of the case be selfevident propositions and 
consequently may be affirmed to be of no great 
depth such acts of reasoning could not be de 
monstrative if selfevident maxims were not edu 
cible from them to allege this selfevidence as a 
fault or objection is consequently to mistake the

position and value of the maxims which it cha 
racterises 

in treating the dictum of aristotle separately it 
has been impossible to avoid repeating what has 
been already said and forestalling some explana 
tions which will find their fitting places in a sub 
sequent chapter but the erroneous light in which 
logicians have continued even down to our own 
times to view this celebrated maxim seemed to 
call for a particular examination of its true cha 
racter and position

forms of reasoning and especially tiie 
syllogism 

no doctrine is more clearly and unequivocally 
maintained by logicians than the sameness in all 
cases of the reasoning process whatever the sub 
jectmatter of the argument may be and if the 
dictum de omni et nullo truly represented what in 
all cases constitutes reasoning and were the only 
principle on which according to common phraseo 
logy that operation proceeds the doctrine would 
be undeniable 

but in the first place if the account already 
given is accurate there are at least two processes 
of which reasoning is the common name broadly 
distinguished from each other distinct in the na 
ture of the proofs adduced distinct in the prin 
ciples exemplified and distinct in the state of mind 
resulting 

in the second place if we confine our attention 
merely to demonstrative reasoning and look at the 
general principles on which that species of reason 
ing proceeds we find as shown in the two last 
chapters that they are numerous that the dictimi 
de omni et nullo is only one amongst the set and 
if the number of such axioms or principles is to 


 



 


tiie theory of reasoning 


be the criterion demonstrative reasoning must be 
pronounced multiplex if we call it one species of 
reasoning the varieties under this species must be 
formed by a reference to the general principle of 
which each act of reasoning is an exemplification 
or in other words on which it proceeds 

besides the doctrine that reasoning is one and 
the same process in all cases or as a part or sequel 
of the doctrine it is further contended that all 
reasoning may be thrown into the form of three 
propositions that every conclusion is really de 
duced from two other propositions and that the 
syllogism which contains the three exhibits a 
correct analysis or representation of the one 
identical process 

what has been already said in the foregoing 
chapters supplies in some measure a refutation 
of the substantial portion of these assertions but it 
may be useful to enter into a more minute con 
sideration of the errors comprised in them 

with regard to the forms in which reasoning 
may be exhibited it has been shown in the two 
last chapters that what i have ventured to term 
direct contingent reasoning may be expressed in 
two ways or rather assumes two different forms 

the type of one is 

 thus in the port royal logic it is said “ no enthymeme 
is conclusive save in virtue of a proposition understood which 
consequently ought to be in the mind though it be not ex 
pressed” part iii chap ix 


 


forms of reasoning 


 


all men as far as observation has extended 
have been fallible 

therefore this man whose fallibility has not 
been matter of observation is fallible 

the type of the other is 

all men as far as observation has extended 
have been fallible 

therefore all men are fallible 

in reasoning of this description the strict de 
monstrative syllogism can obviously have no place 

we may indeed vary the first type by in 
troducing a minor premise and thus throw the 
argument into three propositions but we should 
in this way obtain only a quasisyllogism not a 
real or demonstrative one in the case of the 
second type even this is impracticable although 
even here we may construct a somewhat different 
quasisyllogism by generalising the argument into 
“ what all men have been all men are” and in 
troducing the general proposition or maxim so 
created as a major premise a procedure which as 
i have already shown in part and shall hereafter 
show more fully is vain and nugatory 

when indeed we have once legitimately in 
ferred a general law and employ it as a major 
premise from which to deduce particular inferences 
contingent reasoning falls into classreasoning and 
becomes in form demonstrative without however 
acquiring any additional force from its new shape 

the assertion then above quoted that all reason 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


ing may be thrown into syllogisms is not true of 
direct contingent reasoning 

we turn then to demonstrative reasoning and 
inquire whether this is all syllogistic whether 
every conclusion in demonstrative reasoning is 
really deduced from two other propositions called 
respectively the major and the minor premise and 
whether consequently the syllogism can be re 
garded as a true analysis or correct representation 
of the process in every instance 

when it is affirmed that every conclusion is 
really deduced from two other propositions the 
assertion if it means any thing must mean either 
that when any person draws an inference he has 
two other propositions in his mind or that two 
other propositions are requisite to make the infer 
ence valid but for my own part i find myself 
continually drawing inferences from facts which 
if expressed in language at all may be fully ex 
pressed in a single proposition and i am not 
able to discover that such inferences can be ren 
dered more valid by adding another proposition 
to it it will not i think be difficult to show 
that in two distinct cases we have in our minds 
only one fact or one set of facts expressible in a 
single proposition on which the inference depends 
that in the one case there is nothing in the mind 
corresponding to the minor premise of a syllogism 
and in the other nothing corresponding to the 
major premise and that in both cases the single 
premise suffices for the validity of the conclusion

hence if there were no other objections to the 
doctrine the syllogism could not be regarded as a 
correct representation or analysis of every intel 
lectual process termed reasoning 

in regard to the first point it will not require 
much skill to show that what is termed the minor 
premise is so far from being essentially necessary 
to a perfect process of reasoning that in certain 
cases it cannot be forced into the verbal expres 
sion or representation of that process without 
puerility or supererogation and when it is thus 
forcibly introduced it adds no strength to the con 
clusion and there is really nothing in the process 
to which it corresponds 

let us take a familiar instance before employed 
a naturalist finds the remains of a horned quad 
ruped and pronounces that it was a ruminant 
animal the reasoning here if considered as class 
reasoning is perfectly expressed by a single pre 
mise with the conclusion 

all horned quadrupeds are ruminant 

therefore this horned quadruped was rumi 
nant 

a logician may say “ yes but you here com 
prise in the conclusion two facts or propositions 
and when these are separated you obtain a regular 
syllogism 

all horned quadrupeds are ruminant 

this quadruped had horns 

therefore it was ruminant” 

g 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


the introduction of a separate proposition never 
theless is obviously forced it adds no strength 
to the inference and represents no separate mental 
operation the naturalist sees before him at a 
glance the remains of a horned quadruped and 
he believes it to have been ruminant because he 
knows that these attributes have been always 
found conjoined in relation to the fact before his 
eyes this knowledge enables him to draw an im 
mediate inference you may say that it is a com 
pound fact and you may decompose it into the 
two facts of the animal having four legs and having 
two horns and then contend that these were 
joined together by a distinct mental act corre 
sponding to the minor premise but all this is 
pure invention of what no one is conscious of as 
will be manifest if we strip the instance of some 
of its accessories suppose the naturalist to find 
only the horns and to infer that the animal they 
belonged to was ruminant the whole of what 
passed in his mind would be represented in two 
propositions “ all animals having such horns as 
these are ruminant therefore the animal to 
which these horns belonged was ruminant” 

if you attempt to introduce a minor premise 
you fall into the identical proposition “ the 
animal to which these horns belonged had such 
horns” or take the trite argument that peter is 
fallible because he is a man and all men are fallible

the following enthymeme is surely as cogent and 
complete 

this man is fallible 
because all men are fallible 

in order to make this into a syllogism you must 
again resort to a mere identical proposition 

all men are fallible 

this man is a man 

therefore this man is fallible 

in what way can such an excrescence as the 
minor premise here lend any force or clearness to 
the inference or be considered an indispensable 
step it seems to me indeed strange and almost 
ludicrous to maintain that you cannot draw an 
inference from the visible or notorious qualities of 
an object without a separate mental act silently 
pronouncing that such qualities do really belong to 
the object that in the example cited you are not 
capable of concluding the man before you to be 
fallible until you have passed through the intel 
lectual operation if it can be so called represented 
by the identical proposition “ this man is a man ” 
or until the discovery that his name is peter has 
relieved you from the awkwardness of exemplifying 
the literal formula a — a 

 it is obvious that the minor premise is needless 
or supererogatory when the subject of the con 
clusion manifestly belongs to the class of which 
something is predicated in the major the sole 
office of the minor in syllogisms of this form is to 

o 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


declare the subject of it to be one of the class and 
when that circumstance is already as evident as it 
can be such a declaration is not only superfluous 
but impertinent 

it may be remarked too that the enthymeme 
above cited fully corresponds to the dictum de omni 
et nullo “ what is predicated of a whole class may 
be predicated of any individual contained under it” 
the universal principle of reasoning as it has been 
called forgets the minor premise and is perfectly 
exemplified by enthymemes which omit it the 
argument “ fallibility may be predicated of all 
men therefore it may be predicated of this man” 
is a complete exemplification of the dictum even 
all classreasoning then is not syllogistic 

in regard to the second point which i have un 
dertaken to establish and which is of much greater 
importance than the other a brief exposition only 
repeating indeed what has been said before 
will suffice to show that a perfect piece of reason 
ing may consist of what is usually called the minor 
premise with the conclusion and without any 
major premise this is true of certain cases of 
demonstrative reasoning as explained in the pre 
ceding chapter take once more the simple 
instance the lines a and b are equal to each 
other for they are severally equal to c 

here the reasoning is complete you may 
indeed form a general proposition and make it 
into a major premise as was shown in the chapter 


 



forms of reasoning 


 


just referred to you may enunciate that things 
equal to the same thing are equal to each other 
a and b are equal to the same thing c therefore 
they are equal to each other 

this general proposition however is psycholo 
gically an afterthought it may not enter the 
mind at all and what is most important it adds 
nothing to the force of the argument the reasoner 
discerns the truth of the conclusion from the parti 
cular fact expressed in what is termed the minor 
premise and after so discerning it may or may 
not proceed to discern that the assertion will hold 
good in all cases the latter is as already ex 
plained the general principle exemplified by the 
argument or educed from it and cannot constitute 
a part of it 

the procedure of the mind would in truth be 
more accurately represented as follows than in the 
syllogism above cited 

a and b are respectively equal to c 

therefore they are equal to each other 

and it is also manifest that a similar con 
 elusion may be drawn as to the mutual 
equality of all things which are equal to the 
same thing 

 this point is forcibly urged in the sequel to sematology 
p by mr smart whose writings abound with acute and 
often just observations on logic beyond those of most living 
authors i may be permitted however to add that in some of his 
views and modes of representing logical subjects i am not able 
to concur

the theory oe reasoning 


thus there is an extensive set of cases of de 
monstrative reasoning which do not come under 
the head of classreasoning and which find a 
perfect expression in the shape of enthymemes 
to attempt to force them into the syllogistic form 
is to mistake their character and the circumstances 
on which their cogency depends it is surprising 
that geometrical reasoning should ever have been 
considered as altogether syllogistic when fully 
spread out for although all its steps are suscep 
tible of being thrown into that form it can be 
done in the case of many of them only by the in 
troduction of selfevident axioms of which they 
are perfectly independent for their force and 
which are consequently a useless appendage 

i have borrowed my illustration from mathe 
matical reasoning but the same superfluous or 
excrescent character of the major premise may be 
observed in certain cases of reasoning on moral 
and physical subjects revert in proof of this to 
the instances of demonstrative reasoning cited in 
the third chapter one of them will suffice here 
for illustration “ the planets are opaque bodies 
therefore they must shine by light derived from 
an external source” it is obvious that a propo 
sition affirming that all opaque bodies shine by 
light derived from external sources would be 
merely generalising an argument sufficiently con 
clusive and would not add to it a particle of 
cogency 


 



forms of reasoning 


 


the class of demonstrative inferences before 
pointed out in which the premise and the conclu 
sion differ only in presenting the same fact under 
two several aspects likewise require no major 
proposition as “ this man is enslaved by his 
appetites therefore he is not free ” where the 
reasoning which appears puerile enough already 
would be rendered still more so by prefixing the 
general assertion “no man who is enslaved by 
his appetites is free” 

the same may be said of those inferences which 
take place in the conversion of propositions e g 
no man is infallible 

therefore no infallible being is a man 

in a former chapter i remarked that all in 
stances of conversion are really instances of de 
monstrative reasoning being pure enthymemes 
which require no major premises that the 
latter may be supplied and that when supplied 
they are perfectly inefficient in adding strength to 
the argument and therefore wholly superfluous 
may be easily shown 

let us try this experiment on the instance of 
conversion just cited it may be transformed into 
the following syllogism 

when a class are excluded from an attribute 
all beings who possess that attribute are 
excluded from the class 

 this is however an actual syllogism given in the elements 
of logic 

o 


 



 


the theoby of reasoning 


the class “ men ” are excluded from the at 
tribute of infallibility 

therefore all beings who possess infallibility 
are excluded from the class “ men” 

here it is manifest that nothing is gained but a 
mass of verbiage by the introduction of a major 
premise the enthymeme is equally cogent and 
more readily seen to be so 

to elucidate the subject still further let us take 
another demonstrative enthymeme 

the world exhibits marks of design 

therefore it is the work of an intelligent 
author 

this argument so expressed is an example of 
necessary implication as much as if any one were 
to say “ this is a thought therefore it must have 
proceeded from a thinker” in order to make it 
into a syllogism we must prefix the general pro 
position “ whatever exhibits marks of design 
has had an intelligent author” but if any one 
does not discern the conclusion to be implied in 
the minor premise he will not be convinced by the 
addition of the major which can lend no force 
to the argument being merely a generalisation 
of it 

the instances which i have hitherto adduced 
all exhibit selfevident implication of one thing by 
another but there are cases in which the asserted 
implication is not selfevident and yet the reason 


 



forms of reasoning 


 


ing can gain no force from its being taken out of 
the form of an enthymeme 

suppose any logician to assert that “ solon was 
a wise legislator” and on inquiring into the reason 
of his assertion he answered “ because he adapted 
his laws to the genius of the people” if i were 
not satisfied with this reason and pushed my 
questioning further “ why do you consider him 
as a wise legislator for doing this ” he as a 
logician might reply “ all legislators who do this 
are ¦wise” such a reply nevertheless would leave 
me just as i was the reasoning indeed would 
be rounded into a perfect syllogism the major 
premise would be supplied and if admitted at the 
outset the conclusion must be admitted with it 
but starting from the conclusion as a proposition 
to be proved i should be no more satisfied than i 
was before if i were not convinced that solon 
proved himself a wise legislator by adapting his 
laws to the genius of the people i should not be 
satisfied by the major proposition and if i were 
convinced the major proposition would be need 
less for the same reason in both cases namely 
that it would be nothing more than a generalisa 
tion of the particular argument 

it is not that such reasoning is selfevident and 
the denial of its validity involves a contradiction 
but that to generalise it into a major proposition 
does not add to its force if you wish to strengthen 
it you must find something different from a major 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


premise as for example “for when laws are 
adapted to the genius of the people they are cheer 
fully obeyed” 

in reference to such cases it is to be considered 
that to discern one fact to be implied in another 
requires a certain degree of knowledge where 
the subjects of the reasoning are simple and the 
necessary knowledge is a common possession the 
implication appears at once self evident as in 
geometry which is concerned exclusively with 
lines and angles but where the subjects of the 
reasoning are complex one fact may be really 
implied in another although the implication is not 
discernible without considerable knowledge and 
study whether the implication however is im 
mediately selfevident or not a general proposition 
in the form of a major premise is alike inoperative 
as a proof it could be obtained only by general 
ising the particular argument and general propo 
sitions so obtained are wholly inefficient and su 
pererogatory in establishing the conclusion when 
on the other hand they are obtained by collecting 
facts or are the result of previous deduction they 
are as remarked in the last chapter essentially 
necessary to the inference 

if we compare the instances last adduced with a 
syllogism or enthymeme which has for its major or 
only premise either a collective fact respecting a 
class of objects or a law of nature deduced from 
such a fact we shall find that in the latter case

the force of the argument is wholly dependent on 
the general proposition or on the collective fact 
from which it has been deduced 

as an example the old wellworn syllogism 
before cited will do as well as any other 

all men are mortal 

peter is a man 

therefore he is mortal 

here the allegation that peter is a man would 
constitute no sufficient ground for concluding him 
to be mortal it merely brings him within the 
general fact or law which is the real reason it 
is the latter that makes the argument good the 
minor premise would be of noneffect without it 

but in the case of the enthymemes and more con 
spicuously the mathematical demonstration before 
cited the minor or rather the only premise suffices 
of itself and can borrow no strength as a reason 
from the addition of the major which being a 
mere generalisation of the argument after its co 
gency must have been seen would be more properly 
termed a corollary than a premise 

to sum up in reverse order what has been said 
of the forms of demonstrative reasoning — 

 in reference to the same argument the author of semato 
logy observes “in this instance the axiom which forms the 
major proposition is superfluous it is not an inductive whole 
like “ man is mortal” from which we deduce the more parti 
cular comprehended in it but the particular suppose it to occur 
to the mind for the first time is as certainly understood to be 
true as if it came after millions of instances ” — sequel to 
sematology p 


 



 


tie theoky of reasoning 


in arguments where a particular fact implies 
another fact or to express it differently where 
what is usually called the minor premise implies the 
conclusion a general proposition or major premise 
is redundant and such reasoning so far from being 
syllogistic cannot even be considered as class 
reasoning at all or as in anywise exemplifying 
the dictum de omni et nullo or other allied dicta 
of these acts of reasoning the geometrical enthy 
meme is the best type 

on the other hand where the major premise or 
a general proposition implies the conclusion a 
minor premise is sometimes needful and sometimes 
superfluous — needful when the subject of the 
conclusion does not manifestly belong to the class 
designated by the middle term or spoken of in the 
major premise superfluous when it manifestly 
does 

all such reasoning whether with or without a 
minor premise exemplifies the scholastic dictum 
or other dicta allied to it 

we are thus brought to the conclusion that in 
numerous cases of demonstrative reasoning one 
premise is alone suificient for the inference although 
it may be granted that even in those cases it is 
possible to form a complete syllogism by thrusting 
in a fruitless and redundant proposition 

it follows also from what has been said that it 
is inappropriate and incorrect to call the syllogism 
an analysis of the process of all demonstrative 


 


forms of reasoning 


 


reasoning and much more so to apply the assertion 
to all reasoning whatever 

an analysis of reasoning ought to be an account 
of what takes place in the mind when it draws an 
inference or is determined to a conclusion now 
from the preceding representations it is manifest 
that a single fact or combination of facts capable 
of being expressed in one proposition frequently 
determines the mind to a conclusion without re 
ference to any thing else this is the whole of 
which the mind is conscious or which can be dis 
cerned as having taken place on reflection 

supplying in such cases the missing premise as 
it is called when it is not introducing a mere 
identical assertion is simply stating a certain pro 
position which may be enunciated with truth if 
the argument is valid but which neither forms nor 
represents any part of the mental process to 
contend that a second premise is necessary to the 
completion of an argument because it may by 
some expedient or other always be added to it is 
like contending that a shawl is an indispensable 
part of a lady’s dress because it may always be 
thrown over every thing else in which she may 
be attired 

this introduction of two premises is in many 
arguments proper and needful but in some it is 
mere impertinence or supererogation and in others 
nothing more than the obtrusion of identical 
propositions

primary or original premises 

the preceding chapters have endeavoured to show 
amongst other things that what are termed prin 
ciples of reasoning or maxims give no force to 
arguments they do not constitute real premises 
in any case and cannot therefore be the original 
premises from which we set out 

what then it may be asked are the primary 
propositions with which our reasonings commence 

to this inquiry it may be at once replied that 
with the exceptions to be hereafter named we 
always commence with particular facts or to 
express it more precisely that particular facts or 
propositions expressive of them are in every case 
taking into view the whole train of reasoning from 
beginning to end the first premises from which we 
start and the ultimate ground at which in tracing 
back our reasonings we invariably arrive 

it has been said indeed in contrariety to this 
that all our reasonings about events if traced back 
to their origin will be found to rest on the maxim 
or general principle as a major premise that 
similar causes produce similar effects and that all 
our reasonings in mathematics rest in the same way 
on the several axioms of that science 


 



primary or original premises 


 


but as i have already shown these general 
principles and axioms are educed from particular 
arguments or instances of implication and if this 
is true they cannot precede such arguments nor 
constitute the original premises from which any 
conclusions are inferred 

nor can those general propositions which really 
form constituent parts of our reasonings be the ori 
ginal premises inquired for 

in contingent reasoning as already explained it 
is from particular facts that we form or infer a 
general law and although we may subsequently 
use the general law as a premise from which to 
deduce particular conclusions the whole reasoning 
rests on the first facts and the general law is only 
an intermediate proposition 

in demonstrative reasoning the same position is 
equally true at the outset it is always in one or 
more particular facts that we discern another parti 
cular fact to be implied and it is from such par 
ticular implications that we form those general 
propositions which we use in subsequent deductions 
from discerning an implication in one instance 
we discern that it must have place in all like in 
stances hence neither axioms nor general laws 
obtained by contingent reasoning nor general pro 
positions employed in demonstrative reasoning can 
be primary or original premises 

i am here speaking on the supposition of the 
whole of a train of reasoning being gone through 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


by the same mind or to state the matter differently 
i am speaking as if the whole race of thinkers 
constituted one individual 

practically we take general propositions or laws 
from various sources without going back to their 
origin — from authority or testimony or hypo 
thesis — and reason from them without hesitation 
and if such propositions are furnished to us from a 
source beyond which we cannot ascend as for ex 
ample by revelation from a superior intelligence 
they are to mankind original major premises and 
form exceptions to the doctrine that we always 
commence with particular facts 

every man indeed is in a position analogous to 
this with regard to general laws on subjects which 
he has not himself investigated inasmuch as his 
want of knowledge precludes him from ascending 
to the primary facts from which they are inferred 

another source of general propositions not ob 
tained from particular facts and serving as original 
major premises is to be found in civil laws com 
mands directions and rules of conduct generally 
this is a most extensive source of premises from 
which we deduce conclusions in practical life and 
although it has obviously nothing to do with the 
acquisition of science the reasoning is precisely on 
a level with that in which the premises are obtained 
by what logicians term complete enumeration or 
by geometrical inference 

“ if” says mr stewart “ there are any parts of 


 



primary or original premises 


 


science in which the syllogism can be advantage 
ously applied it must be those where our judg 
ments are formed in consequence of an application 
to particular cases of certain maxims general 
propositions which we are not at liberty to dis 
pute an example of this occurs in the practice 
of law here the particular conclusion must be 
regulated by the general principle whether right 
or wrong the case was similar in every branch 
of philosophy as long as the authority of great 
names prevailed and the old scholastic maxims 
were allowed without examination to pass as in 
controvertible truths” 

the doctrine which so long predominated and 
which still continues to be held by philosophers at 
large that all our reasonings must be founded on 
general principles or propositions or in other 
words that all our conclusions may be traced back 

 elements of philosophy vol ii p this case of 
general propositions being sometimes given to us forming an 
exception to the doctrine that the original premises in our 
reasonings are particular facts has also been well explained by 
mr john mill in his system of logic vol i mr smart 
expresses the general doctrine of this chapter with clearness 
and precision after remarking that in tracing back our in 
ferences we must come at last to something not an inference 
he continues “now this ultimate ground can consist of 
nothing but particular or individual truths for which we 
have the evidence of our senses or our consciousness” — prac

different connection observes that “the immediate object of all 
our reason and knowledge is nothing but particulars” — essay

chap ix 

the relation between reasoning and language 

as all the acts of reasoning which men communi 
cate to each other and even many of those which 
are confined to their own breasts are put into 
words language cannot but stand in a very import 
ant relation to the reasoning process so intimate 
indeed is the connection between them that many 
logicians have maintained the impossibility of 
reasoning without words 

although this is a doctrine which is obviously 
at variance with the whole tenour of the preceding 
views and virtually refuted by some of the par 
ticular arguments employed to enforce them yet 
from its extensive prevalence it seems to require a 
distinct examination and this examination will 
probably bring out the true relation in which the 
two things before us stand to each other the 
following is one of the most recent statements of 
the logical doctrine on the subject 

“ logic is entirely conversant about language” 
or “ is wholly concerned in the use of language” 
accordingly a syllogism is “ an argument so ex 
pressed that the conclusiveness of it is manifest 

h 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


from the mere force of the expression i e without 
considering the meaning of the terms” 

this doctrine if we take its superficial import 
seems to narrow the province of logic to only one 
kind of argumentation by representing it as em 
bracing only such reasoning as is carried on in 
words it appears at first sight to be founded on 
a distinction between employing language in rea 
soning and reasoning without language and to 
restrict logic to the consideration of the former 
unexpressed reasoning tacit deduction which 
takes place independently of language is not 
arcording to this representation within the domain 
of the science 

in this case it would be necessary either to pass 
over the latter sort of inference altogether or to 
treat it as something separate and distinct but as 
reasoning whether expressed in language or not 
is really about things such a distinction would be 
at the best illusory 

if the expressions however containing the doc 
trine are looked at more closely they will be 
found to imply a much more important proposition 


 the expressions between quotation marks are the words of 
dr whately in his elements of logic p st ed 
dugald stewart in his zeal for nominalism had previously given 
his sanction to the same view see elements of philosophy 
vol i p vo ed in a subsequent passage how 
ever mr stewart qualifies the doctrine as will be hereafter ex 
plained 


 


reasoning and language 


 


viz that there is no reasoning except in words 
they virtually declare the process to be impossible 
without language and moreover to be so much 
an affair of mere words that we can reason without 
attaching any meaning to the terms employed 

let us examine these two extraordinary po 
sitions 

that the various operations of the mind are 
concerned with facts or things has been already 
shown and it is plain that we may think of facts 
and things — we may recollect conceive or imagine 
them without the intervention of signs nor is 
language more necessary to the mental act called 
reasoning than it is to the operations called 
memory conception and imagination all the 
help which it affords in this process is enabling 
the mind to recall and keep in view the facts repre 
sented by the signs employed 

the possibility of reasoning in geometry without 
words cannot i think be doubted by any one 
who attends to the movements of his own mind 

 even hobbes who has been styled plusqucim nominalis 
and who seems in many passages of his writings to regard 
reasoning like truth as an affair of mere words now and then 
admits that we may carry on the process without them he 
says “ quomodo autem animo sine verbis tacita cogitatione 
ratiocinando addere et subtrahere solemus uno aut altero ex 
emplo ostendendum cst” “but how by the ratiocination of 
our mind we add and subtract in our silent thoughts without the 
use of words it will be necessary for me to make intelligible by 
an example or two” — logic chap i § see also leviathan 
chap v 

ii 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


in tracing the proofs that the three angles of a 
triangle are equal to two right angles i can for 
my own part easily follow the steps of the demon 
stration without thinking about the language i 
am led to discern intuitively the equality of cer 
tain angles to other angles until i arrive at the 
conclusion a discernment which has not the 
slightest concern with words as i can go through 
the whole deduction without even attaching names 
or letters to the angles 

so in contingent reasoning or drawing conclu 
sions about events a great part of our reasoning 
consists in inferring the future from the past the 
absent from the present the unknown past from 
the known past in all these cases what tve think 
about are facts we represent to ourselves the 
objects and events of which we have had knowledge 
or experience and the future events which from a 
review of these we think will happen or the un 
observed past events which we conclude have 
happened language may mingle in these opera 
tions but it is neither essential to them nor forms 
their principal feature it may mix itself with our 

 hobbes acknowledges the possibility of this he says a man 
that hath no use of speech at all such as is born and remains 
perfectly deaf and dumb if he set before his eyes a triangle 
and by it two right angles such as are the corners of a square 
figure he may by meditation compare and find that the three 
angles of that triangle are equal to those two right angles that 
stand by it” — leviathan part i chap iv 


 


reasoning and language 


 


reasonings as it does with our recollections and 
imaginings without at all affecting their substan 
tial character 

it is indeed an extraordinary mistake to sup 
pose that we reason only when we clothe our 
thoughts in words or deduce our conclusions in 
verbal propositions it surely requires little re 
flection to be aware that we every day make a 
thousand inferences with the rapidity of lightning 
without the possibility of the intermediation of 
language so far indeed are we from being 
obliged to reason in words that i will venture to 
appeal to the consciousness of the reader whether 
¦we do not oftener reason without them while 
performing our commonest actions we are per 
petually making inferences and cannot avoid it 
in taking a walk for instance in choosing this 
road in avoiding that obstacle in mounting a 
style or in opening a gate we are constantly con 
cluding beforehand what results will follow certain 
acts without putting these anticipations into lan 
guage what rapid inferences are drawn by a 
popular orator who is making a speech to a way 
avard assembly and has to adapt his matter and 
his expressions as he proceeds to the state of 

 “ to suppose” says dr brown “ that we cannot reason 
without language seems to me indeed almost to involve the 
same inconsistency as to say that man is incapable of moving 
his limbs till he have previously walked a mile” — lectures on 
the human mind vol ii p 


 


tub theory of reasoning 


feeling which manifests itself to his observation 
he shuns one topic which he intended to introduce 
because he becomes aware that it will be illre 
ceived and he introduces another not premedi 
tated because his tact enables him to foresee that 
it will make a favourable impression and this 
instance is the more remarkable as an illustration 
of the view here taken because a double process 
of reasoning is at one and the same time taking 
place in the mind the orator not only reasons 
in words to his audience but is conscious of a 
rapid series of tacit inferences going on within 
him as to what topics it will be proper to avoid 
or profitable to touch upon as he proceeds 

in some passages of his writings dugald stewart 
quitting for a while the pure logical doctrine takes 
a view of the subject similar to that here given 
“we can employ” he says in one place “the 
agency of air to increase the heat of a furnace the 
furnace to render iron malleable and we can 
apply the iron to all the various purposes of the 
mechanical arts now it appears to me that all 
this may be conceived and done without the aid 
of language and yet assuredly to discover a series 
of means subservient to a particular end or in 
other words an effort of mechanical invention 
implies according to the common doctrines of 
philosophers the exercise of our reasoning powers 
in this sense therefore of the word reasoning i 
am inclined to think that it is not essentially con

nected with the faculty of generalisation nor with 
the use of signs” 

but mr stewart it must be observed terms all 
this particular reasoning he allows with hobbes 
that particular reasoning may take place without 
words but general reasoning he affirms and 
here he again falls in with the logical doctrine 
cannot take place except in words 

he goes even to the extreme nominalism of 
asserting that without the use of signs all our 
thoughts must have related to individuals for 
getting that since a sign must signify something 
if we could think only of individuals signs of 
individuals would be the only signs that could 
be invented discerning or thinking of a class 
i e a number of individuals resembling each other 
in one or more respects must precede the act of 
naming a class otherwise we should be giving a 
name to nothing 

the example which mr stewart himself adduces 
is sufficient to show the error of his doctrine 

if a man reasons without language when he 
employs the agency of air to increase the heat of 
a furnace which he may do although completely 
deaf and dumb he has already generalised when 
he has sent one blast of air into his fire he sends 
another after it in the full assurance that he can

produce the same effect whenever he chooses and 
he infers with as little doubt that his neighbour 
who is building another furnace will find currents 
of air equally efficient 

if this is not generalising and general reasoning 
what is it may possibly be alleged however 
although incorrectly that what i have hitherto 
advanced cannot be applied to syllogistic reasoning 
let us consider then a case expressly of this de 
scription let us suppose our deaf and dumb 
man to be something of a botanist and to be 
taking a country walk he comes to a bank on 
which are growing a number of primroses and on 
examining the flowers he perceives as he has 
always perceived in similar examinations that 
each flower contains five filaments or stamens

• condillac has been classed amongst those who have con 
sidered language as indispensable to reasoning and he un 
doubtedly asserts that the art of reasoning resolves itself into a 
well constructed language “l’artde raisonner sereduit a une 
langue bien faite” or “it l’art de bien parler ” — la logique 
partie ii chap v and in another part of the same treatise he 
tells us “ que les mots nous sont absolument necessaires por 
nous faire des idees de toutes especes et nous verrons bientot 
que les idees abstraites et generates ne sont que des denomina 
tions tout confirmera done que nous ne pensons qu’avec le 
secours des mots — partie ii chap v the last doctrine 
goes even beyond that of mr stewart there are however 
other passages in the same treatise not easy to reconcile with 
those i have quoted see partie i chap vii and partie ii 
chap i i so difficult is it to be consistent in error

rose growing on an inaccessible ledge halfway 
down a perpendicular rock and “ not to be come 
at by the willing hand” although inspection of 
the flower is precluded reasoning about it is not 
and he immediately infers that it has five stamens 
in its corolla like all which he has examined in 
this case he would think and infer without the 
slightest aid from language just what a syllogism 
expresses surely the power of attaching the 
generic name of primrose to the flower could not 
possibly make it a clearer act of reasoning 

we have next to consider the assertion that the 
conclusiveness of an argument may be manifest 
from the mere force of the expression without 
considering the meaning of its terms 

to employ language in reasoning without at 
taching some meaning to the signs employed 
seems to me i confess a sheer impossibility and 
‘‘there is to my understanding a marvellous incon 
sistency in saying that the conclusiveness of an 
argument may be manifest from the mere force of 
the expression without considering the meaning of 
the terms expression can have no force but from 
its meaning language in so far as it has no 
meaning has no strength it is a mere noise a 
nullity 

the writers who thus maintain that the con 
clusiveness of a properly expressed argument is 
manifest without considering the meaning of the 
terms exemplify their doctrine as follows — “in 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


this syllogism r is x z is y therefore z is x the 
conclusion is inevitable whatever terms x y z re 
spectively are understood to stand for” here is 
an admission at all events that they must stand 
for something and it is precisely what they stand 
for that constitutes their meaning and that gives 
force and even intelligibility to the argument if 
the letters are to be considered as mere letters 
without representative power or symbolical signi 
ficance each proposition of the syllogism is false 
the letter y is not the letter x nor is the letter z 
the letter y we must then of necessity consider 
the representative meaning y must be taken to 
designate some thing or things and not to stand 
as a mere letter x must be taken to designate 
some attribute of y and z must be taken as 
meaning y or as a particular name for a thing also 
called y the conclusion asserts that z must there 
fore have the attribute belonging to the thing or 
things called y 

here then it is manifest that the meaning is 
everything to the argument the letters are 
merely helps 

that a variety of things and attributes may be 
attached to the symbols x y z without altering 
the force of the argument is a circumstance be 
longing to the nature of general language an 
analogous fact in arithmetic is familiar to every 
one twice ten are equal to twenty whether the 
subject of the calculation happens to be shillings 


 



reasoning and language 


 


or pounds or men or marbles but it cannot be 
affirmed that on this account the words twice ten 
are twenty are destitute of meaning or that their 
meaning is left out of consideration 

the whole truth of the matter in question and 
this may have been all which the passage under 
review so incautiously worded was intended to 
express is that we may reason with terms how 
ever general may be their signification under the 
condition of course that they have some significa 
tion to reason about 

it is worth while in further elucidation of the 
subject to quote the following paradox as mr 
hallam justly terms it thrown out by hobbes in 
his correspondence with descartes for the sake of 
the reply given by the latter coinciding so exactly 
as it does with the views advanced in the present 
treatise 

 mr r e scott in his able work entitled “ elements of 
intellectual philosophy” gives some acute comments on the 
passage already referred to in dugald stewart’s first volume in 
which that philosopher asserts that in order to perceive the 
justness of the inference in a syllogism like that quoted above 
it is not necessary to understand its meaning “ though i by 
no means admit” says mr scott “ that it is not necessary to 
understand the meaning of a syllogism in order to perceive the 
justness of its inference yet without doubt our assent will be 
given to a syllogism although its terms be successively varied 
according to a certain principle” he afterwards adds that a 
syllogism “ whose minor is z is an x will never enforce our 
assent unless we settle by previous definition that x denotes 
a genus or species of which z is an individual” p 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


“ que dironsnous maintenant” writes hobbes 
“si peutetre le raisonnement n’est rien autre 
chose qu’un assemblage et un enchainement de 
noms par ce mot est d’oii il s’ensuivroit que par 
la raison nous ne concluons rien de tout touchant 
la nature des choscs mais seulemeut touchant leurs 
appellations c’estadire que par elle nous voyons 
simplement si nous assemblons bien ou mal les 
noms des choses selon les conventions que nous 
avons faites a notre fantaisie touchant leurs signi 
fications” 

to this curious passage descartes very aptly 
replied — 

“ l’assemblage qui se fait dans le raisonnement 
n’est pas celui des noms mais bien celui des choses 
signifies par les noms et je m’dtonne que le con 
traire puisse venir en l’esprit de personne” 

in reasoning on some subjects little progress 
indeed could be made without language it is not 
always seen however that this observation is ap 
plicable far more to written than to spoken lan 
guage to visible symbols than to articulate sounds 
yet no one would dream of attempting on this 
account to restrict logic to written language

reasoning and induction 


 


chap x 

the relation of observation experiment and 
induction to reasoning and to each other 

the terras at the head of the present chapter denote 
closely allied and frequently intermingled opera 
tions which it seems desirable to investigate in 
order to show in what relation they stand to each 
other and more particularly in what relation 
reasoning stands to the rest 

experiment is usually placed in antithesis to 
observation as if one excluded the other but 
surely the intellectual act termed observation is 
just as much required for experiments as it is for 
spontaneous events unless experiments are ob 
served they can clearly be of no use it is equally 
true if not equally clear that the observation of 
either spontaneous or experimental phenomena can 
scarcely take place without reasoning and if it 
could would be of no scientific value 

to illustrate this by an example we observe a 
stone fall rapidly to the ground and a featheri 
floating in the atmosphere slowly descend me 
ditating on these events we conjecture or infer 
that the air through which they fall has something 
to do with the difference in the rates of their 
descent we in consequence devise the experi

ment in which also reasoning is needful of 
placing the two substances in a vessel exhausted 
of air and we find that on precipitating them 
from the same height they come to the bottom of 
the vessel at the same moment we try other 
substances with a similar result and finally deduce 
the general law that all substances at the surface 
of the earth descend in vacuo from equal heights in 
equal times 

there is evidently here in the first place ob 
servation of facts spontaneously occurring then 
reasoning or conjecturing something from those 
facts viz what would result from withdraw 
ing the element of air further reasoning as to the 
mode of withdrawing it acting on this reasoning 
by trying the experiment subsequently making 
other experiments and finally deducing a general 
conclusion or law 

but not only have we here observation of spon 
taneous and experimental phenomena with an in 
termixture of reasoning but we have in those 
combined operations an example of what is usually 
termed induction induction is not some process 
superadded to those here described but it is in 
this instance a combination of the two intellectual 
operations of observing and inferring with the 
mechanical aid of experimental contrivances to 
enlarge their range and for the purpose of de 
ducing a general law 

it thus appears that instead of contrasting ob 


digilized by googi 



reasoning and induction 


 


servation and experiment we should contrast spon 
taneous and experimental phenomena as alike sub 
jects of observation facts furnished by artificial 
contrivances require to be observed just in the 
same way as those which are presented by nature 
without our interference and yet philosophers 
are nearly unanimous in confining observation to 
the latter phenomena and speaking of it as of 
something which ceases where experiment begins 
while in simple truth the business of experiment 
is to extend the sphere of observation and not 
to take up a subject where observation lays it 
down 

in regard to induction the view which i have 
here taken of it coincides if i mistake not with 
that which is to be found in the writings of our 
most eminent philosophers from lord bacon to 
dr brown 

by logical writers it has indeed been used in a 
much more limited sense viz that of inferring a 
general conclusion from either a complete or an 
imperfect enumeration of particular instances

plurium singularium recensione aliquid universale conclu

the theory of reasoning 


and even some philosophical writers of the school 
of bacon have employed it in an analogous ac 
ceptation to denote merely the process of inferring 
a conclusion more general than the premises from 
which it is drawn 

if we turn however to the pages of such writers 
as reid stewart and the more metaphysical fol 
lowers of bacon we shall find the term there sig 
nifying the process of obtaining or preparing the 
premises and frequently distinguished from that 
of inferring the conclusion in other words it is 
used to denote that combination of observation and 
reasoning which has been already described as pre 
ceding the final inference 

mr stewart for instance speaks of “those general 
conclusions concerning the established order of the 
universe to which when legitimately inferred from 
an induction sufficiently extensive philosophers have 
metaphorically applied the title of laws of nature” 
where the term induction clearly denotes something 
that precedes the inference and of course does not 
include it 

in a similar way dr brown speaks of “ a wide 
induction” 

“ there is a constant tendency” he says “ in the 
mind to convert a general law into a universal law 
— to suppose after a wide induction that what is 
true of many substances that have a very striking

analogy is as certainly true of all that have this 
striking analogy” 

professor playfair in giving an account of 
bacon’s method teaches that we are to begin by 
excluding certain things from our collection of 
facts “ this exclusion” he continues “ is the 
first part of the process of induction” f 

other writers speak of “ a partial ” and “ an in 
complete ” induction phrases manifestly referring 
to the observation or examination of instances 

in the preceding passages induction is clearly 
regarded as a process of investigation preparatory 
to the formation of a general law 

this process may be more or less complicated 
according to circumstances and includes or may 
include as i have shown observation of both 
spontaneous and experimental phenomena and the 
intermixture of such inferences as may be necessary 
to establish what i have before termed the collective 
fact from which the general law is to be deduced 

it must be allowed nevertheless that there is a 
good deal of laxity in the employment of the word 
even in the writings of our most eminent philo 
sophers lord bacon manifestly uses it to denote 
a mixed process of observation and reasoning but 
he is not altogether exempt from the common want

of precision in applying it and he sometimes in 
cludes under the term the formation or deduction 
of the general law as well as the examination of 
instances newton has i think fallen into an 
ambiguous use of the word in a passage which 
occurs at the conclusion of his “ optics” while the 
extract now presented will furnish an instance in 
point it will exemplify also the manner in which 
observation and experiment are commonly and in 
my view inaccurately distinguished 

“ analysis in natural philosophy consists in 
making experiments and observations and in 
drawing conclusions from them by induction and 
admitting of no objections against the conclusions 
but such as are taken from experiments or other 
certain truths for hypotheses are not to be 
regarded in experimental philosophy and al 
though the arguing from experiments and obser 
vations by induction be no demonstration of general 
conclusions yet it is the best way of arguing which 
the nature of things admits of and may be looked 
upon as so much the stronger by how much the 

 “ inductio enim qu® procedit per enumerationem simplicem 
res puerilis est et precario concludit et periculo exponitur ab 
instantia contradictoria et plerumquc secundum pauciora quam 
par est at ex his tantummodo qu® prasto sunt pronunciat

lib i aph cv 


 



reasoning and induction 


 


induction is more general and if no exception 
occur from phenomena the conclusion may be 
general” 

in the first and second use of the term in this 
passage the intention of the writer was manifestly 
to characterise the drawing of the conclusion al 
though the meaning is not very happily brought 
out since we cannot with propriety speak of draw 
ing conclusions by means of the operation itself or 
of any other operation in the last use of the term 
he evidently meant to characterise the comprehen 
siveness of the preliminary observation 

i have already cited mr stewart as using the 
term induction to denote the course of investigation 
preparatory to the formation of a general law but 
in another passage where he describes the method 
of induction he includes also the final inference 

“ wherever” he says “ an interesting change is 
preceded by a combination of different circum 
stances it is of importance to vary our experiments 
in such a manner as to distinguish what is essential 
from what is accessory and when we have carried 
the decomposition as far as we can we are entitled 
to consider this simplest combination of indispen 
sable conditions as the physical cause of the event 

“ when by thus comparing a number of cases 

 dr johnson gives the greater part of this passage in his 
dictionary to support his second definition of the term bor 
rowed from watts’s logic viz “ induction is when from 
several particular propositions we infer one general’’

 the theory of reasoning 

agreeing in some circumstances but differing in 
others and all attended with the same result a 
philosopher connects as a general law of nature the 
event with its physical cause he is said to proceed 
according to the method of induction this at least 
appears to me to be the idea which in general 
bacon himself annexes to the phrase although i 
will not venture to affirm that he has always em 
ployed it with uniform precision i acknowledge 
also that it is often used by very accurate writers 
to denote the whole of that system of rules of which 
the process just mentioned forms the most essential 
and characteristical part” 

it appears then from the authorities i have cited 
that there are at least three different modes of em 
ploying the term viz to denote 

 the investigation of facts preparatory to the 
formation of a general law 

 the mere inferring of the general law from the 
facts brought together by such investigation 

 the two preceding processes combined 

the first of these acceptations appears to me to 
be the most conformable to the general usage of 
philosophical writers and for that reason the most 
convenient to adopt 

if this discussion should appear to turn on a mere 
question of phraseology it must still be allowed 
that to settle the meaning of so important a word

reasoning and induction 


 


as induction is exceedingly desirable and worth 
some pains at present it may be doubted whether 
any two men of science taken at random and not 
being technical logicians would give the same de 
finition of it 

my principal aim however in the present chapter 
has been in consonance with the subject of my 
treatise to point out how far reasoning is concerned 
in this important combination of intellectual oper 
ations i have accordingly endeavoured to show 
that induction cannot be carried on without a con 
tinual intermixture of inferences with observation 
and that the result to which the whole converges 
is the formation of a general law — itself an act of 
contingent reasoning

chap xi 

rules for guiding the operations of reasoning 
and especially the rules of the scholastic 
logic 

a true theory of the reasoning processes or in 
other words a thorough comprehension of their 
character although fortunately not essential to the 
right performance of the acts may be expected to 
assist us in some degree to arrive at correct con 
clusions but will perhaps be more especially 
serviceable in preventing that misdirection of our 
powers and that waste of attention on wrong ob 
jects which are the usual results of a false theory 
on an important subject 

it must also tend to inspire us with confidence 
in our deductions and with fearlessness in sub 
mitting them to the examination of others in pro 
portion as it enables us to discern the character of 
every link in the chain of argumentation 

whether nevertheless such an insight into 
the nature of the processes will afford any formal 
rules to guide us in the performance of them and 
whether any such rules are needed seem to be 
points not equally clear 

from the preceding exposition of the subject it 


 



rules in reasoning 


 


will have been seen that the operations which pass 
under the name of reasoning are of a simple cha 
racter so simple indeed that a thorough compre 
hension of what they are seems all that is requisite 
to guard us against any irregularity to which they 
may be liable if they are liable to any 

but this is a question which will perhaps be best 
elucidated by a separate examination of it in rela 
tion to each species of reasoning 

section i 

rules in contingent reasoning 

in regard to those acts of contingent reasoning 
from one individual event to another which are 
constantly occurring in the common business of 
life rules can scarcely have place since in them 
we do nothing but infer that some unknown event 
will happen or has happened in certain circum 
stances from our having known a similar event to 
have taken place in similar circumstances if any 
precept is wanted to guard us from mistakes it is 
merely an injunction to take care that our pre 
mises are correct ie that the circumstances are 
similar we may erroneously regard cases as 
resembling each other which really do not a 
fault of observation or a misconception or a mis 
recollection rather than an error of inference 

when however we turn to those important acts 
of contingent reasoning which consist in the in 


 



 


tiie theory of reasoning 


ference of general laws the case is somewhat 
altered in its aspect and the operation seems less 
simple yet still it will be found if i mistake 
not that the greater complexity which then ap 
pears is the complexity of the several operations 
concerned in the preliminary inquiry needful to 
collect and arrange the facts from which the in 
ference is to be drawn 

accordingly if we examine the rules which 
have been laid down by lord bacon and his fol 
lowers we shall find that they are precepts for 
carrying on induction in the sense annexed to 
that term in a former chapter for instituting 
experiments altering the combination of circum 
stances by leaving out some or adding others and 
watching the results which operations are not 
reasoning although reasoning as before explained 
must be or may be employed in conducting them 

they are to be regarded in truth as engaged in 
establishing the collective fact or the premises 
from which inferences to new cases are to be 
drawn or a general law is to be inferred 

when it is stated for example from an ample 
survey of the subject that a certain cause has 
always as far as observation has extended pro 
duced a certain effect this is not an inference or 
conclusion but simply giving the summary result 
of inductive investigation 

when however we expect or predict on a new 
occurrence of the cause that the effect will follow 


 



rules in reasoning 


 


or lay down the general law that the cause always 
produces the effect we do not state a mere matter 
of fact but we draw an inference it is in either 
case an act of direct contingent reasoning 

thus in the formation of a general law as in 
the inference of one particular event from another 
the operation which is solely entitled to the appel 
lation of reasoning is equally simple and the 
question is can so simple a process go wrong and 
the correct performance of it be assisted by rules 

it is undoubted that we constantly witness in 
stances of hasty and undue generalisation or in 
other words of drawing general inferences not 
warranted by the facts from which they are drawn 
and these seem after the strictest analysis to be 
on many occasions at least really errors of rea 
soning 

when a person smarting under the dishonesty 
of some pretended friend who has betrayed him 
for a bribe exclaims “ every man has his price” 
he draws his universal inference from a single case 
and it is immediately seen by others to be a hasty 
and undue generalisation this example indeed 
we may consider in two lights if we regard the 
conclusion it is obviously too wide for the premise 
if we regard the premise it is obviously too scanty 
for the conclusion but in whatever light we 
regard the argument the mistake is in drawing 
the inference not in laying down the premise 
the fact forming the premise viz that a friend 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


has been seduced from his duty by a bribe is the 
only fact by hypothesis before the reasoner and 
if he draw an inference from it at all it should be 
one of something like corresponding extent as 
“ therefore other men in similar circumstances 
may be occasionally expected to act in the same 
way” to deduce a universal conclusion in such a 
case from a single fact is manifestly an error of 
deduction 

the error however of many of these instances 
of unwarranted generalisation lies in the premises 
a part only of the facts have been properly ex 
amined and yet the whole are assumed to have 
been so the premises in these cases as expressed 
or asserted warrant the inference and the erro 
neous conclusion is therefore due to the manner 
in which they are assumed undue generalisation 
results probably oftener from this cause than the 
other and is to be corrected by nothing but stricter 
attention to facts 

even in cases where as in the example above 
cited the fallacy is evidently in the reasoning an 
instructive method of attempting to correct it 
would be trying how far other facts would bear 
out the conclusion endeavouring in a word to 
enlarge the premises rather than to shape the 
conclusion to the dimensions of the single fact 
although the last method of proceeding has also its 
value 

these considerations show that rules for avoiding 


 


rules in reasoning 


 


erroneous conclusions in contingent reasoning are 
in the main rules for the investigation of facts or 
for laying down premises and belong to the general 
art of inductive inquiry 

perhaps the only rule of practical importance to 
guard us against pure errors of inference in these 
cases expressed in general terms is the injunction 
to proportion the extent or generality of the con 
clusion to the facts from which we draw it when 
these facts are susceptible of numerical expression 
the law which we can deduce from them becomes 
susceptible of the same the methods of calcu 
lation in such cases come under a separate science 
usually termed the theory of probabilities which 
is itself an auxiliary of induction and may be 
regarded as an offset or branch of contingent 
reasoning the result of it when its methods are 
well applied is to proportion with all possible 
exactness the law deduced to the facts from which 
it is inferred 


section ii 

rules in demonstrative reasoning and especially 
in classreasoning 

we have next to inquire how far demonstrative 
reasoning may be assisted by rules 

in that branch of it which is not classreasoning 
and of which the mathematical enthymeme may be 
regarded as the type there seems to be no place 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


for rules to guide the process or guard it from 
error that one thing is implied by another is 
discerned at once or if not it can be discerned 
only by acquiring the necessary knowledge to 
discern it 

we cannot however so easily dismiss that va 
riety of demonstrative reasoning which is usually 
termed syllogistic but which for reasons before 
assigned i have denominated classreasoning 
although it is really as simple as the rest and 
requires like them little or no assistance from 
rules but learned men long thought and many 
of them still continue to think otherwise it is 
one of the remarkable circumstances in the in 
tellectual history of the world that between two 
and three thousand years ago this simple process 
of classreasoning was regarded as a matter of 
such great nicety and difficulty that a compli 
cated system of rules was expressly devised to 
prevent mistakes in performing it in subsequent 
ages of unsound philosophy the scholastic logic 
became still further exalted and magnified to an 
undue and even preposterous importance the 
very narrowness of its range appears to have con 
centrated the skill and ingenuity of the human 
mind on the contrivance of an intricate machinery 
to accomplish the little there was to do in this 
limited sphere under the impression that it was 
much and that it w’as absolutely all 

that species or rather that variety of reasoning

which consists in predicating an attribute of some 
individual or individuals of a class because it 
is predicable of all the class or in other allied 
operations seems on a first view to be a very 
simple affair in which it would be difficult to go 
wrong and in which rules would be needless and 
yet we find a most ingenious and elaborate system 
of distinctions maxims and canons constructed 
with no other purpose than to ensure its being 
correctly performed it seems scarcely credible 
when stated in plain terms that the scholastic 
logic with all its formidable apparatus proposes 
to itself as its sole ultimate object to secure the 
correctness and try the validity of the simple 
processes of classreasoning hence this singular 
monument of human ingenuity dedicated to so 
small an object would be almost worth a par 
ticular examination even if its real character had 
been universally appreciated and it had been suf 
fered to take its place amongst the obsolete sys 
tems of past ages but since its claims to prac 
tical importance have been recently revived and 
reasserted by writers distinguished for their talents 
and learning an attempt to estimate the value of 
its rules seems an indispensable step in the treat 
ment of my subject although it will be giving to 
the question a larger space than in such a treatise 
it ought naturally to occupy

ment to which its own theory has confined it to 
inquire how efficiently it perforins its part in the 
limited province which logicians so long mistook 
for the whole domain of reasoning and when 
as i further purpose to do i have followed up 
this examination and my previous exposition of 
the principles and forms of reasoning by some 
remarks on the value of the system as externally 
manifested by its effects in action and in science 
and on its influence as an intellectual discipline 
i shall have taken a survey of its most important 
features 


section iii 

subject continued mode of using the syllogistic 
form 

in order to clear the way for the inquiry proposed 
in the last section it is necessary to premise that 
there are two different views entertained or enter 
tainable of the way in which the syllogistic form 
ought to be employed 

one of these views regards the regular syllogism 
as a method of arguing which is to be commonly 
adopted 

the other regards it simply as a form into 
which any arguments may be thrown for the pur 
pose of testing their validity and disclaims it as the 
ordinary instrument of reasoning or controversy 
with regard to the first which was the view 


 


rules in reasoning 


 


that long prevailed in the schools it is obvious to 
modern eyes that to adopt the syllogism as the 
ordinary method of conducting argumentation even 
on the supposition of its being the universal type 
of reasoning would be excessively tedious and em 
barrassing and indeed at the present stage of 
intellectual advancement impracticable 

this view accordingly of the proper method of 
applying the syllogistic art is now not only aban 
doned but we are told that “it is a mistake to 
suppose that aristotle and other logicians meant 
to propose that this prolix form of unfolding ar 
guments should universally supersede in argu 
mentative discourses the common forms of ex 
pression” 

whatever may be the light in which modern 
writers may regard the subject this prolix form 
nevertheless was not only for a long period used 
in the schools as the most efficient instrument 
of controversy and the best method of pursuing 
truth but even so late as the early part of the 
eighteenth century the utility of carrying on a 
controversy in writing by a mutual exchange of 
syllogisms and with a strict observance of the 
legitimate forms was maintained by no less a 
philosopher than leibnitz 

since however the common employment of the 
syllogistic form in argumentative discourse or con 
troversy is no longer advocated it must be ex 
amined in the character in which it presents itself 

k 


 



 the theory of reasoning 

to us in the writings of its modem expositors 
namely as a form into which reasoning may be 
reduced in order that the rules of logic may be 
applied as tests for trying the validity of argu 
ments its claims are thus stated by one of the 
most eminent amongst the logical writers of the 
day “ logic” says dr whately “ which is as 
it were the grammar of reasoning does not bring 
forward the regular syllogism as a distinct mode 
of argumentation designed to be substituted for 
any other mode but as the form to which all cor 
rect reasoning may be ultimately reduced and 
which consequently serves the purpose when we 
are employing logic as an art of a test to try the 
validity of any argument in the same manner as 
by chemical analysis we develope and submit to a 
distinct examination the elements of which any 
compound body is composed and are thus enabled 
to detect any latent sophistication and impurity” 
in this statement however of the mode in which 
the form is to be used the syllogism itself is repre 
sented as a test while it manifestly can be con 
sidered only as the shape into which classrea 
soning may be put in order to apply the several 
tests furnished by the rules of the art it is not 
the bed on which the logical procrustes is to lay 
his victims but only the outstretched posture in 
which he is to place them upon it

section iy 

the subject of rules continued rules of the 
scholastic logic 

agreeably to what has been stated in the pre 
ceding section we are now to consider the scho 
lastic logic as a guide to correct conclusions by 
furnishing tests for the detection of fallacies in that 
variety of reasoning which comes under the desig 
nation of classreasoning 

in this character the system might perhaps be 
reasonably expected to do two things first to 
give us directions for reducing with all prac 
ticable readiness and precision the arguments 
which we meet with or which occur to us into 
the syllogistic form secondly to furnish us with 
the best rules for testing the validity of the syllo 
gisms when they are before us in the first re 
spect here mentioned the common treatises on 
logic as far as i am acquainted with them afford 
us little help logicians may perhaps consider 
it as being like the laying down of premises out 
of their province yet this after all is the great 
difficulty which the anxious searcher after right 
conclusions has to cope with generally speaking

to be discerned when it has been stripped of un

necessary incumbrances and reduced to the form 
of two or three definite propositions 

in reference to the second and easier assistance 
which the system ought to furnish there is no 
similar deficiency logical treatises abound with 
rules for insuring the correctness of the syllogistic 
process and the detection of errors in it they 
give us copious directions how to deal with any 
syllogisms which may present themselves to our 
notice they in truth encumber us with help but 
with help of a peculiarly artificial character the 
general scope indeed of the scholastic system may 
be described to be to enable us by the adoption of 
technical language and distinctions to apply me 
chanical rules to reasoning when it has been 
brought into the syllogistic form the question 
we have now to try is not between rules and no 
rules but between natural and artificial rules 

a recourse to mechanical rules in the way de 
scribed which is essentially an artificial method 
in order to supersede the direct application of the 
mind to the subject in hand which may be called 
the natural method is in truth substituting pro 
cesses requiring little or no thought when once 
learned for such as demand conscious intelligence 

 perhaps the student might derive some useful hints 
towards this species of reduction from the abbe gaultier’s 
ingenious work entitled “ a method of making abridgments 
or easy and certain rules for analysing authors” london

at every step and seems eligible only under certain 
conditions 

if the natural method is sufficiently simple and 
easy and fully adequate to its purpose the intro 
duction of an artificial one is a sheer impertinence 
entailing waste of time and labour if on the 
other hand such mechanical rules replace a long 
by a compendious process or a difficult by an easy 
one or lead us to the desired result with more 
certain accuracy than precepts or principles which 
keep the matter throughout present to our con 
sciousness there is a presumptive advantage in 
resorting to their assistance in these cases they 
can be wisely rejected only on the ground that 
they are attended with preponderant evils in other 
directions and when they enable us to accomplish 
valuable ends which could not be effected at all 
without them there can be no question as to the 
wisdom of calling them to our aid 

some of the systems of artificial memory for 
instance appear to have the merit of enabling 
those persons who use them to remember things 
which they could not otherwise so firmly retain or 
recollect with equal promptitude and accuracy 
but it may be justly objected that this advantage 
which is at best only one of degree is dearly pur 
chased at the expense of connecting our knowledge 
with images and sounds and other associations to 
which it has no natural affinity and thus filling 
the mind with incongruous and fantastic trains of

thought accordingly such expedients except a 
few of the simplest kind in which the alleged evil 
is not prominent have fallen into general neglect 

on the other hand those technical terms and 
mechanical rules and formulas which are employed 
in the various departments of calculation although 
they may not be improving to our principal mental 
faculties do not at all events fill the mind with 
incongruities while they in some cases substitute 
short and easy processes for longer and more diffi 
cult ones and in others enable us to arrive at 
results which we should vainly attempt without 
them 

that the peculiar assistance which the scholastic 
logic holds out is of this technical and mechanical 
character no one will probably dispute its pro 
fessed business is to leave out of consideration 
facts and things and deal with terms and propo 
sitions and these it denudes as much as possible 
of meaning that their most general relations may 
be alone regarded 

moreover after affixing technical acceptations 
to certain words it constructs rules and symbols 
by the observance and employment of which we 
may draw our conclusions correctly without taking 
into view the particular signification of what we 
are reasoning about — without in truth any expen 
diture of thought and of course by the me 
chanical application of these rules to the arguments 
of others we may test their soundness with a 


 


rules in seasoning 


 


similar disregard of their special import the 
questions then which we have to consider are 
whether these mechanical tests are needed and are 
superior in efficiency to such as we may derive 
when requisite from the matter and meaning of 
the reasoning and whether they are not attended 
with intellectual disadvantages which must in 
any case render their adoption inexpedient 

the principal constituent parts of this mechan 
ical ordeal and it will not probably be deemed 
requisite to examine any other than these are the 
rules relating to the distribution of terms the 
devices and directions for reducing what are called 
imperfect syllogisms to the first figure and the 
canons or maxims which have been introduced to 
supersede the necessity of such a reduction 

our first business then will be to examine 
whether the rules relating to the distribution of 
terms furnish any valuable assistance 

let us take one of the rules laid down on this 
point “no term must be distributed in the con 
clusion which was not distributed in one of the 
premises ” and let us apply it to the following 
reasoning 

all men are mortal 

angels are not men 

therefore angels are not mortal 

now in order to determine whether this syllo 
gism is valid by the above rule you must examine 
the two terms in the conclusion when you will 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


find that both of them are there distributed you 
find further that the minor term “ angels ” is 
distributed in the premises but that the major 
term “ mortal ” is not distributed in the premises 
the rule consequently is violated there is what is 
called an illicit process of the major and the 
syllogism is not valid 

no doubt that in this way we detect the fallacy 
but surely we detect it at once without passing 
through this examination of the technical con 
formity of the terms to the logical canon we see 
from the meaning of the propositions that the 
argument is unsound as readily as we discern that 
a term is distributed in the conclusion which is 
not distributed in the premises a person who 
was unacquainted with the distribution of terms 
on hearing such an argument would probably 
exclaim “ angels are not mortal because they are 
not men who are mortal why the same reason 
would prove that pigs are immortal if men were 
the only mortal beings in the universe the reasoning 
would be good” 

it is obvious that the circumstance of your not 
belonging to a given class is no proof that you do 
not possess any quality in common with the class 
you are not a cow but this is no proof that you 
do not breathe 

the same result will attend an examination of 
the rule which requires the distribution of the 
middle term i have seen it somewhere argued 


 



rules in reasoning 


 


that the very viciousness of negroes proves them 
to be men putting this argument syllogistically 
and supplying for the sake of illustration a major 
premise to suit our purpose we have 

all men are vicious 

negroes are vicious 

therefore they are men 

here a logician would at once see that the middle 
term “ vicious ” is not distributed and would pro 
nounce the argument unsound but it is just as 
easy to see that the fact of negroes being vicious 
would not prove them to be men unless that 
quality were the exclusive attribute of men 

the logical rule is that the middle term must 
be distributed otherwise the syllogism is false 

the real or material rule is that the possession 
of one quality or one set of qualities in common 
with a given class does not of itself prove the 
possessors to belong to the class a cow breathes 
in common with human beings but this is no proof 
that she belongs to the genus homo 

the technical rule is not only without any pre 
tension to be easier of application than the material 
one but it tends to keep out of sight the substance 
of the fallacy committed in fact the system 
puts us in such cases to twofold or threefold 
trouble we have first to learn the rule and to 
discern its validity and we have then to apply it 
mechanically to the syllogism before us but 
neither of these steps is easier than the immediate

discernment of the substantial error in the rea 
soning by an equal application of the mind to the 
matter of the argument 

the rules nevertheless regarding the distri 
bution of terms and the rules generally regarding 
syllogisms although such as are merely technical 
might be replaced with advantage by what i have 
called material rules are at all events easy of 
acquisition as well as capable of being readily 
turned to some account and hence are by no 
means the most exceptionable features of the scho 
lastic logic 

the second class of rules before mentioned viz 
those relating to the reduction of syllogisms and 
to what are denominated the moods and figures 
which make a great show in logical treatises con 
stitute a much more objectionable part of the 
system demanding wearisome study before any 
one can attain such a familiarity with them as is 
requisite for use and yielding no fruit but what 
if i may hazard the metaphor on such a subject 
is full of the ashes of time thus laboriously con 
sumed 

the acknowledged fact to which i have before 
adverted that every syllogism is not an exemplifi 
cation of the dictum or in the language of lo 
gicians that the dictum is not directly applicable 
to every syllogism led to two different modes of 
proceeding in order to prove still to use their

own language the validity of the reasoning in such 
cases the first and this was the method of ari 
stotle himself was to have recourse to the con 
version of propositions and the transposition of 
premises for the purpose of bringing every syllo 
gism that did not exemplify the maxim into a 
shape in which it would i e under what is tech 
nically called the first figure 

thus the scheme of moods and figures the bar 
barous phraseology by which the former are desig 
nated and the reduction of syllogisms according to 
certain literal indications from one mood and figure 
to another may be regarded as the progeny of the 
unsound doctrine that all reasoning proceeds on 
one principle and of the supposed necessity of 
bringing all arguments under it 

in the chapter on the general principles of 
reasoning i have shown that each figure or variety 
of syllogism proceeds on or exemplifies its own 
principle and such being the case if it is neces 
sary on any occasion to appeal after the manner 
of mathematicians to any axiom the particular 
maxims belonging to the figure may be cited 
without resorting to the intricate machinery for 
transmuting one form of argument into another 

let us examine nevertheless what this process 
of reduction effects take an example from dr 
whately he gives us the following syllogism in 
the mood camestres as one to be reduced 


 



 


tiie theory of reasoning 


all true philosophers account virtue a good in 
itself 

the advocates of pleasure do not account 
virtue a good in itself 

therefore they are not true philosophers 

one would think this sufficiently plain but it 
does not come within the first figure it must 
therefore be brought into a mood which does 
reduced to the mood celarent by conversion and 
transposition the syllogism assumes the following 
appearance 

those who account virtue a good in itself are 
not advocates of pleasure 

all true philosophers account virtue a good in 
itself 

therefore no true philosophers are advocates 
of pleasure 

but still the conclusion we have got is not the 
original conclusion and in order to show that we 
have obtained an equivalent one we must force it 
to undergo illative conversion when it will emerge 
in the form of no advocates of pleasure are true phi 
losophers which must in its turn be transmuted 
by a slight alteration into the equipollent and pris 
tine proposition the advocates of pleasure are not 
true philosophers and at length our work is done 

it is manifest that here after all this logical 
labour and circuitous ingenuity we gain nothing 
the syllogism which issues out of the operation 
is not in the slightest degree clearer than the ori 
ginal one

so much for the first method of getting over the 
inapplicability of the dictum to the second third 
and fourth figures the second method was to 
allow the refractory syllogisms in these figures to 
retain their forms and to call in the aid of other 
principles or maxims which might be directly 
applied to them discarding altogether the process 
of reduction it borrowed two mathematical axioms 
changing the term equality to that of agreement 
they are “if two things or terms agree with 
one and the same third they agree with each 
other ” and “ if one thing or term agrees and 
another disagrees with one and the same third 
they disagree with each other” 

if these maxims are taken in their obvious ac 
ceptation they are such as many of our common 
reasonings exemplify thus we sometimes argue 
that two objects agree in form colour smoothness 
temperature resplendence and other qualities be 
cause they have been severally compared with a 
third object and found to resemble it in these 
respects in this acceptation they further elu 
cidate the truth that demonstration proceeds on a 
variety of principles besides the dictum 

but this is not the sense in which the logical 
canons are to be understood the phrase “ agree 
ing icith a term is to be taken in a peculiar tech 
nical acceptation and unless certain rules re 
specting the comparison and agreement of wholes 
and parts of terms are understood and observed the 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


maxims as they are called are neither evident 
nor applicable 

it is obvious that these maxims so interpreted 
are not analogous to such as were considered in the 
chapter on that subject they are not educible 
from the syllogisms in any of the figures nor are 
they to be classed with the mathematical axioms 
from which they have been transformed bearing 
the semblance of selfevident maxims they are in 
truth very artificial rules by which with the help 
of other rules and technical distinctions the va 
lidity of syllogisms may be tested 

 logicians are far from being agreed as to the merits of 
the method here described wallis speaks of it in the following 
terms “ nonnulli autem logici nostri seculi aut superioris 
posthabitu veterum probatione per dictum de omni et de hullo 
aliud substituunt illius loco postulatum nimirum qua con 
veniunt in eodem tertio conveniunt inter se atque ad hanc 
regulam exigentes singulos syllogismorum modos inde con 
clusum eunt justam eorum consecutionem quique sic proce 
dunt negligere possunt earn distinctionem modorum perfectorum 
et imperfectorum ut quae ortum ducit ab ea methodo qua usi 
sunt veteres in probatione sua ab illo dicto ego veterum 
probationem ut potiorem amplector aristotelis methodo con 
formem” — institutio logicce lib iii cap 

it may be well to subjoin mr walker’s commentary on this 
method “ but clear as these principles are in mathematics 
when transferred by analogy to the agreement or disagreement 
of terms or ideas in affirmative or negative propositions they 
by no means have that definite and certain meaning which ib 
necessary in principles that are taken for the basis of such a 
superstructure as the doctrine of syllogisms aristotle had too 
much penetration to rest the doctrine on this foundation” — 
commentary on the dublin compendium of logic by john 
walker th cd p

it is needless perhaps to task the reader’s 
patience by any detail in reference to this second 
method in order however to complete the sur 
vey of these mechanical aids i will adduce a single 
example of the way in which it is carried into 
effect 

let the syllogism to be put on its trial be the 
following 

some logical writers are tedious 

wallis is a logical writer 

therefore wallis is tedious 

here the major term tedious has been com 
pared to only a part of the middle term logical 
writers and the minor term wallis also to only a 
part of it and since these two parts for aught 
that appears may be different portions of the same 
whole it cannot be affirmed that the major and 
minor terms have been compared with one and the 
same third nor consequently that they agree with 
each other the canon has not been complied with 
and the conclusion does not follow from the pre 
mises wallis is not proved to be a tedious writer 

this is all very true but it is a very round 
about method of detecting a fallacy which is ob 
vious on a bare inspection or which may be made 
apparent if any aid be wanted in so plain a case 
by a simple material rule or which may be made 
readily proved even by resorting to the rule which 
requires the distribution of the middle term 

as a method of testing syllogisms it is scarcely 

l 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


less intricate and not more satisfactory than the 
other methods already examined 

from the whole of this i fear wearisome inves 
tigation it results that the logical system will not 
bear the criteria applied to it 

such an artificial system is needless because 
the natural method is ready of application and 
suificient of itself it does not substitute com 
pendious processes for long ones nor such as are 
easy for such as are difficult nor those which are 
more certain for those which are less to be relied 
upon and it has not the slightest pretensions to 
the power of conducting us to results which we 
could not reach without its assistance while on 
the other hand the study of it requires a great 
expenditure of time and labour and as i shall en 
deavour to show hereafter is attended from its very 
nature with intellectual evils of no inconsiderable 
moment 


section y 

the subject of rules continued rules of the 
scholastic logic 

from the preceding examination it appears that 
there are only two or three errors worth notice 
which all these distinctions and canons have been 
devised to guard us against and in the course 

 i have not taken cognizance of the rules about negative 
premises and the infraction of them because they seem to be 


 


rules in reasoning 


 


of it the obvious truth has been pointed out that 
if rules are at all necessary or useful a few easy 
material rules would serve the purpose 

but i have very strong doubts whether the 
errors in question are ever committed except from 
confusion or ambiguity of language or possibly 
from such a separation of the premises from the 
conclusion as may occasion a misrecollection of 
what they are in each of which cases no assist 
ance could be derived from logical rules 

a valid syllogism when clearly expressed is 
discerned at once to be valid the conclusion is 
seen to be demonstrated by the premises and a 
denial of it to involve a contradiction the 
validity of the syllogism itself is a thing beyond 
proof 

but if a valid syllogism is in this way discerned 
to be conclusive a fallacious syllogism would in 
the same way be at once discerned to be fallacious 
or inconclusive under the same condition viz 
when clearly expressed 

it follows that when faults are committed in 
syllogistic reasoning they must be owing to want 
of clearness and preciseness of expression and the 

passed over by logical writers with the barest mention indeed 
the purely logical fallacies to guard against which the artificial 
system just examined is solely applicable are allowed to 
occupy very little space in most treatises on the subject — and 
deservedly but the reader is constantly wondering why so 
complicated an apparatus is introduced for an end apparently 
so small in itself and so little thought of by its expositors 

l 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


infallible way to test the soundness and unsound 
ness of such reasoning is to supply what it wants — 
to throw it into precise and perspicuous language 
this must be sufficient in the nature of the case 
to bring all errors to light 

it may be presumed therefore that the fallacies 
which we have already passed in review under the 
names of nondistribution of the middle term and 
illicit processes when they do occur in regular 
syllogisms are owing to ambiguity or confusion of 
language in other words they are never com 
mitted when the premises are fully and clearly 
stated in proper juxtaposition with the conclusion 
let us take an example of the nondistribution of 
the middle term 

some animals are coldblooded 

the sheep is an animal 

therefore the sheep is coldblooded 

in a syllogism expressed in this clear unam 
biguous manner such a conclusion may be safely 
pronounced to be impossible 

it may be instructive to remark that the only 
discernible or assignable difference between such a 
logical fallacy and drawing an unwarranted infer 
ence from an insufficient induction of facts is that 
in the latter case the “ some animals ” adduced 
are avowedly although erroneously taken as suffi 
cient specimens of the rest and contradictory in 
stances are assumed not to exist whereas in the 
logical error this is not professedly assumed the 
fact of some animals being coldblooded is alleged 


 


rules in reasoning 


 


as a sufficient reason although it is not pretended 
that there are not also some animals which are 
warmblooded for concluding any other animal to 
be so but a logical error of this kind is so very 
absurd that it is doubtful whether any human 
mind ever really committed it the actual mistake 
being either an insufficient induction or a fault in 
expression 

there is the case indeed of disparted premises 
and conclusion already named in which we may 
conceive that the logical error might possibly 
occur or seem to occur it sometimes happens 
that the premises and the conclusion of an argu 
ment are widely separated from each other by 
irrelevant matter superfluous verbiage or prolix 
dissertation so that when the conclusion is ar 
rived at the premises are but indistinctly recalled 
and thus the reasoner himself may be betrayed 
into an inference which they will not support and 
into which the reader will in all likelihood supinely 
follow him this however is misrecollection or 
misconception of what the premises really are and 

 mr ilallam is the only logician as far as i know who has 
remarked in such instances the close similarity of the inductive 
to the logical error and the circumstance of one being some 
times confounded with the other he observes that “ the as 
sertion of a general premise upon an insufficient examination 
of particulars ” “ is the error into which men really fall not that 
of omitting to distribute the middle term though it comes in 
effect and often in appearance to the same thing” — intro 
duction to the literature of europe vol iii p 

l 


 


 


the theory of reasoning 


not a wrong inference from them nor could the 
error be prevented or detected by any logical rule 
but if the argument were freed from its encum 
brances and premises and conclusion clearly ex 
pressed were brought into juxtaposition the bad 
reasoning would be too manifest to impose upon a 
child 

let us next take an example of the illicit pro 
cess of the major term 

all vegetables grow 

animals are not vegetables 

therefore animals do not grow 

is it conceivable that any one could commit a 
fallacy of this nature — that a naturalist for 
example after collecting instances to show that a 
class possess a certain quality should adduce this 
collective fact in proof that a totally different class 
do not possess it surely absurdities of this 
kind of which no one is likely even to approach 
the brink are beneath the attention of the logical 
legislator rules devised as a safeguard against 
mistakes which there is no danger of a sane mind 
falling into may be multiplied without end but 
they can form only a dead weight on the system 
into which they are introduced 

if logical errors are thus owing in all cases 
except in the peculiar case of separated premises 
and conclusion to faults of expression what as 
sistance does the scholastic system afford for guard 
ing against this source of fallacy none i am

persuaded worth regarding it is not even pre 
tended that it affords much 

it has indeed been urged by some writers that 
the canons of the scholastic logic assist us to dis 
cover them by directing our attention to the 
middle term in which any ambiguity is most 
likely to lurk as may be seen they say in such 
syllogisms as the following — 

light is contrary to darkness 

feathers are light 

therefore feathers are contrary to darkness 

here doubtless the ambiguity is in the middle 
term but the middle term has not unfortunately 
a monopoly of equivocation it is just as easy by 
an ambiguous major term to prove another extra 
ordinary quality in feathers — 

all bodies are heavy 

a feather is a body 

therefore a feather is heavy 

the truth is that in reasoning we are never safe 
without a constant scrutiny of all the words we 
employ e without a perpetual recurrence to the 
things signified and if our attention is directed 
to the middle term more especially than to the 
other terms we may be led to overlook ambiguities 
in the latter which might not otherwise escape us 

all this once more forces upon our minds the 
immense contrast between the elaborate apparatus 
of the scholastic logic and the inconsiderable end 
achieved by it guarding us at the utmost from a

few mistakes in which there is scarcely the slightest 
risk of our being involved except from causes of 
error which it is powerless to obviate or to remedy 

these views coincide with those which appear 
to have been entertained by the authors of the 
“ port royal logic” though not perhaps with 
uniform consistency 

“ if we ever sin” they remark “ against the 
rules of syllogism it is by deceiving ourselves 

with the equivocation of some term 

not but that there are still other vices of reasoning 
besides that which springs from the equivocal 
meaning of terms but these it is almost impossible 
for a man of average mind and possessed of some 
knowledge ever to fall into especially in speculative 
matters and thus it would be useless to give rules 
against these vices and urge their observance and 
it would indeed be frivolous since the application 
which would be given to these superfluous rules 
might divert the attention tvhich we ought to pay 
to things more necessary” 

although i have thus been led to an unfavour 
able appreciation of the system particularly of the 
technical and mechanical apparatus peculiar to it 
i will readily admit that there are some points 
about it which deserve preservation 

few will question that the logic of aristotle and 
his followers furnishes a number of useful as well

as useless distinctions relative to words and pro 
positions and many convenient terms for desig 
nating the parts and incidents of argumentation 
including the different kinds of fallacies into which 
a reason er is apt to fall many however of these 
indeed most of them that can be considered of 
importance are independent of any peculiar theory 
of reasoning and may be regarded as of common 
use 

it must be also admitted that the syllogistic 
form may be usefully employed on some occasions 
without the reasoner troubling himself with any of 
the technicalities of the system we have already 
seen that much reasoning does exemplify or proceed 
upon the dictum de omni et nullo or other allied 
dicta and that many arguments which are usually 
expressed in the form of enthymemes may be 
rightly expanded into syllogisms to draw out 
such arguments when it is needful to examine 
their accuracy into three separate propositions 
enables us to see distinctly and to point out to 
others the facts which must be true or proved or 
admitted in order to render the conclusion valid 
it is a method of spreading out the premises before 
us which may be occasionally resorted to with 
advantage even by those who would discard the 
syllogism as the shape into which every argument 
might be legitimately thrown and who would 
reject all mechanical contrivances for securing a 
correct conclusion 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


here however we are supposing an enthymeme 
ready to our hands while in ordinary cases the 
chief difficulty as i have before remarked would 
lie in reducing the argument into two or three 
distinct propositions not in perceiving the force or 
the fallacy of the reasoning when brought into 
such a regular and definite shape 

we have been hitherto engaged with what may 
be termed the internal merits and demerits of the 
system but it may be instructive to cast a glance 
on its external effects or in other words its prac 
tical value in action and science 

amongst the most plausible attempts to vindi 
cate the practical value of the syllogistic art is 
one to be found in the commentary of mr walker 
on the “ dublin compendium of logic” in which 
he has contrasted the position of an adept in the 
art when engaged in controversy and that of an 
antagonist wholly ignorant of it 

“ a real acquaintance” he says “ with the art 
of logic will abundantly compensate the labour of 
acquiring it nor have i ever met a person un 
acquainted with it who could state and maintain 
his arguments with facility clearness and pre 
cision to instance only in one of the occasions 
to which it may be applied — i have commonly 
seen a man of the acutest mind puzzled by the 
argument of his antagonist sensible perhaps 
that it was inconclusive but wholly unable to 
expose the fallacy which rendered it so while a

logician of perhaps very inferior talents would be 
able at once to discern and to mark it it was 
happily remarked by a late lawyer of eminence 
in a letter to his son that nothing is superior to 
logic for setting a fine edge on the understanding” 

although the correctness of this contrast were 
to be admitted the most important point would 
still be left untouched 

the logician described might doubtless possess 
a superiority over an antagonist who had never 
attended to the nature of reasoning at all or who 
was not familiar with its different phases but 
let us ask how would he compare with one who 
had studied the subject in the pages of locke and 
stewart or in the light in which it has been the 
aim of this treatise to place it whose mind had 
been familiarised with what we are told the scho 
lastic logic disowns — the scrutiny of premises and 
with the processes of direct contingent reasoning 
and especially the formation of general laws from 
collected facts who was capable of discerning 
the exact range of the scholastic system who 
could discriminate a major premise arrived at by 

 familiar commentary p it may amuse the reader to 
compare mr walker’s testimony with that of locke “ i have 
known” the latter says “ a man unskilful in syllogism who at 
first hearing could perceive the weakness and inconclusiveness 
of a long artificial and plausible discourse wherewith others 
better skilled in syllogism have been misled and i believe 
there are few of my readers who do not know such ” — essay on 
human understanding book iv chap xvii

a process of induction from a useless maxim 
forced into the same position upon an already 
effective enthymeme like a crutch thrust into 
the hands of a perfectly sound man and who 
through the mere forms of reasoning could see 
whether an inference was to be regarded as con 
tingently or conclusively demonstrated who in a 
word had within him a distinct consciousness of 
what he was about of the nature of the processes 
in his own mind and a clear view of the bearing 
of the implicated facts independently of the forms 
and phraseology in which they might be expressed 

although one who had studied an erroneous 
theory and an art founded upon it in which 
there would probably be a mixture of truth and 
error might carry off the palm in a contest with 
an adversary who had paid no attention to the 
nature of reasoning at all it is allowable to sup 
pose that he would in his turn find himself 
inferior to another antagonist who was master 
of a more correct theory than his own 

but a still more important question remains 
which of the two would be likely to have greater 
success not in mere personal controversy but in 
the pursuit of truth in the prosecution of science 
in the estimation of evidence and in drawing with 
accuracy those numberless conclusions which are 
required from every one by the daily exigencies of

stance in confirmation of these views of the small 
practical value of the scholastic logic that in the 
rapid progress of science which has marked the last 
two hundred years it appears to have had no share 
and to have yielded no assistance nor have we 
any evidence that the greatest philosophers and the 
most effective reasoners either in practical or specu 
lative matters leibnitz perhaps excepted had so 
much as a tolerable acquaintance with it some of 
them have even been accused of evincing by oc 
casional errors in their casual references or their 
depreciating comments how little they understood 
what they referred to or assailed 

even those writers who have recently attempted 
to revive the attention of the world to its merits 
seem to have contented themselves with a theo 
retical advocacy of its claims for their writings 
furnish few proofs that its technical distinctions and 
mechanical rules have been pressed into actual 
service a casual notice here and there that some 
syllogism which they are employing or commenting 
upon ranks under barbara or baroko is all that 
we meet with 

should it be replied to this allegation that these 
logicians may nevertheless have been tacitly guided 
by its rules although they have not allowed the 
fact to appear the reply may be admitted as pos 
sibly true although not very probably so while we 
have the opposing testimony of no less an authority 
than dr whately who in a remarkable passage

whenever they have to treat of any thing that is

recourse to a loose vague and popular kind of 
language” can there be a more complete sur 
render of the practical value of all that is peculiar 
in the art f 

the case of the mathematicians however is on 
the whole perhaps the most striking 

although many of the steps in geometrical 
reasoning all of them according to the logicians 
themselves may be brought under the dictum de 
omni et nullo and thus fall within the domain of 
formal logic it is notorious that no use of the scho

from the preceding survey of the subject it is 
apparent not only that technical rules by which 
operations of a mechanical character may be em 
ployed to test the validity of arguments are ex 
ceedingly limited in their application and when 
they can be applied are useless or less useful than 
rules founded on the matter or signification of the

and the prosecution of science they are found to be 
practically of little or no value

the theory of reasoning 


the substantial nature of all ratiocination and 
fixing it exclusively or mainly on the adjustment 
of terms and propositions this may perhaps be 
characterised as the grand evil of the aristotelian 
logic by which it has stunted the minds and 
fettered the progress of the most intelligent nations 

it is an important truth too generally overlooked 
that the habitual application of such mechanical 
rules as those we have examined leads the mind 
away from the due appreciation of the realities 
with which reasoning has to do from the ex 
amination of objects and the investigation of 
events it has somewhat of the same effect in 
diverting the mind from the consideration of facts 
that the study of the rules of latin prosody with 
the exercise of making verses according to those 
rules has in turning it aside from attention to the 
rhythm and euphony of the lines the student 
may become exceedingly familiar with the rules 
for long and short syllables and expert in con 
structing verses with the legitimate feet while his 
taste and skill in metrical melody remain unculti 
vated for instead of being guided by the quality 
of the sounds he directs his course in a great 
measure by distinctions founded on the termination 
of syllables and the juxtaposition of letters dis 
tinctions which have to modern ears no direct 
effect on the music of the verse or at all events 
may be observed without any reference to it 

how different is the composition of verse by a 


 



rules in reasoning 


g 


poet in his native tongue he is not under the 
influence of mechanical rules but follows the im 
pulse of his rhythmical taste and feelings or con 
forms to principles founded on the observed effects 
of articulate sounds or of emotions in modulating 
their cadence and hence there is naturally a pro 
gressive improvement in the delicacy of his dis 
crimination and in his power of skilfully arranging 
the march of his verse 

and so in reasoning trained in the distinctions 
of technical logic a man may become dexterous 
in the conversion of propositions and at home in 
moods and figures he may show himself ready in 
the detection of fallacies in form in finding out 
the nondistribution of middle terms and tracing 
illicit processes of the minor and the major at 
least in syllogisms which are prepared to his hands

while in all this the faculty of looking at facts 
estimating their value discovering what they prove 
and extricating them from any verbiage in which 
they may be involved which would have been

material principles of reasoning remains compara 
tively unexercised

the scholastic logicians without being struck with

transport the mathematician from the data to the

unlike geometrical demonstration which compels 
him to walk over every inch of the road and be

questionable value as a discipline of the mind is 
unquestionably a most powerful and an indis

pure geometrical operations could never reach

clumsy and circuitous method of arriving at its

erroneous conclusions 


 


chap xii 

tiie source of ekroneous conclusions 

from the survey which we have now taken of the 
field of reasoning we shall be prepared to enter 
upon that most important question to which any 
theory on the subject of this treatise necessarily 
leads viz “ what are the sources of erroneous 
conclusions ” 

reasoning consists in coming to conclusions and 
the sole legitimate object of the process is to come 
to such as are correct why we do not always 
succeed in attaining this end it must be instructive 
to inquire by erroneous conclusions i here mean 
false propositions at which we have arrived by in 
ference whatever may have been the sources of the 
error whether false facts in the premises or some 
false step in the reasoning process itself this 

 i have not entered into the consideration of fallacies 
except in so far as the subject of this chapter required it 
partly because a minute exposition of them belongs rather to 
the art than to the theory of reasoning and partly because 
they have been very excellently and fully explained by several 
modern writers particularly by dr whately and mr john 
mill in their works already referred to and by mr de morgan 
in his “ formal logic”

tue theory of reasoning 


remark indicates two of the great sources of erro 
neous conclusions viz wrong facts or premises 
and wrong processes of inference 

when we undertake a journey we may fail to 
reach the proposed end either by setting out in a 
wrong direction or if we set out right by de 
viating from the true path in the course of our 
progress 

in contingent as indeed in all other reasoning 
the premises are of course wrong when the facts 
asserted in them are either wholly or partially 
incorrect we may from inaccurate observation 
or misconception or inisrecollection or other causes 
be led to propound that all a’s as far as our know 
ledge has extended have been found possessed of 
the attribute b when in truth to take an extreme 
case no a’s have been found to possess that at 
tribute 

if from such false observation or undue assump 
tion we proceed to infer that all a’s possess b or 
that any unobserved a possesses b it is an in 
stance of an erroneous conclusion of which the 
source is an erroneous premise 

on the other hand the process of inferring a 
conclusion in contingent reasoning is wrong when 
the facts contained in the premises although they 
are correct are not sufficient to warrant the in 
ference we draw from them 

thus we may lay down a universal law in the 
form of all a’s possess the attribute b when the 


 


erroneous conclusions 


 


facts warrant us only in the inference that all a’s 
probably possess the attribute b 

the universal law in this case would not be a 
false conclusion from false facts but would proceed 
from an erroneous estimate of what the correct 
facts of the case enable us legitimately to infer 
it would be an instance of undue or unwarranted 
generalisation 

in demonstrative reasoning there are two cases 
to be noted 

in such as consist of one premise of the nature 
of a minor and an inference erroneous conclusions 
are scarcely possible except from false facts and 
these latter are almost excluded from the principal 
species of such reasoning viz mathematical by 
the circumstance that the facts about which it is 
conversant are few and simple 

with the greater part of syllogistic reasoning 
the case is otherwise here erroneous conclusions 
may proceed both from wrong premises and from 
wrong processes of inference the wrong pre 
mises as in the case of contingent reasoning 
assert false facts and frequently owe their origin 
to false general laws obtained by such reasoning 
but in a far greater proportion they may be traced 
to pure gratuitous assumption of general propo 
sitions which are not true

only ones claiming attention arc of two kinds

term and illicit processes of the major and minor 
terms which i have endeavoured to show are never 
committed when the propositions of a syllogism are 
clearly before the mind and which may therefore 
be referred to the head of errors attributable to 
the ambiguity or confusion of terms 

this brings before us the third great source of 
erroneous conclusions every species and variety 
of reasoning are liable to be vitiated and their 
conclusions rendered erroneous by the imperfec 
tion of language as an instrument of thought and 
communication but less so in proportion as the 
subjects of the reasoning are simple in mathe 
matical demonstration indeed this disturbance 
may be said to be nought while in contingent and 
classreasoning generally it extensively prevails 

this imperfection of language produces its fal 
lacious results chiefly when the terms employed 
are complex general or abstract and when the 
reasoning is complicated immethodical disjointed 
and verbose when on the contrary the words 
are simple and concrete and the reasoning is 
well arranged and condensed it has little room to 
operate 

from this brief glance at the subject we may 
gather that the three great sources of false con 
clusions are imperfections in language insufficient 
induction of facts and the assumption of false 
facts or to vary the expression of fictitious pre 
mises 


 



erroneous conclusions 

their comparative importance appears to me to 
be in the inverse order in which they are here 
mentioned and that of the last to be by far the 
greatest of all the few remarks upon them which 
follow will however serve to illustrate their abso 
lute rather than their comparative influence 

the imperfections of language are universally 
allowed to have great effect in perverting our con 
clusions and it is acknowledged and regretted that 
rules and formulas can do little in guarding against 
them habits of mind nevertheless can do a great 
deal 

but by the term imperfections must be under 
stood not mere equivocation of words but the 
vagueness and obscurity and unmeaningness of 
language all of which are to be sedulously guarded 
against and the best preservative against these 
evils is an intellectual habit quite opposed to that 
which it is the tendency of the scholastic logic to 
engender — the habit of calling vividly to mind the 
objects and qualities and events designated by the 
phrases employed of dwelling upon the full and 
precise meaning of all the words on which our 
reasoning turns of picturing to ourselves what 
ever is described or narrated of turning the ab 
stract into the concrete and reducing the general 
to the particular this practice on all important 
occasions would save us from a thousand illusions 
which the custom of being satisfied with vague and 


 



 


tie theory of reasoning 


indistinct conceptions or even with such abstract 
generalities as may be all that in the eye of logic 
the reasoning we are engaged with can require 
creates and perpetuates 

“ unless” says berkeley “ we take care to clear 
the first principles of knowledge from the embarrass 
and delusion of words we may make infinite rea 
sonings upon them to no purpose we may draw 
consequences from consequences and be never the 
wiser the further we go we shall only lose our 
selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper 
entangled in difficulties and mistakes” 

the second source of erroneous conclusions before 
specified may be justly considered as equal if not 
superior in importance to the first and extensively 
pervades the thoughts and language of mankind 
men are constantly in the habit of drawing general 
conclusions from instances too few in number or 
too incompletely sifted to warrant them in other 
words from an insufficient induction of factsf

peculiar quality or habit and immediately sets it

comes upon an event which happens to have been 
ushered in by certain preliminary circumstances 
and he forthwith assumes it as a general law that 
such circumstances are the invariable precursors of 
such events medical practitioners and especially 
such as are proverbially said to have fools for their 
patients will frequently consider a single instance 
of recovery from disease after the administration 
of a particular drug as sufficient to establish the 
universal efficacy of the medicine in similar cases 

i have cited illustrations of this familiar character 
because the great field now for errors of this de 
scription is not to be found in physical science but 
in common life such fallacies form one of the 
main characteristics of loose thinking in the bulk of 
mankind but these undue generalisations are not 
seldom found in systematic writers on moral and po 
litical philosophy and it is sometimes amusing to 
notice the subsequent fallacies which flow from them 
the law enunciated ought it is manifest to be laid 
down from the widest possible survey of facts 
but as by the supposition it has been formed 
from a very partial view should any hostile facts 
subsequently present themselves such facts in 
stead of being allowed to modify the general law 
are too often brought under it by an adroit ex 
tension or perversion of the terms in which the 
law is expressed 

a curious instance of this verbal legerdemain 


 



 


the theory of reasoning 


was furnished by some political economists many 
years ago in order to support the sweeping gene 
ralisation that the values of all commodities are in 
direct proportion to the quantities of labour be 
stowed upon them a number of instances were 
pointed out in which this did not hold and 
amongst the rest the instance of wine which by 
being simply kept in a cellar without any fresh 
expenditure of labour upon it becomes greatly en 
hanced in value such cases evidently required some 
modification of the general principle or rather an 
ascent to a higher principle embracing both kinds 
of instances but the economists in question 
were not to be driven from their position by 
such hostile facts as these they preserved the 
integrity of their rule by maintaining that when 
wine had been raised in value suppose one tenth 
by being kept a considerable period one tenth of 
additional labour might be correctly considered as 
expended upon it on the ground that capital 
might be said to be employed during that time 
and capital is hoarded labour thus an incorrect 
generalisation of facts was supported by an equally 
incorrect generalisation of a word 

the greatest source however of erroneous con 
clusions transcending all others in an almost im 
measurable degree is the gratuitous assumption of 
false premises without any evidence at all these 
erroneous premises are assumed in various ways 


 



erroneous conclusions 


 


a large majority of them are mere prejudices fas 
tened upon the mind by tradition or instilled into 
it by dogmatic instruction or caught from the 
unanimous voice of society or of books and are 
never suspected of error 

they thus come to form the laws from which 
on a thousand occasions we unhesitatingly reason 
and are the foundation of those extraordinary 
erroneous conclusions which have been prevalent 
amongst mankind in every age and every country 

but what are prejudices now must have been at 
the outset direct errors and it is a part of the 
inquiry how they came first into being what 
were the original causes of the fallacies which have 
thus hardened into prejudices and been transmitted 
from one age to another 

the chief of these causes we shall find in cir 
cumstances which still prevail and perpetually 
form new and direct sources of error such as im 
perfectly observing the objects and events around 
and within us and thence drawing erroneous 
general inferences as already explained mistaking 
unconscious inferences for facts and above all 
supposing facts without any evidence misappre 
hending for realities what are mere hypothetical 
assumptions of our own minds mere figments of 
imagination to which causes may be added as 
frequent in every age particularly amongst the 
rude and uncultivated a strong tendency to exag

geration and to the invention as well as to the 
belief of marvellous events 

in all these and numberless other ways man 
kind come to have in their minds wrong grounds of 
inference false facts and erroneous general propo 
sitions from which they reason or to express it 
still differently unsound premises from which 
they deduce conclusions of corresponding unsound 
ness 

in reference to all these sources of erroneous con 
clusions there is one point on which it is almost 
impossible to insist too strongly — the extreme im 
portance of rigorously scrutinising facts and terms 
and inferences at the commencement of all inves 
tigations 

the origin of a false theory or a series of false 
doctrines may be generally detected in some error 
lurking in the very first propositions from which it 
sets out and it scarcely needs enforcing on the 
inquirer of how much more consequence an error 
is there than at any subsequent stage of the 
treatise or speculation in which it occurs 

it is like an oversight committed in the second 
or third term of a geometrical progression com 
pared to one of equal numerical magnitude in the 
last term of a long series

erroneous conclusions 


 


the justness of such general observations as 
have been now given is never so well discerned as 
when they are elucidated by particular instances 
and i will therefore briefly cite examples of the 
three principal sources of erroneous conclusions 
described viz ambiguities of language insuffi 
cient or faulty induction leading to undue gene 
ralisation and the assumption of mere suppositions 
for real facts 

the examples which i shall adduce of these 
three several errors i have selected with the view 
of also showing how needful it is to examine with 
the utmost vigilance whether such errors infect 
the original positions from which any theory sets 
out 

of the firstnamed error a memorable illustration 
is to be found in the writings of mr ricardo a 
number of erroneous and nugatory conclusions 
in his principal work on political economy of 
which some appear glaringly paradoxical and 
others on a cursory inspection wear such a sem 
blance of profundity as to have misled distin 
guished economists had their source in a con 
fused and ambiguous use of the word value which 
may be detected even in the first section of his 
first chapter and pervades the whole of his 
treatise 

the readiest way of explaining and elucidating 
this ambiguity will be to cite a passage from a 
work in which it is freely exposed 


 


 tiie theory of reasoning 

“ while mr ricardo professedly used the term 
value in one sense only that of purchasing power 
he insensibly lapsed into a different sense” “ the 
passage in his book where this transition is 
made the turning point if i may so call it is in 
the very first section having quoted a few sen 
tences from adam smith which explain that in 
rude ages the quantities in which commodities 
were exchanged would be determined by the quan 
tities of labour necessary to acquire them he pro 
ceeds if the quantity of labour realised in com 
modities regulate their exchangeable value every 
increase of the quantity of labour must augment 
the value of that commodity on which it is ex 
ercised as every diminution must lower it’ now 
here mr ricardo begins with using value in the 
sense of exchangeable value or purchasing power 
and as he uses it in that sense in the premises 
he is bound to do it in the conclusion and the 
conclusion is true enough if he means that every 
increase in the quantity of labour must augment 
the value of that commodity on which it is exer 
cised in relation to other commodities which con 
tinued to require only the same labour as before 
this however although perfectly consonant with 
his doctrines will not be found to have been mr 
ricardo’s peculiar meaning in this proposition 
he did not extend his view beyond the one commo 
dity the word value did not carry him over as 
the phrase power of purchasing would have done to 


 



erroneous conclusions 


 


the consideration of some other an attentive 
reader will perceive his meaning to have been 
that every increase of labour would augment the 
value of the commodity on which it was exercised 
without reference to any other commodity this 
proposition is the hook from which all his other 
propositions inconsistent with his own definition 
depend this one false step made he very lo 
gically falls into the obscurities and paradoxes 
which have excited the admiration of his disciples 
and the astonishment of every body else” 

the theory of mr malthus on population is a 
most instructive example of the second error it 
shows what a long train of unsound inferences may 
be consequent on the precipitate formation of a 
general law from an insufficient collection of facts 
and this is to be found at the outset of his specula 
tions where it is assumed on the slenderest grounds 
that in all the various races of men under all cir 
cumstances habits climates and conditions there 
is a uniform tendency to double their numbers in 
twentyfive years or less a rate of increase which 
becomes certain provided they are supplied with 
sufficient food shelter and clothing but such a 
sufficiency in the long run they never can be sup 
plied with inasmuch as food increases in only an 
arithmetical ratio even if mr malthus’s theory

could be proved to be correct the way in which he 
obtained his fundamental principles would ever re 
main a memorable instance of hasty generalisation 
not merely as represented by others but as recorded 
by himself 

it fortunately happens that we have an account 
of the matter in his own words nothing can be 
more explicit than the following statement 

“ it has been said” writes mr malthus “ that i 
have written a quarto volume to prove that popu 
lation increases in a geometrical ratio and food in 
an arithmetical ratio but this is not quite true 
the first of these propositions i considered as proved 
the moment the american increase was related and 
the second proposition as soon as it was enunciated 
the chief object of my work was to inquire what 
effects these laws which i consider as established 
in the first six pages had produced and were likely 
to produce on society” 

thus of two important propositions teeming 
with consequences he considered the first which 
in truth required to be substantiated by extensive 
research and cautious discrimination as proved by 
one solitary instance and the second scarcely to 
be established by a less severe process as purely 
selfevident this is assuredly not the way in 
which the foundation of weighty and comprehensive 
theories ought to be laidf

erroneous conclusions 


 


of the third error in our list we have a striking 
instance almost equally instructive in its logical 
results although less momentous in its practical 
consequences in the great fallacy which forms the 
basis of berkeley’s celebrated theory of vision a 
more decided case of the assumption of purely 
imaginative facts as real and incontrovertible pre 
mises can scarcely be adduced from the records of 
philosophical speculation the false step in question 
is committed in the second paragraph of his essay 
in which with a perfect unconsciousness of what he 
is doing he converts distance an abstract term 
into a material line and represents it as both the 
patient and the agent of physical operations which 
are of course wholly fictitious 

as this passage however will form the subject of 
particular comment in an appendix to the present 
treatise it is needless after quoting it below to do 
more here than point out the general character of 


question is recommended to consult mr doubleday’s “ true 
law of population” and an able tract by mr hickson first 
published in the westminster review entitled “an essay on 
the principle of population” containing in my opinion the 
justest view of the subject yet given to the world and re 
markable for its abstinence from hasty generalisation the 
besetting sin of mr malthus 

 “ it is i think agreed by all that distance of itself and 
immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line directed 
endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of 
the eye which point remains invariably the same whether 
the distance be longer or shorter”

the fallacy which it contains and its position in the 
very van of his logical forces 

such instances as these strikingly show the ne 
cessity of scrutinising the doctrines of even the 
most eminent philosophers in their very origin as 
well as exemplify the prevalence and importance of 
those errors which lurk in ambiguities of language 
unwarranted generalisations and assumptions of 
fiction for fact 

whoever attentively reflects on these examples 
and on the suggestions regarding them which have 
been offered in the present chapter will probably 
agree with the author that although the first two 
causes of fallacy extensively prevail yet the greatest 
revolution remaining to be produced in human 
thought will arise from a diminution of the last 
mentioned source of erroneous conclusions or in 
other words from an examination of propositions 
expressive of facts assumed without any evidence 

the progress of physical science may be looked 
upon now as secure in this department of know 
ledge the human mind has succeeded in placing 
itself on the right track and although some im 
provement may be effected in the exact expression 
of abstruse scientific principles what chiefly remains 
to be done is to go forward from the points already 
attained to the investigation of facts hitherto 
overlooked or not yet brought to light or not suf 
ficiently examined with all the aid supplied by 
the exquisite instruments and subtle methods of

calculation invented by modern ingenuity tlie 
proper mode of proceeding is here insured by such 
illustrious examples of successful investigation 
that the necessity of rules and formulas is almost 
superseded but in morals metaphysics theology 
and politics with all subjects belonging to social 
science not comprehended by those terms and i 
may add in the science of medicine a different 
aspect of affairs presents itself here there are 
innumerable gratuitous and baseless assumptions 
received with entire faith as unquestionable and 
almost selfevident first principles of the ground 
lessness of which no suspicion is entertained 

these are often mixed with truths and the 
various deductions from both being perpetually 
intermingled with the original data and with each 
other the result is a chaos of opinions from which 
in moments of speculative despondency it seems 
to the philosophic mind impossible for the human 
race to be extricated 

the only method of extrication is for the in 
quirer to allow no facts no propositions no doc 
trines no principles or whatever else they may be 
called to pass before him on any question which 
he has undertaken to examine without scrutinising 
their character and carefully investigating the evi 
dence on which they rest or are supposed to rest 
and where there is no evidence at all attempting 
to trace the groundless assumptions to their origin

of those views of the reasoning process which have been 
unfolded in the preceding chapters perhaps the most 
effectual way will be to examine some specimens of argu

productions written without reference to theories or canons

syllogisms or enthymemes specially adapted to exemplify 
the rules and observations brought forward and this has 
its advantages but it ought not to supersede an exami

men in their ordinary discourse and writings to convince 
each other the latter procedure may be expected to 
bring out some points which would have otherwise escaped

appendix 


 


in this demonstration there are six distinct steps of 
reasoning the first and second steps although in ap 
pearance enthymemes are in reality syllogisms having 
the major premises not indeed formally stated nor yet 
suppressed but only referred to as propositions formerly 
proved viz “a straight line falling upon two parallel 
straight lines makes the exterior angle equal to the interior 
opposite one” and “ a straight line falling upon two parallel 
straight lines makes the alternate angles equal” 

the general principle or maxim exemplified by these two 
arguments is the dictum de omni et nullo in the latter 
argument for example the equality of the alternate angles 
abc and bce is not selfevident but proved by the alle 
gation previously demonstrated that all such angles are 
equal 

the third step is an argument not requiring a major 
premise the angles bac and abc having been shown 
to he respectively equal to ecd and bce the first pair 
together are intuitively discerned to be equal to the second 
pair together or to bcd 

to such reasoning indeed a major premise is as we all 
know sometimes appended by citing the maxim forming 
the nd axiom in simpson’s euclid “ if equals are added 
to equals the wholes are equal” but as already explained 
this can bring no confirmation to the argument which is in 
itself perfectly conclusive the axiom cited is only the 
general principle exemplified by the reasoning and when 
introduced as a major premise is a logical impertinence 

the fourth step is also a selfevident argument requiring 
no major premise and exemplifies the same axiom “ when 
equals are added to equals the wholes are equal” or more 
correctly “ when the same quantity is added to equals the 
wholes are equal” 

the fifth step is again an apparent enthymeme with the 
major premise not formally stated but indicated as having 
been previously proved viz “ the angles which one straight

line makes with another on the same side of it are equal to 
two right angles” the general principle exemplified is 
here as in the first and second steps the dictum de omni et 
nullo 

the sixth step like the third and fourth steps is a self 
evident argument not properly admitting or requiring any 
major premise being complete as an enthymeme but it ex 
emplifies a different axiom viz “ things which are equal to 
each other are equal to the same thing ” which is the con 
verse of euclid’s “ things which are equal to the same are 
equal to each other” 

in this demonstration then consisting of six steps of 
reasoning three of the arguments require respectively a 
major premise and three do not the three former exemplify 
the dictum de omni et nullo and the three latter exemplify 
respectively a mathematical axiom

analysis of a passage in burkes letter on the french 
revolution 

the next specimen of argumentative composition which 
i purpose to examine is a passage from burke requesting 
the reader to bear in mind that it is not my design to 
discuss the validity of the reasoning although i may 
hazard incidental remarks on that point but to exhibit the 
nature of the various arguments adduced 

it may be useful to observe before quoting the passage 
that there is one very marked distinction between mathe 
matical and what is usually called moral reasoning or 
rather argumentative composition on moral and political 
topics in the former no proposition which is not self 
evident is introduced without being proved the latter 
on the contrary often abounds with mere assertions as well 
as arguments presenting the two so intermingled that it

is not always easy to separate them the reasoning 
moreover is not seldom elliptical disjointed and irre 
gular so that both skill and patience are required to 
reduce it into a definite shape and proper order the 
portion of argumentative composition which i have now to 
analyse is as follows — 

 “all persons possessing any portion of power ought to 
be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that 
they act in trust and that they are to account for 
tlieir conduct in that trust to the one great master 
author and founder of society 

this principle ought even to be more strongly im 
pressed upon the minds of those who compose the 
collective sovereignty than upon those of single princes 

 without instruments these princes can do nothing 
whoever uses instruments in finding helps finds also 
impediments their power is therefore by no means 
complete 

 nor are they safe in extreme abuse such persons 
however elevated by flattery arrogance and selfopi 
nion must be sensible that whether covered or not by 
positive law in some way or other they are account 
able even here for the abuse of their trust if they 
are not cut off by a rebellion of their people they 
may be strangled by the very janissaries kept for 
their security against all other rebellion thus we 
have seen the king of france sold by his soldiers for 
an increase of pay 

 but where popular authority is absolute and un 
restrained the people have an infinitely greater 
because a far betterfounded confidence in their own 
power they are themselves in a great measure 
their own instruments they are nearer to their 
objects 

 besides they are less under responsibility to one of 
the greatest controlling powers on earth the sense of 
fame and estimation 


 



 


appendix 


the share of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of 
each individual in public acts is small indeed 

 the operation of opinion being in the inverse ratio to 
the number of those who abuse power 

 their own approbation of their own acts has to them 
the appearance of a public judgment in their favour 
a perfect democracy is therefore the most shameless 
tiling in the world 

 as it is the most shameless it is also the most fear 
less no man apprehends in his person he can be made 
subject to punishment 

 and certainly the people at large never ought 
for as all punishments are for example towards the con 
servation of the people at large the people at large can 
never become the subject of punishment by any human 
hand 

 it is therefore of infinite importance that they should 
not be suffered to imagine that their will any more 
than that of kings is the standard of right and wrong 

 they ought to be persuaded that they are full as 
little entitled and far less qualified with safety to 
themselves to use any arbitrary power whatsoever 
that therefore they are not under a false show of 
liberty but in truth to exercise an unnatural in 
verted domination tyrannically to exact from those 
who officiate in the state not an entire devotion to 
their interest which is their right but an abject sub 
mission to their occasional will extinguishing thereby 
in all those who serve them all moral principle all 
sense of dignity all use of judgment and all con 
sistency of character whilst by the very same process 
they give themselves up a proper a suitable but a 
most contemptible prey to the servile ambition of 
popular sycophants or courtly flatterers” 

every one will see that this passage is a most complicated 
piece of reasoning 


 



appendix 


 


as is frequently the case the whole forms one main 
argument and is meant to enforce one main conclusion 
while at the same time it contains within it a number of 
subordinate arguments of various kinds rather loosely put 
together and irregularly expressed 

the conclusion which the writer endeavours to establish 
stated as briefly as possible is that the people in a demo 
cracy stand more in need than princes do of the check on 
their conduct supplied by a deep impression of the principle 
that they are responsible to god for the exercise of tlieir 
power and the sum of the reasons which he assigns for 
it is that they have more complete power with fewer 
social and political checks upon it than princes have 

the conclusion or proposition to be proved is stated in 
paragraph no and the rest of the passage is occupied 
chiefly with showing the checks from which popular 
authority is free 

this main argument is obviously one of those enthy 
memes which can derive no strength or confirmation from 
a major premise in a very abridged form the reason 
ing is— 

the people in a democracy are under fewer social 
checks than princes are 

therefore they stand more in need of the check of 
conscious responsibility to god 

it would be puerile here to obtrude as a major premise 
the general proposition “ all who are under fewer checks 
than princes are or than other persons are stand more in 
need of the check of conscious responsibility to god” this 
is not a true major premise giving cogency to the conclusion 
but it is the general principle or maxim which the argument 
exemplifies or which may be educed from it resembling in 
this respect the axiom “ things equal to the same thing are 
equal to each other” 

in the next argument marked no and subordinate 
to the main one there is a distinct enunciation of a major

premise and there is also an expressed minor immediately 
preceding it varying a little the language but not the 
meaning of this minor and placing them in the usual order 
we have the following syllogism — 

whoever uses instruments in finding helps finds also 
impediments 

princes necessarily use instruments 

therefore their power is by no means complete 

but in drawing this conclusion from his premises our 
author uses an ellipsis in his reasoning the only logical 
inference he could directly draw from them is “ therefore 
princes find impediments” in order to make the reasoning 
bring out tlie actual conclusion recourse must be had to 
another argument which stated syllogistically would be — 
whoever finds impediments has incomplete power 
princes find impediments 

therefore they have incomplete power 

this syllogism is nevertheless of that kind in which 
the major premise is superfluous or in other words imparts 
no force to the argument but is merely a generalisation of 
it let us try this by reducing it to an enthymeme — 
princes in using instruments find impediments 
therefore their power is incomplete 

the force of thfe reasoning here lies in the implication 
of one thing by another as in the case of a mathematical 
enthymeme the argument is in truth an example of 
those inferences already explained in the third chapter 
where the same fact is presented to the mind in two different 
aspects and it is argued that because it is true in the one it is 
true in the other 

the argument numbered has for its conclusion a 
clause tacked to the conclusion of the preceding argument 
viz “nor are they princes safe in extreme abuse” the 
connection in the train of thought appearing to be this 
the power of princes is limited not only by the neces 
sity of employing other men as instruments but by and

danger of an extreme abuse of it to prove his con 
clusion as to the danger he alleges that if they abuse their 
trust they are subject either to be cut off by a rebellion of 
their people or to be strangled by their own janissaries 
thus briefly stated we have the following enthymeme — 

princes who abuse their power are liable to be cut off 
by rebellion or assassination 

therefore they are not safe in the abuse of it 

here nothing would be gained by thrusting in the 
general principle “ no person who is liable to be cut off by 
rebellion or assassination is safe” it is one of those en 
thymemes already described in the foregoing treatise where 
the inference amounts to little more than a variety in the 
expression of the fact stated in the premise 

our author having thus shown that there are certain 
limitations to the power of princes proceeds to intimate 
that absolute popular authority is exempt from such 
limitations although his language is not altogether precise 
or direct to the point instead of having like princes to 
employ instruments the people he says are in a great 
measure their own instruments and they have an infi 
nitely greater confidence in their own power than princes 
have because they have a far better founded confidence 

this last clause which in the extract is numbered 
may be construed as a simple assertion that their greater 
confidence in their own power is caused by their confidence 
being better founded the truth of which as a fact may be 
disputed if it is regarded as an argument we have the 
following enthymeme — 

where popular authority is absolute and unrestrained 
the people have a far better founded confidence in 
their own power than princes have 

therefore they have an infinitely greater confidence 

this is a conclusion however not implied in the premise 
here stated it may be naturally asked is a better founded 
confidence entertained by mankind always a greater con 

o 


 



 


appendix 


fidence and this being a matter of experience to be as 
certained by examining a number of instances the argu 
ment requires a major premise expressing or embodying 
that experience as thus — 

whoever has a far better founded confidence in his 
own power than another person possesses has an 
infinitely greater confidence 

the argument is now completed if you do not admit 
it your objection would lie against the major premise as 
not true and not against the reasoning as inconclusive 
in point of fact the major premise is not defensible it is a 
false law deduced from a partial and imperfect induction of 
instances the most undoubting confidence being frequently 
entertained where there is the smallest foundation for it 
it is scarcely needful to add that the argument with the 
major premise as above given exemplifies the dictum de 
omni et nullo at the same time it must he observed that 
the whole is an instance of contingent under the form of 
demonstrative reasoning 

the next argument to he examined is numbered in which 
the proposition maintained is that the people in a democracy 
are more exempt than princes are from another check — 
“they are less under responsibility to one of the greatest con 
trolling powers on earth the sense of fame and estimation 
for which he assigns as a reason although he does not in 
dicate it by a causal conjunction that “ the share of in 
famy that is likely to fall to the lot of each individual in 
public acts is small indeed” 

here again the conclusion is implied in the premise and 
if a major proposition were introduced it would be merely 
a generalisation of the argument 

argument no is to prove the proposition which forms 
the reason in the foregoing one 

the operation of opinion being in the inverse ratio to 
the number of those who abuse power 

the share of infamy likely to fall on each individual 
is small 


 



appendix 


 


the reasoning here is elliptical but it is demonstrative 
there is a change of terms also to be noted which renders 
the whole less clear than it would be if a uniformity of 
language were observed as in the following version 
of it — 

the share of infamy falling on each individual is in 
the inverse ratio of the number of those who abuse 
power 

therefore the share of infamy falling on each indi 
vidual in a democracy which consists of a large 
number is small 

the only premise in this argument is of the nature of a 
major premise being a general proposition gathered from 
observation and the conclusion is a particular instance 
coming under it the principle exemplified is the dictum 
de omni et nullo as the reasoning is a little complex a 
minor premise might be introduced without puerility and 
the logical dependence of the whole rendered clearer 
to common apprehension by a little amplification 

the share of infamy falling on each individual is in the 
inverse ratio of the number of those who abuse 
power l e if the number is large the share is small 
if the number is small the share is large 

the number of persons in a democracy who abuse 
power is large 

therefore the share of infamy falling on each indivi 
dual is small 

the argument no is short “ a perfect democracy is 
the most shameless thing in the world because their own 
approbation of their own acts has to them the appearance 
of a public judgment in their favour” 

it is scarcely needful to point out that here again 
although the reasoning is somewhat elliptical there is no 
need of a major premise 

argument no is of a precisely similar character “ a 
democracy is the most fearless thing in the world because

no man apprehends in his person he can be made subject 
to punishment” 

tlie next passage exhibits a complication of reasoning it 
consists in fact of two arguments numbered and and 
denoted by the causal conjunctions “ for ” and “ as” the 
conclusion maintained is “ the people at large never ought 
to become the subject of punishment” and the reason as 
signed is “ because the people at large can never become 
the subject of punishment by any human hand ” which 
last proposition is in its turn supported by the reason 
because “all punishments are for example towards the 
conservation of the people at large” 

the first of these arguments no is singular “ the 
people cannot be punished by any human hand there 
fore they never ought” no one probably will contend that 
it will be mended by generalising it for the sake of obtain 
ing a major premise “ whoever cannot be punished by any 
human hand never ought” 

the second argument no is in brief “all punish 
ments are for example to the people at large therefore none 
can be inflicted on the people at large by any human hand” 

this is an instance of an enthymeme consisting of a ma 
jor premise and conclusion to bring it into regular form as 
a syllogism would require the language to be altered — 

all punishments which can be inflicted are for ex 
ample to the people at large 

no punishment of the people at large can be for ex 
ample to themselves 

therefore no punishment of the people at large can be 
inflicted 

the passage no argues that as the people at large 
cannot be punished it is of infinite importance that they 
should not imagine their will to be the standard of right 
and wrong 

here again we have an enthymeme not to be strength 
ened in force by the introduction of a general proposition

the next argument no is somewhat longer and less 
plain it may bo summed up as follows — 

the people are not more entitled and are less qualified 
than kings to use any arbitrary power 

therefore they are not tyrannically to exact from 
those who officiate in the state an abject submis 
sion to their will 

this concluding argument of the extract is manifestly of 
the same character as the last 

the examination of geometrical and moral reasoning 
which we have now gone through may appear tedious but 
it will not be fruitless in confirming the principles of the pre 
sent treatise it shows that both mathematical demonstration 
and argumentative composition such as mankind actually 
employ in appealing to the understandings of each other on 
moral and political subjects abound with reasoning of a 
varied character exemplifying divers general principles or 
maxims and it especially proves that many of the arguments 
employed are at once nonsyllogistic and demonstrative 


article ii 

some suggestions for the examination of argumentative 
composition 

the preceding examination of the nature of arguments 
may be useful to the student of logic by furnishing an 
example of the way in which such an analysis may be ac 
complished it is confined however to exhibiting the 
species and varieties of reasoning while the points of the 
greatest importance to him are the truth of the premises 
and the validity of the conclusion and it has occurred to 
me that a few hints indicating the mode of proceeding to 

o 


 



 


appendix 


investigate these points would form a proper sequel to 
what has already been done they are not designed for 
adepts but for students in logic 

on the supposition then that the student has a piece of 
reasoning or portion of argumentative composition before 
him the following suggestions might be found useful in 
dealing with the arguments seriatim 

 find the exact conclusion sought to be established by 
the writer and state it as briefly but as nearly as 
possible in his own language 

 if the conclusion is obscure or ambiguous endeavour 
to find out what the author meant and if it is doubt 
ful which of two or more propositions he intended to 
maintain examine the argument as suggested in the 
following rules first on the assumption of one and then 
on that of the other or others 

 next find the reason or reasons assigned and state 
them as the writer has done and as nearly as possible 
in his own language stripping them however of 
redundant expressions and irrelevant matter 

 examine the nature of the argument 

a if it is direct contingent reasoning consider well 
whether the facts alleged are sufficient to warrant 
the general law or as the case may be the par 
ticular inference if not sufficient it is needless to 
proceed further 

b if the reasoning is ostensibly demonstrative and in 
the form of enthymemes it may be well when you 
are doubtful whether it is classreasoning or not 
to make it syllogistic by supplying what is called 
the missing or suppressed premise since even should 
the last turn out to be needless you will at all events 
have all the possible propositions before you and 
although needless it must be true if the enthy 
meme is valid when the argument has been thus 
brought into a definite form examine the validity of 


 


appendix 


 


the syllogism and if it is fallacious in consequence 
of confusion or ambiguity in the language or other 
cause mark the fallacy and your task is ended 

 in both the above cases a and b since the premises 
are insufficient to prove the conclusion deduced from 
them it will be well to consider whether a modified 
inference may not be drawn from the facts as stated 
the facts do not bear out the asserted conclusion but 
they may bear out something short of it what con 
clusion do they enable us to deduce 

 suppose however the inference to be valid the next 
step whether the argument belongs to direct contingent 
reasoning or to demonstrative reasoning is to examine 
the truth of the premises or in other words of the 
facts asserted in them the conclusion is warranted 
by the premises but are the premises themselves to be 
relied upon 

 in this investigation of the truth of the premises 
you may possibly find that although the propositions 
as stated by the author are inadmissible yet the 
substance of them is true or at least susceptible of 
being put into a less objectionable shape in such 
cases as your object is not to take advantage of mere 
errors in form but to come at the truth whatever it 
may be throw the argument into the most forcible 
shape in which it can be exhibited and then re 
examine the whole 

 if you satisfy yourself that the premises are erroneous 
and can point out the circumstances which make them 
so it will be useful to trace the source of the error in 
the mind of the writer nothing seems to give us a 
greater command of a subject than to be able not only 
to see the mistakes which have been made regarding 
it but to ascend to their origin 

 see chap xi sect of the preceding treatise

appendix 


 recollect that in many cases although you can 
show an argument to be fallacious the conclusion may 
still be true and all that you have done is simply to 
have placed it in the position of being unproved 

 in order to guard against the obscurity vagueness 
confusion and ambiguity incident to language en 
deavour to conceive when practicable the actual things 
represented by words and when the terms are com 
plex decompose their meaning into its constituent 
parts 

 when the definition of an important word on which 
any of the reasoning turns has been given make it a 
practice in all obscure or dubious passages of the com 
position where it is employed to substitute the defini 
tion for the term if the writer under examination 
has furnished no definition of such a term form one 
for yourself and use it in the same manner 

 when abstract general terms are used in any propo 
sition translate the proposition into concrete language 
and try how the argument in which the proposition is 
employed will be affected by the change 


article iii 

the preceding suggestions in part exemplified by an ex 
amination of berkeley’s celebrated argument to prove 
the impossibility of seeing distance 

for the purpose of exemplifying the principal rules here 
given i will take berkeley’s celebrated argument to prove 
the impossibility of seeing distance it is in his own words 
as follows — 

“ it is i think agreed by all that distance of itself and 
immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line 


digitized 



appendix 


 


directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in 
the fund of the eye which point remains invariably the 
same whether the distance be longer or shorter” 

according to our first rule we have to begin the exami 
nation of this argument by finding the conclusion which it 
seeks to establish berkeley has placed it on the very 
threshold of his treatise — 

“ distance of itself and immediately cannot be seen” 
this conclusion or thesis appears to be clearly and unam 
biguously expressed i shall have in the sequel to object 
to the use here made of an abstract term but for the present 
let us take the proposition as it is given 

we next proceed to comply with the third rule 

the reason assigned for the conclusion is that “ distance 
projects only one point in the fund of the eye ” and in 
proof of this latter proposition a reason is also assigned 
viz that “ distance is a line presented endwise to the eye’’ 
there are obviously here two separate arguments which 
are ostensibly of a demonstrative character and which in 
compliance with our fourth rule we may spread out into 
two syllogisms reversing the order in which the proposi 
tions are presented by berkeley 

first syllogism 

lines directed endwise to the eye project only one 
point in the fund of the eye 

distance is such a line 

therefore distance projects only one point in the fund 
of the eye 


second syllogism 

whatever projects only one point in the fund of the 
eye cannot be seen 

distance projects only one point there 

therefore distance cannot be seen 


 


 


appendix 


looking at these syllogisms agreeably to the latter part 
of our fourth rule i find that they are perfectly correct 
a scholastic logician cannot find in them any nondistribu 
tion of middle terms or illicit processes the language is not 
ambiguous and every one of common discernment must see 
that they are conclusive 

nothing remains then but in compliance with the sixth 
rule to examine the truth of the premises 

it will be obvious to all that the major premise of the 
first syllogism if it has any meaning at all must signify 
material or physical lines if it meant any thing else it 
would be palpably inadmissible since imaginary or hypo 
thetical lines can project no points on the retina the pro 
jection of points or more accurately the images of points 
on the retina is a physical operation and even in this sig 
nification the predicate can be affirmed only of material 
lines stopping short of the eye of a material line directed 
endwise to the eye the end would undoubtedly project a 
point on the retina if it did not approach too near that 
organ but if it entered the eye it would project no point 
at all 

the major premise then is true only if material lines are 
understood and only if such lines stop short of the eye 

hence the minor premise which asserts that distance is 
such a line as is spoken of in the major cannot be admitted 
if distance can be correctly termed a line at all it can in 
ho sense be termed a material line and it would be absurd 
to speak of it as a line not reaching the organ of vision 
but distance cannot in fact be termed a line at all with any 
correctness or even definite meaning although it may be 
measured by a line 

the minor premise being thus shown to be in every way 
inadmissible the conclusion of the first syllogism is not es 
tablished distance is not proved to project even one point 
in the fund of the eye 

the minor premise of the second syllogism being the 


 



appendix 


 


same proposition as the unproved conclusion of the first 
falls equally to the ground and carries the whole syllogism 
along with it 

but if this minor premise were admitted the second syl 
logism must share the fate of its predecessor the major 
premise is not only untrue but the very opposite of the 
truth for whatever projects a point or more accurately 
the image of a point upon the retina must be seen and if 
distance projects such a point which it cannot be said to 
do as the assertion has no real meaning distance must be 
seen 

it has been supposed by some that by lines directed 
endwise to the eye berkeley meant rays of light but if 
we try this supposition we shall only be landed in fresh 
difficulties what can be made of such a proposition as 
“ distance is a ray of light directed endwise to the eye ” 

discarding however any rigid exaction of consistent 
language let us in the spirit of our seventh rule en 
deavour to put the argument in its best imaginable form 

bodies at various distances all send rays of light to the 
eye which rays must of course vary in length with the 
distances now as these rays are all right lines presenting 
their ends to the retina it is plain that the eye cannot see 
the different lengths of the rays nor consequently the 
distances of the objects whence the rays proceed any more 
than if a bundle of rods of various lengths were presented 
to it endwise it could perceive that one rod was longer 
than another 

here we have two consecutive arguments rays of 
light coming from objects present their ends to the eye 
therefore the lengths of the rays cannot be seen inas 
much as the lengths of the rays cannot be seen the dis 
tances of the objects whence they proceed cannot be seen 

in reply to the first argument it may be remarked that 
it is a superfluous undertaking to prove that the lengths of 
the rays of light proceeding from objects to the eye cannot 


 


 


appendix 


be seen since no part of such rays can be seen neither the 
ends nor the lengths they are so far from being seen 
that it is only a small number of mankind who are aware 
that such things as rays of light proceeding from the ob 
jects in view are concerned in the act of vision that the 
lengths of such rays are not perceptible is therefore a 
notorious fact but the second argument goes on to allege 
that as the eye cannot see the various lengths of the rays 
it cannot see that the objects from which the rays come 
are at various distances why not what incompati 
bility is there between rays being invisible and objects 
being seen to be at various distances from the spectator 
here is in fact an assumption of the very thing to be 
proved 

the bundle of rods furnishes no analogous case rods 
are visible objects rays are invisible rods when pre 
sented endwise to the eye stop short of that organ rays 
enter it and fall on an internal membrane the ends of 
rods are external objects which are seen by means of rays 
of light proceeding from them while to say that the ends 
of rays are external objects seen by means of other rays 
proceeding from them would be selfevidently absurd 

it is highly probable to touch upon the inquiry suggested 
by rule that this false analogy between bundles of rods 
or other material straight lines and rays of light originally 
misled berkeley as it has undoubtedly misled some of his 
followers we see clearly how it may have been the 
source of his ingenious but unsubstantial paradox and how 
it may have betrayed philosophers who ought to have known 

 “ how can vision of itself give us any notion of the distance of 
bodies when we know that the light reflected from them falls in 
straight lines on the eye and can present only the ends of these lines 
to the organ you can have no notion of the length of a line by 
being touched merely with one of its ends we could as well know 
the length of a staff by having our yes confined merely to the breadth 
of its head”— youngs lectures on intellectual philosophy p so 
loosely is philosophy sometimes written

better into the mistake of regarding as a question in optics 
what is purely a metaphysical theory 

in the preceding exposure of the unsoundness of 
berkeley’s premises i have not adverted to one circum 
stance which when duly considered is of itself sufficient 
to show their hollowness 

the word distance is an abstract general term such as 
forms the subject of rule and no one has shown more 
forcibly than berkeley himself that nothing can be repre 
sented by such terms but what may be expressed in con 
crete language that there are no real abstract entities 
either physical or mental corresponding to them 

for this reason and not for the reason berkeley assigns 
it may be truly affirmed in one sense that distance cannot 
be seen distant objects may be seen to be distant but an 
abstract quality corresponding to the term distance can be 
neither seen nor even conceived 

his proposition therefore must be translated from the 
abstract into the concrete when it will appear thus 
“ objects at different distances from the spectator cannot 
of themselves and immediately be seen by him to be at 
different distances” 

this is berkeley’s real meaning but when it is thus 
brought out in concrete language the reasons he assigns 
for his conclusion no longer apply as any one will find on 
trial who can bring to bear on the conclusion as here 
translated such propositions as “distance is a line pre 
sented endwise to the eye” and “ distance projects only one 
point in the fund of the eye” 

it may be presumed that at the very early period of life 
when he wrote the “ essay on vision ” he had not attained 
to those clear views of the nature of abstract terms which 
he afterwards gave to the world in the introduction to his 
“ treatise on the principles of human knowledge” other 
wise he would scarcely have fallen into the errors not only of

speaking of that which is denoted by an abstract term as a 
physical or material subject and agent presenting ends to 
the eye and projecting points on the retina but of making 
these imaginary operations the sole evidence of his main 
position 

it is one of those instances abounding in metaphysical 
speculations in which ascribing a real separate existence 
and agency to what is represented by an abstract term has 
contributed to lead philosophers into very remarkable errors 
and to perpetuate the influence of such errors over the 
human mind 

it must be kept in recollection agreeably to our ninth 
rule that the preceding examination of berkeley’s argu 
ment may possibly show only that his conclusion is un 
proved not that it is erroneous in point of fact such is 
the case his alleged premises are shown to be false but 
it is still possible that the proposition which he has at 
tempted to prove by them may be true the reader who 
is desirous of entering further into the question may 
consult two works by the present writer in which it is dis 
cussed at considerable length 

after wading through the preceding directions and 
exemplifications the young student may probably exclaim 
that the examination of all arguments in this way would 
require a vast deal of trouble and there can be no doubt 
at all that to learn to think with accuracy and precision 
does require no small labour but labour which cannot be 
evaded if the object is to be gained he who wishes to 
obtain the power of correct reasoning must pay the price 
there is nevertheless this consolation and cheering pros 

 a review of berkeley’s theory of vision designed to show the 
unsoundness of that celebrated speculation vo 

a letter to a philosopher in reply to some recent attempts to 
vindicate berkeleys theory of vision and in further elucidation of 
its unsoundness pamphlet
