fellow of caius college cambridge and late principal of
bristol college
my dear sir
as it was under your patronage and in the way of
carrying out your plans that i delivered these lectures
i am happy to be allowed to inscribe them to you not
withstanding my strong sense of their deficiencies i am
now induced to commit them to the press solely from
my being unacquainted with any manual which within
moderate compass would bring before my pupils the
topics here treated if they can be of service in pro
moting clearness of thought and reasoning my end will
be attained you have given ybur mind peculiarly to the
improvement of education and are aware that it often
consists chiefly of details on which account venture to
hope you will not be ashamed of your name appearing
in this connection
i have the honor to be
my dear sir
yours gratefully and sincerely

in the form of lectures at bristol college that part
of them which treats of the doctrine of causation may

of preface to that which needed to be said on

unavoidable

large a space would be occupied by the subject
it swelled under his hand and after it was finished

introduction
it has been the lot of most departments of human
knowledge to go through a preliminary state in
which the true science was so obscured by indistinct
doctrines or so stretched beyond its own limits by
pretenders as to prejudice the world against it en
tirely astronomy was once astrology chemistry
was alchymy natural philosophy in general was
magic medicine was witchcraft geology was cos
mogony history was a confused heap of legends
genealogies and superstitious tales geography and
chronology were fanciful schemes framed upon arbi
trary opinion and theory with little or no basis of
facts
when the mist that hung over all these has cleared
away that in which metaphysics and logic are in
volved seems in great measure to maintain its place
it is the reproach of modern metaphysicians as of
the ancient philosophers that one school refutes the
tenets of another so rapidly that to bystanders all
appears like the shifting scenes of a theatre baseless
and visionary not able to repay the pains of him
who shall labour through the multifarious works

logic and metaphysics

composed on the subject the very names meta
physics and logic are enough to scare many their
vagueness inspires disgust so little about them is
supposed to be consistent with common sense as to
make the definition well relished that when a man
talks what nobody understands and what he does not
understand himself that is metaphysics
acceptation of the words logic and metaphysics
i have joined together the two names logic and
metaphysics because they have been united and
often confused from the earliest times both words
are in their derivation so vague that it is hard to
say that they ought to mean any particular thing
logic is derived from aoyoj a word of immense
applicability meaning speech or intelligence or
system or rationale or good sense instead of
logic the classical writers often say dialectics which
means the science of discoursing from aaeyofÃ¢Ã¢
to converse this is equally vague as for meta
physics it is derived from the words xera rd punxd
 after the physics by which some say that aris
totle intended to allege that it was a topic to be
studied after natural philosophy others that he
merely happened to write that treatise after the
other but i have no intention of inquiring how
any of these words ought to be used at least by
reference to their etymology

fields of science



fields of science
the first point of importance towards getting a
clear view of any science is to have accurately
described its object matter and its purpose
by the object matter objecta materies is meant
the phenomena which any particular science contem
plates thus numbers are contemplated by arith
metic magnitudes by geometry the countries of
the earth by geography the heavenly bodies by
astronomy human duties by morals we meta
phorically name these the fields of the respective
sciences they might be called the objects as in
the case of sight c that which is seen is called the
object and he who sees is called the subject but
the word object is ambiguous being applied also to
mean the scope aim purpose of a thing to avoid
which ambiguity the word matter is added
when there is neglect to settle accurately the field
of a science it encroaches on ground that does not
belong to it whence rises confusion and error and
discredit to the science itself thus in the pytha
gorean system arithmetic was made to dictate con
cerning the natural properties of things earthly and
heavenly while aristoxenus of tarentum would
make music the basis of physiology in most culti
vated nations except the greeks and romans who
had no order of priesthood the most extensive and
injurious encroachments have been made by religion
on various other sciences so that the teacher of
religion is supposed to preside over medicine his
tory legislation and politics morals and meta

purpose of logic

physics among the greeks and later romans the
rhetorician unduly obtruded himself on the field of
politics and law nay of the whole assemblage of
the sciences in all such cases the result is a cor
ruption of both the invading and the invaded science
as bacon expresses it concerning religion and natural
philosophy from the unsound mixture there arises
 both a fanciful philosophy and a heretical reli gion
but to fix the nature of a science we must know
not only its field or object matter but the pur
pose which it has in exploring that field for several
sciences often range through the same field chemis
try and medicine both treat of plants and minerals
of liquids and various animal substances but the
one is seeking to learn absolutely the principles of
their commixtion the other is studying their effects
on human health the different purpose or end
in view causes things that are very subordinate in
the one science to be of paramount importance in
the other and alters the whole method of treating
the subject

field and purpose of logic
it is now my business to explain what is the
object matter and what the end in view in the
science which i have in hand and which in con
formity to usage i have called logic although i
have much preference for a name invented i believe
by mr jeremy bentham viz the science of
evidence

purpose of logic



when we take a review of various sciences though
at first they seem to have little in common closer
inspection shows that the methods of proceeding are
in many very much alike insomuch that a person
who has made progress in one often finds others to
be easier on that account for in all there is an
investigation of truth something is being found
out something is being proved something is being
refuted some plausible mistake is being accounted
for it will occur to inquire whether the mode of
proof and the character of the evidence is the same
in all or different and how far different indeed
it may be asked what it is that constitutes proof
and whence or how proofs are likely to be drawn
neither is this to be confined to regular sciences it
applies to all the miscellaneous knowledge and pass
ing arguments afloat in the world the object
matter then of logic is no particular set of phe
nomena parallel in character to that which other
sciences contemplate but is proof or evidence as
such and in discussing evidence the end in view
is to investigate the laws of evidence to lay down
when and why it is that we say a thing has been
proved its evidence is good it is therefore to be
believed
under the term metaphysics and indeed logic
is often understood something quite different viz
an inquiry into the intellectual powers or pheno
mena of the mind at large such a science will
discuss the nature of attention and retention ima
gination invention judgment association and such



purpose of logic

like or again the affections sentiments and active
powers of man the name psychology has been well
used in modern times to distinguish this branch of
inquiry we have at present nothing to do with
such topics except so far as they must be adverted
to in order to exhibit the nature of proof and if
any one urge that our science in this case should
rather be called syllogistics while the term logic
should include an inquiry into the intellectual powers
and psychology into the affections i have no parti
cular objection except that the word syllogism has
been so confined by the aristotelians to a particular
form of proof as will be hereafter shown that the
new name might help to increase the existing con
fusion
in the celebrated treatise on logic by the arch
bishop of dublin the able writer has kept so close to
the scholastic system as to restrict his science to
demonstrative or perfect argumentation the infal
lible deducing of one proposition from others sup
posed to be true in this way probabilities are
excluded as well as in numberless cases the inquiry
why we believe the statements from which we are
deducing others but i can see no adequate reason
for admitting such a restriction in result a new
treatise is wanting to include the important subjects
hereby omitted and instead of seeing aristotle and
bacon woven into a single system the student is led
to suppose them fundamentally in opposition
but logic explained as above to be the science
of evidence generally cannot be struck off by the

utility of logic



powers of the mind reflecting on itself and ignorant
of all things besides and therefore neither will it be
that dry and formal thing which the mere aristotelic
logic is accused of being but it is naturally an
aftergrowth to other knowledge nor would bacon
have attained so much discernment concerning its
general principles had not his mind been already
largely imbued with details of knowledge in nu
merous departments but so far as he has invented
a formal system he has brought us no advantage
while a sound logic was not likely to arise until
knowledge had made some progress it yet did not
need that any systematic science should have arisen 
since it deals with popular knowledge and historical
criticism as truly as with astronomy or chemistry
utility of logic
the first effect of logic is to fortify the knowledge
that has already been attained against the assaults of
unreasonable scepticism such as was the folly of
those ancients who impugned the truth of the senses
as well as of all our moral impressions it thus
secures our basis and strengthens the foundations of
religion itself its next effect is perhaps to point
out objections to certain received arguments or me
thods of reasoning to show weak points which need
to be mended whereby it either leads to a strength
ening of the part or to an abandonment of it as
untenable either result tends to a perfecting of
science finally by commenting on past mistakes
and showing the mode of avoiding them it holds out
beacons of warning to future sciences to keep them



causes that have

from running on the sandbanks from which the old
ones have been with so much effort heaved off the
result of the study ought to be to fortify the mind
alike against too easy credulity and too stiff incre
dulity errors that always go together to habituate
us to analyze our own reasonings and rest more on
the evidence of truth than on mere prepossessions 
also by revealing the sources of error and the means
by which even powerful minds are often entangled
to inculcate candour and modesty as to our own judg
ments forbearance towards those whom we judge in
error
causes that have retarded logic
it is not difficult to see the causes that have re
tarded a just development of the science retracing
all the modern sciences to grecian times bacon has
remarked on the puerile character of the greek mind
which with abundant ingenuity and activity was
wanting in sobriety and practical seriousness yet
it would be hard to say that democritus and anaxagoras plato and aristotle might not under happier
influences have achieved the highest triumphs of
science the state of society and of politics was perhaps
a stronger cause why neither logic nor any special
science made solid progress there was no sense of
justice pervading the community strong enough to
make party evidence suspected and abhorred a
greek court or jury seldom met to investigate
truth but either to be amused and give the award to
the cleverest speaker or to deliver a verdict already
settled in athens mere rhetoric almost of necessity

retarded logic



overbore truth and the rhetorician was supposed to
be a statesman and teacher of politics the dispu
tatious spirit corrupted logic and introduced an
inordinate attachment to mere enigmas and captious
questions it must likewise be remembered that
through the scarcity and dearness of books ancient
literature was generally intended for mere recitation 
an author could not as now calculate on readers 
and large libraries did not exist habitually to pur
chase works of ponderous erudition this was in
itself enough to make literature superficial very
few could attain solid knowledge and those who
possessed erudition could not easily make it available
to others nor gain much credit for it it was in
vain that cicero inculcated by example and precept
the necessity of real acquirements to prevent elo
quence from becoming frothy men can more easily
estimate fine and flashy ornament than sterling
truth and in spite of the superior solidity of the
roman character philosophy having fallen into the
hands of the rhetoricians whose business was to teach
how to dispute on either side came off no better than
from the greeks in the aristotelic school while
logic was defined to be an instrumental art direct
ing the mind in the knowledge of things it ceased
to be an instrument at all being pursued as an end
in itself the remark of bacon ars inveniendi
adolescit cum inventis was illustrated by contraries
because they did not desire and pursue so as to
attain separate truth they did not make progress in
the art of reasoning in fact they added nothing of
value to the system as left by their founder this
b



causes that have

remarkable man justly named thefather of criticism
is a sufficient example to refute the idea that the
greeks were all puerile and superficial yet for more
reasons than one his writings are not calculated to
stamp on his disciples the impress of his own mind
he was essentially a system maker and such persons
in whatever field they appear whether as calvin in
christian doctrine wesley in church government or
bentham in politics and morals throw round their
followers trammels to which they would not them
selves have submitted his ambitious thought is
well expressed by his own words if i can give a
good outline and rough draught any common
person will be able to fill up the deficiency and
thus he has practically doomed his disciples almost
down to dr whately to appear as common per
sons whose credit like that of the working mason
all goes to the architectÃ¢€”again it is hard to say
whether it is from a defect in his mind or whether it
is that his writings were meant only as notes to
lecture from but certainly he is miserably barren of
illustration where it is most needed and he seldom
gives its due prominence to that which is most im
portant all truths seem to lieflat upon his pages 
they want a variety of colouring to bring them out
and show them in their due proportions and distances
hence a reader may fancy that he has thoroughly
mastered a treatise of aristotle while perhaps he has
not at all attained the spirit and purpose with which
it was penned afterwards sometimes when he thinks
he has discovered something new a few short sen

retarded logic



tences show him that aristotle had perceived and
remarked it long ago though the reader had not
understood it before
of all persons the european schoolmen were least
likely to imbibe what was good in aristotle and reject
the evil indeed if i may speak with the second
hand acquaintance which i have of them they seem
to have doted on his least valuable parts to have fed
on mere forms and overlooked his philosophical
truth the reaction produced by bacon has wonder
fully advanced the sciences and has given materials
for perfecting logic as a science but bacon de
spaired of building on aristotles foundation and
thought to sweep away his whole fabric as rubbish
the rival schools seem in consequence to have torn
logic in twain while the baconians are often charge
able with misunderstanding aristotle and underrating
his merits
another cause which since the middle ages has
perverted logic is its unnatural union with theo
logyÃ¢€”the aristotelic philosophy was translated
from greek into arabic and from arabic into latin
the schoolmen instead of studying nature studied
aristotle and adhering slavishly to the greek idiom
contrary to the genius of latin produced a bar
barous technical jargon intelligible only to the ini
tiated thus logic was removed out of the cogni
zance of common sense this was bad enough but
when the science was taken up by divines and incorporated with various christian doctrines many of
them were held to be inexplicable without it perhaps
incapable of being stated soundly without it espe



causes that have

cially the doctrine of transubstantiation which sepms
to have received its final methodical shape from the
hands of the dialecticians of the twelfth century
thus the errors of the schools were consecrated by
religion other doctrines might be named only that
it might lead me off my proper ground hence the
reformers as luther generally treated aristotle as
the stronghold of religious error and abounded in in
vectives against the schoolmen while unable to divest
their own selves of the spirit of the system
even among protestants the divine is often too
apt to make logic practically a part of divinity in
explaining the evidences of christianity and of natu
ral religion c c a variety of arguments become so
current that they are unawares looked on as the
religion itself as are likewise the logical doctrines
advanced to support them i believe this has caused
much injury to the science and still retards it
thus have i stated what logic is what are its
uses and what causes corrupted it until in latter
days it has been thrown aside i will close this
lecture by observing that like arithmetic and geo
metry it is a science of pure mind it does not
stand upon experiments or observation as its basis 
hence it may seem peculiarly fitted to have been
perfected among men who like the hindoo sages
and many of the greeks united great mental activity
to much inactivity of research having that kind of
laziness which would waste hours in speculating how
things must be when a few minutes might suffice to
show how they are if the man would take the trouble
to look but experience shows that even the sciences

eetaedep logic

is

which are grounded upon introspection are never
perfected by such intellects with them geometry
and algebra evaporate into enigmas and conceits
quite as much as logic while morals pass into
mysticism and often turn into immorality it is
the practical intellect such as that of bacon newton
locke franklin paley which is most likely to per
fect even theoretic science



aristotelic division

sect ii
aristotelic division of the subject
the aristotelians regard three operations of the
mind as essential to conducting an argument ap
prehension belief and reasoning which respec
tively take cognizance of terms propositions and
syllogisms
by a term terminus is understood not only a
noun substantive but any collection of words gram
matically equivalent and any set of words which
might stand collectively as nominative case to a verb
as to be thought a traitor is grievous
by a proposition they mean a sentence which con
veys an assertion or a denial and they name propo
sitions affirmative or negative accordingly this
difference is called by them the quality of a propo
sition so that if the question be put what is the
quality of such and such a proposition the reply
is affirmative or negative
by a syllogism they mean a collection of three
propositions of which the first two being given the
third can be assuredly inferred from their com
bination so that in fact in believing the third we
believe no more than is already implied in the first
 it is called by them jxtdicium but as it is meant to express
the reception of a proposition without reference to the grounds
for receiving it i think belief expresses the meaning more
nearly

of the subject



two these two are named premisses and the third
the conclusion as
caesar was a conqueror 
every conqueror is a scourge to syllogism
mankind 
conclusion caesar was a scourge to mankind
some objection lies against the way in which the
 three operations of the mind are spoken of first
it is plain that other operations are needed as atten
tion and memory no man could get through a
syllogism if he forgot the first premiss while dwell
ing on the second again belief has nothing to do
with the process of reasoning for the conclusion
follows from the premisses as well if they be false as
true and reasoning from premisses known to be
false is a matter of daily and important use it may
however be replied that for the moment we as it
were concede the premisses as if believed while we
draw the inference what is perhaps more to the
point although belief has nothing to do with syllo
gism it has somewhat to do with logic for logic
is not confined to mere syllogizing
there is then a triple source of error to which the
mind is liable when reasoning by help of words viz
an indistinct apprehension of terms a false belief
concerning propositions and mistaken inference in
syllogisms it is common to say false inference
for mistaken inference but rigid logicians try to
confine the word false to propositions
the aristotelians speak as though they could
remedy all three defects and in the third they are
triumphant if only the student will himself avoid



on terms

the two first but for the first they can give only
some useful hints and the second they do not even
attemptÃ¢€” to teach a person to avoid false beliefs
would be indeed an arduous affair for a science to
take in hand yet for this bacon has done some
thing in opening to us certain heads of prejudices
or common fancies idold it is well to observe
that some have rather strangely confined the word
 metaphysics to one point viz the inquiry why
we believe any thing about the outer world i
conceive it is a part of logic to inquire both why
we believe our senses and why we believe human
testimony in each avoiding to go so deep as to write
on physiology or ethics so much refers to the
belief of propositions which are not conclusions of
reasoning next to teach us distinctness of appre
hension is impossible but to train us to habits of
close inquiry into the meaning of our words is highly
possible in which however it is probable that geo
metry and the study of a foreign idiom are more
useful than the scholastic logic as for the third
error it is so very rarely committed that we want
no science to guard us from it and it may be safely
said that the scholastic rules on this subject are in
every practical sense utterly useless
on terms
to avoid indistinctness in the use of terms it is
often necessary to check ourselves and inquire what
we mean by them and this is to ask their definition
 i mean after a syllogism has been reduced into form this
will become plainer in the sequel

definition



a definition is a kind of paraphrase but to be of
logical use it should have entire precision if it be
vague it makes worse the defect which it is brought
to remove if it be harder to a particular person
to understand than the word which is to be defined
it is to that person useless and that it may be of
general utility it must be easier to the generality
than the thing defined
definition and explanation differ the latter is
often best given by means of Ã¢–  description if a
foreigner whose tongue we did not understand and
who talked english imperfectly were to ask the
meaning of the word rat the most useful expla
nation might be by describing its properties that it
ate our corn lived in the fields or in the barns and
was of such and such a sizeÃ¢€”because in explanation
we want to convey not so much an accurate notion of
the outermost edge and limit of the field as a vivid
apprehension of the chief parts of it and we trust to
a persons own experience and sympathies to hit on
the thing exactly intended hence description be
longs to the poet who appeals to our sympathies
definition to the mathematician and natural historian
whose first aim is precision
definition say logicians teaches the essence of a
thing they should rather say the essence of a
word or term things have no essence but every
part of a thing is as essential as every other part to
its being what it is it is quite unmeaning to speak
of the essence of an individual object as of john or
thomas or of buckingham house but it is not
unmeaning to speak of the essence of a word as of



definition

the words man and house by the essence is in
tended all the particulars the possession of which by
any individual object is necessary and is sufficient to
justify us in bestowing on such object the name of
man or house and to rehearse such particulars is to
define those names or words
through the imperfection of language few terms
are absolutely fixed in their meaning words are
adopted with reference to the ordinary state of things
among the people who use them or rather they are
relative to the notions of things which happen to be
most familiar hence on a sudden change of circum
stances or influx of new ideas a thousand questions
may rise which had not previously been thought of
as to the applicability of words a pellew islander
suddenly brought to london may justly have de
bated within himself whether it was correct to speak
of horses by the name which he had previously ap
plied to rats so long as the rat was the only
quadruped known to him it is probable that he had
not laid down in his own mind what the name meant
whether the true english in short was rat or qua
druped whatever leads to a wider range of thought
makes a larger and more discriminating vocabulary
important hence in scientific treatises it becomes
necessary to define and sometimes arbitrarily to
limit popular terms as well as to invent new ones
this is peculiarly the case in geometry and the
exact sciences as in so many instances their business
is to demonstrate propositions by means of the defini
tions of words
words may be defined any how without offence to

faults of definition



mere logic if only the person who uses them keeps
always to the sense which he has once affixed to
them but this will not justify any one in widely
and wantonly deviating from common usage it is
inflicting too much on the memory of his readers or
hearers and in spite of all his vigilance he will
himself be liable to fallacy by slipping back into the
popular meaning every needless deviation from
this is an evil we ought to try rather to clear up
popular notions of words and explain to persons
what they mean by them in their brightest moments
but it is better to adopt a new word entirely than
endeavour to wrest an old word to a strange sense
i say it is better meaning of course if the object
proposed be to attain mere perspicuity the case is
otherwise when a sophist desires purposely to darken
his subject or to suppose a less disgraceful case
when mens feelings are to be wrought on or allayed
certain words are consecrated by habit and associ
ations others are become odious and as the mass of
mankind are swayed by these and will not remember
new definitions men are often forced to contend for
the possession of a word and erect mere definition
into what may seem undue importance
faults of definition
a fallacy is sometimes virtually contained in the
very definition of a term viz if parts of a definition
are inconsistent with other parts it is then selfcontradictory or again especially in mathematics a
part of the definition may be superfluous so as to
endanger an assumption that the superfluous parti



investigating definitions

culars necessarily accompany the others when this
ought to be proved not assumed again sometimes
there is a tacit assumption of the existence of realities
such as the word represents on this account there
are many words which ought not to be freely intro
duced and used until after the establishment of cer
tain truths inasmuch as the very word may imply
such a truth and without closest attention lead to
fallacious reasonings thus in defining physiology
to be the science which treats of the actions oc
curring in living bodies nothing is assumed but
if we define it to be the science which treats of the
operation of the vital principle in bodies some
unwarrantable notion may hereby be secretly intro
duced with the term vital principle
on investigating definitions
it is chiefly in science that words are invented to
correspond with previously settled definitions much
oftener the word is made first and has a vague
popular sense and our business is to hunt for the
definition the aristotelians teach two methods of
doing this the first is by putting together known
details as by considering a variety of individual
cases to which we know that the word is applicable
for example if we are asked the definition of the
word city it will occur to us that london edin
burgh bristol oxford york c are all called cities
and by comparing them together we may endeavour
to find what are the particulars which have entitled
them to this name of course we shall here neces
sarily involve the question what is the difference

investigating definitions



between a city and a town which will suggest to
us to examine the case of individual places which we
know to be called towns such as guildford reading 
and enquire why they are not called cities i may
here add that the particular question is a difficult
one and perhaps can only be answered by the past
history of the places if at all this method however
of discussing a definition is to be called the inductive
as it is identical in principle with the process called
induction of which we shall afterwards speak the
object of the enquiry is one of truth and reality
not of words when historical questions are mingled
with it
if i were asked for a specimen of investigating
definitions i should not know to what to refer so
well as to buttmanns lexilogus in a large number
of instances his arguments are not only ingenious
and valuable as elucidating the homeric phraseology
and manner of thought but are highly interesting
and improving as specimens of close and honest
reasoning
the second method of investigating a definition is
called by the schoolmen division though practically
the two are not separated according to this we
first make some large and rough statement obviously
correct as though one were to say that a city is
 the abode of human population and next endea
vour to limit this suitably by asking what sort of
abode the schoolmen teach us to divide thus 
 abodes are of suppose two sorts fenced and
unfenced let us enquire under which of the two
 city falls perhaps we reply under the former 



investigating definitions

which we will name a town well then towns
are to be again divided suppose into those which
possess and those which do not possess a municipal
government and again it is asked under which the
city falls and we reply perhaps that it possesses
such government and so on until we have ade
quately limited the term
now i say this does not really differ from the
former method for how is any one led to constitute
such divisions at all except by looking to particular
cases and how again is he to reply when asked to
which of two heads the word city belongs except by
looking to separate cities and using an induction 
and how lastly is he to know whether the word has
been adequately limited except by trying whether
all or all that he can remember which are called
cities are admitted by his definition and whether all
are excluded by the definition to which the name of
city is popularly refused and in fact the pre
tended division would seem ridiculous to any one
but to a dialectician as it does not at all conduce to
the end in view
after this however it may seem needless to add
what has been dignified with the title of rules of
definition that a definition should neither be too
vague nor too limited should neither admit indi
viduals that ought to be excluded nor exclude such
as ought to be admitted in fact this is no more
than saying that it ought to be true
it will often appear through the imperfection of
language as though various equally good and true
definitions could be given of the same word if the

investigating definitions



sole test of the goodness of a definition were that it
must exclude aright and admit aright then a
cooking animal would be a good definition of the
word man it is certain that all men are capable of
learning to cook may we not add actually do live
on cooked food and as certain that no animals but
men do this yet a little thought shows that when
we call a being a man we do not mean to fix atten
tion on the fact of his cooking propensities for
though when we are reminded that mankind has this
peculiarity we readily assent yet possibly the thought
was new to us we must then reject the definition
as improper in fact if travellers were to furnish
full proof that certain animals exist which really do
cook their food it would never enter our minds that
they ought to be called men there is then a great
difference in the nature of the evidence for the two
following propositions 
man is a child of adam
man is a cooking animal
inasmuch as the former merely expresses b what we
mean or what ordinary people mean by the term
man while the latter tells a truth concerning the
children of adam if this be the case child of
adam rightly expresses the definition which is the
b if any reader uses a different definition of the word man he
must be so good as to look on this as hypothetical and as used
only for illustration if for instance by man he understand
merely rational animal then it is a real truth and matter
of fact that man is a child of adam



investigating definitions

essence of the word while cooking is but a charac
teristic of the species
it will however be observed that in this most
familiar instance there is no real and universal
agreement as to the meaning of terms many french
philosophers disbelieve the scripture account of our
derivation from adam and in their mouth the word
 man is not unmeaning though different from the
sense which we put on it the old logicians con
sider rational animal as a good definition of man 
yet it is hard to prove that elephants do not reason
and it brings us into niceties of distinction which the
popular mind assuredly does not follow indeed if
gullivers story of the reasoning houhnyhymns or
horses were for a moment believed by a credulous
person it would not occur to him to call such crea
tures men even while he believed them to be rational
animals hence reason is at most only a charac
teristic found to distinguish men from other animals 
and does not express the essence of the word man
the above will show what extensive fallacy may
be hidden under the showy plan of setting out with
defining terms inasmuch as the definition is to
be arrived at only by a close and sometimes difficult
analysis of other peoples meaning unless we care
fully keep in view that words are ever varying we
may indeed point out different senses in which a
word is used and then state in what sense we mean
to take it ourselves and this is often of the very
greatest service inasmuch as the false arguments
which deceive half the world are constantly based
on ambiguous words

investigating definitions



terms of science which the writer invents there
is no great difficulty in defining in mathematics
also it often happens that numerous definitions are
equally good at least equally logical forin geometry
or in the pure calculus no results are admitted by
help of observation and testimony but only by
reasoning from the definition hence a sphere for
instance has no characteristics but such as are neces
sarily connected with the essence while the charac
teristics of man or horse are not necessarily thus
connected but only uniformly by which we mean
that as far as observation extends they are found
connected but in geometry if we chose to assume
some of the characteristics of a sphere suppose its
equation to rectangular coordinates as the essence
of the term we could hence demonstrate as a charac
teristic what we had previously named the essence
but this is not the case with ordinary words
thus we are led to consider besides the essence
or true meaning of a word likewise the charac
teristicsÃ¢€”not of the word but of all the individuals
contained under the word it is sometimes conve
nient to employ three appellations characteristics
properties and accidents in contrast to each other
the first expresses what is possessed by all the
individuals to which the word applies and by none
beside the second expresses what is possessed by
d the schoolmen say specific property for that whioh i have
called characteristic and generic property for that which i name
simply property in common language peculiarity is also used
for characteristic
c



investigating definitions

all but by some beside the third expresses what is
possessed by some only or not always by all thus
it is a characteristic or pecu to be capable of forming moral
liarity of man
judgments
 a property
to be gregarious
 an accident
to have six fingers on the hand
the utmost confusion of thought is produced by
logicians when they speak as though the essence
belonged to the very same subject as do the charac
teristic the property and the accident whereas the
essence belongs to the word or name but the other
three to the individuals contained under the word
nevertheless when a word has been used with much
laxity and it becomes desirable for scientific pur
poses to fix its meaning anew the best method is
to select all the characteristics or indeed the proper
ties known to belong to the objects which are popu
larly connected with the word and employ the word
as representing them all together thus the essence
becomes the aggregate of the characteristics or pro
perties so if we wish to define sugar we may say
its essence consists in the combination of sweetness
whiteness a crystalline arrangement and a certain
chemical combination all of which are properties
but it is a characteristic of sugar to unite them all 
and this we may make the essence of the word
sugar yet nothing hinders but that we may after
wards discover new characteristics not included in
the definition thus made
physiologists define life by recounting its main
characteristics but no one supposes that the subject

investigating definitions



is thus exhausted and that all that regards life may
be deduced out of such a definition when such a
notion is entertained the mind is mischievously set
on eliciting truth out of words and not out of
things
an important controversy in morals turns on the
distinction between essence and characteristic it
is allowed by all that virtue taken in the long run
and on the largest scale tends to produce happiness 
and vice to produce misery so that all regard it as
a characteristic and useful test of virtue to tend
towards happiness but the utilitarian doctrine far
ther teaches that this is the essence of the word
virtue insomuch that when we call an action vir
tuous we mean that it is useful on a large scale
the opposite school is confident in alleging that
though we know murder to be a very hurtful practice
yet when we say that a murderer is a wicked man we
mean and feel more than that such acts do not tend
to general happiness
not very unlike is the controversy about the sub
lime and beautiful the same qualities in a horse
are generally beautiful and useful at least tend to
speed yet when we admire a horses beauty mr
burke is certainly right in insisting that we mean
something else than its utility or its speed indeed
here it may be added that numberless blemishes in
beauty are conceivable that neither should diminish
its speed in the particular case nor have any tendency
to do so generally

relative extent of terms
relative extent of terms

of terms or names some embrace a far greater
number of individuals than others not only so but
some will embrace all the individuals that fall under
another and more beside thus fish contains all
which salmon contains and many more in such
case the more comprehensive name is by logicians
called genus the less comprehensive species
thus fish is a genus under which fall a variety of
species as salmon herring flounder c
i say logicians thus use the words genus and
species and accordingly they will equally call ani
mal a genus of which the words beast bird fish
c are species for all that they look to is the
relative extent of one to the other in this way a
term as fish which is a genus compared to some
others less extensive as salmon herring is a
species in comparison with the more extensive term
animal thus a series of terms is conceivable like
a genealogy of which the highest is the most exten
sive and the lowest the most confined and of which
each is to that immediately below it as genus to
species
but it is right to add that the natural historians
have beaten the logicians out of the field by fixing
the words genus and species so that they are be
come no longer merely relative terms thus no
naturalist would think of calling beast a species and
animal its genus but the word species is peculiarly
applied to such a class of animals as either are sup
posed or might be supposed to have descended from

logical division



common parents thus dog cat horse cow c
are species absolutely without naming any genus
again the leopard the lion the domestic cat are
all species under the common genus cat for the 
greater facility of science a series of terms has been
invented ascending and in part descending from
the term species
species subgenus genus family tribe or section or
division order class kingdom
species variety subvariety race or breed
but to go into details on this subject would be to
trespass on the domain of natural history

logical division
if we speak of dividing a thing the obvious mean
ing is to effect a real or mental distribution of phy
sical parts as of a man into head body and
limbs this is sometimes called physical division
if we speak of dividing a word as man logically
this naturally implies distributing the individuals
contained by it under subordinate heads as man
into civilized and savage thus a genus is resolved
or divided into certain component species obvious
rules for such division are that the parts be exclusive
of each other and that the parts together make up
the whole in other words that every individual
contained under the original term be also found
once but once only under those which are substituted
for it
but it is well just to advert to another kind of



logical division

division sometimes called metaphysical on con
sidering that all that are contained under a species
are also contained under its genus though not all
that are contained under the genus are under the
species it appears that there is more meaning in the
word that is species than in the word that is genus
to it as more meaning in the word fish than in the
word animal thus a fish is an animal and some
thing more this something more is called the
specific difference because it distinguishes fishes
from other animals which are not fish that is
from all the cognate species and now it is said
that genus is made up of species and specific dif
ference and divisible into the two thus if ration
ality be the specific difference between man and all
other animals animal is said to be divisible into man
and rationality but in fact it is not here an animal
that we are dividing as in physical division nor
are we classifying the individuals contained under the
word animal as in logical division but it is the
definition of the word animal which is undergoing a
physical division for such division goes upon the
supposition that we may define man as meaning
rational animal superadding the specific difference
to the genus
this is the only definition which the aristotelians
admit as radically valid
the truth is that as
genera or classes may be formed arbitrarily no
definition is conceivable at all which might not be so
resolved thus if man be defined child of
adam it may be alleged that kinsman of adam
is genus while child points to a specific dif

logical division



ference true adam had no other kinsfolk but
this is accidental only again child of an animal
might be called a sort of genus and adam might
show the specific difference once more if we
define a mayor as being the president of a muni
cipality one logician may tell us that officer of a
municipality is the genus and that president
marks the specific difference while another may
contend that president of an association is the
genus and that the specific difference lies in the
word municipality but the definition certainly
marks out neither genus nor specific difference but
ingenuity is to be tasked to resolve it as best we
may perhaps awkwardly and uselessly yet in the
aristotelian system much stress is generally laid on
this point for which reason i have thought right
briefly to explain their nomenclature
thus if they ask what is a thing or rather a
term a name they expect that the reply will be by
stating the genus what is man answer an
animal again what sort is he answer by the
specific difference rational thus to t the quidditas of the schoolmen is the genus and to wolfo ti
the quale quid is with them the specific difference
various other points of latin nomenclature have
been introduced by them with which it is not worth
while to trouble ourselves

propositions
on propositions

i have already stated that propositions are divided
by logicians into two classes affirmative and negative
but this division has reference only to the mode of
making an assertion and not to the substance or
meaning for the very same assertion may be dif
ferently worded so as to become as we please af
firmative or negative sometimes by a slight change
such as that of not deserving into undeserving
 not just into unjust a proposition passes from
negative to affirmative sometimes it is accompanied
with an entire alteration of the structure
on this account it would seem that the present
division of propositions more properly belongs to
grammar than to logic since logic must look to
the meaning of an assertion and not to the mode of
conveying that meaning of course every propo
sition admits of numerous changes of form without
altering the substance of the meaning both by inter
changing synonymous words and by minor gram
matical alterations or even by translation into a
foreign language with which we need not now con
cern ourselves but there is one form to which
logicians generally choose to reduce their propo
sitions viz so that there may be three portions of
which the central and connecting part is a tense of
the verb to be the first part being then that of
which something is said and the third part that
which is said of it thus
william was brave
the king is apprehensive of it
some courtiers were disposed to flatter
few men of principle are willing to give their names

ljioiositions



in such cases we call the first part the subject the
second part the copula and the third part the
predicate the subject and predicate are of course
terms the word term terminus being indeed
hence derived because they are the extremities or
opposite ends of a proposition
it will be readily seen that all propositions that
are not already of this form are easily reducible to
it as
cthe consul bad learned the consul had been apprized
 the enemy drew nigh the enemy was drawing nigh
few exceed this height few are higher than this height
farther in place of the various tenses of the verb
to be in the copula we may manage to substitute
uniformly the present tense thus instead of in
quiring whether hannibal was ever defeated in
italy we may inquire if it was ever true to say
 hannibal is defeated in italy instead of the
assertion that a revolution will take place we
may allege that it will be hereafter true to say
 a revolution is taking place or is past thus
the idea of time is removed from the copula and
thrown on the sentence at large or on the assertion
which introduces it
the same method may be used with various ad
verbs that appear in the predicate as for
c philosophers are i sometimes mistaken
 the orators were probably bribed
it is allowable to set down
it is sometimes true that philosophers are mistaken
it was probably true that the orators are bribed
c



ljmjpositions

propositions so qualified are called by the school
men modal and those which are not encumbered by
any qualification categoric but we are not likely
to use these terms any more especially as they are
not understood beyond the pale of the schools
the first and second person in grammar can of
course be evaded by introducing the name of the
person hence the copula is always reducible to
the word is or are putting s and p for subject
and predicate every proposition is said to have the
following form s is p
when however the particle not is detached from
the predicate and united to the copula the form
is as follows s is not p and this is what logicians
call a negative proposition
to obviate misconception let it be kept in mind
that language is not essential to belief a proposition
is but a representation of an act of belief which act
may subsist without the representation just as the
notions which words represent may subsist without
the words even a brute animal has numerous
mental propositions so to say thus a dog on
meeting a person who yesterday gave him a bit of
meat recognizes him which shows a belief that may
be expressed by the proposition
this is he who yesterday gave me meat
nor need we restrict the remark to propositions in
which the subject and predicate are coextensive and
interchangeable there is no doubt that a dog dis
tinguishes by the eye an animal of his own species
as also one of the human species from other objects

propositions



thus when a lost dog supplicates a person never
before seen to become its master it shows an under
standing and belief of the proposition
this personage is one of the human species
but whether an act of belief be or be not repre
sented in language there must in all cases be some
thing about which we have the belief and some thing
which we believe about it and these are subject and
predicate
when however language is employed instrumentally it is requisite before an act of belief is possible
first to know what the arbitrary symbols mean
persons have grievously perplexed this plainest of
truths by the vague dogma that we believe many
things which we cannot understand if this mean
that we can and do believe many propositions with
out knowing numerous matters connected with the
phenomena spoken of it is no doubt true thus we
believe in the circulation of the blood i e the pro
position that the blood circulates without un
derstanding the cause of the circulation but assuredly
not without knowing what the proposition means
it is common to say that we believe our own
existence without understanding it this probably
means that each of us believes the proposition 
exist without understanding how we exist how life
is sustained c but certainly no man believes the
proposition except in the sense in which he under
stands it and if he have no understanding of it he
has positively no belief in it he may indeed trust
the authority which promulgates it but this is not



propositions

to believe the proposition itself thus if a credible
witness were to inform us that the electric balance
is at an equipoise the words being unintelligible to
us we should not believe the proposition itself but
another proposition viz that he has told us some
thing true
it is a perversion of words to call this a belief of
the proposition at all but if it is to be so called we
should imitate the precision of the romish doctors
and call it implicit faith according to their
nomenclature if the church teaches a dogma a man
who rightly understands and believes it has explicit
faith but a man who misunderstands but means to
believe what was intended has implicit or virtual
faith in that which he ought to have believed
many of them hold that this has all the merit of
explicit faith but none can deny that its effects are
widely different if i tell a man that his house is
on fire and he believes me he will probably run
for the engines but if he do not understand he may
have implicit faith in so far as he believes that
 whatever i say is true but he will remain quite
inactive in fact it is only confusion of thought or
love of some hypothesis that could lead any to say
that he believed at all until the proposition was
understood and when he supposes that he under
stands he then believes not the real meaning but
the meaning which he attaches to it
besides the general division of propositions ac
cording to quality into the two forms s is p and
s is not p there is a second division of them accord
ing to quantity as logicians term it that is ac

pkopositions



coiding as the words all or some are understood
to belong to the subject the statement men
are mortal we understand to mean that all
men are mortal but if it be said women are
easily deceived the sense probably is that some
women or most women are easily deceived ac
cordingly propositions are named universal and
partial
in common use a distinction is drawn between
universal and general as when we say that a pro
position is generally true though not universally
but in the phraseology of the schoolmen whatever
is short of being universal is called partial whether
it be expressed by most or many or some or a very
few if a mind were to be regulated by the sole laws
of pure dialectics as taught in the syllogistic system
it must resolve not to understand the difference of
many and few or rather the words themselves are
too vague to be admitted thus a pure syllogizer
would look on the two statements that most men
are liars and very few men are liars as mean
ing the same identical thing both being merged
under the vaguer proposition that some men are
liars
negative propositions may of course be either
universal or partial but in the universals the word
all might sometimes involve ambiguity thus to
say that
all men are not perfect 
for all men are imperfect 
would be obscure and seem rather to mean that not

propositions



all are perfect eastern languages indeed and the
new testament greek use this form as
xloira ffattfe til tmmnnuÃ¢€”
all flesh shall not be justified 
for no flesh shall be justified
after this remark it will be seen that logical pro
positions resolve themselves into four different forms

univeisals
partials

affirmative

negative

all x is y

no x is y

some x is y

some x is not y

these four are technically denoted by the letters
a

e

i

o

some sentences appear in a deceptive form owing
to the addition of the adverb only or the phrase
none but as only natives could bear the fatigue
or none but natives c these we may exchange
into the forms all who are able to bear the fa
tigue are none but natives but the remark is
here introduced only to obviate questioning and
possible perplexity
for a like reason i add that when a proper name
is the subject of a proposition or a word accompanied
with the definite article or demonstrative pronoun
as socrates bacon the historian that country
the proposition is named universal by the schoolmen

propositions
this is disagreeably and inconveniently opposed to
popular usage in which such a proposition is named
particular in contrast to universal and general
but argue they it is universal because when we
say socrates we mean all that the word socrates
implies and to their technical system it is found
convenient so to look at the matter but as we need
not embarrass ourselves with the subject this will not
be any more adverted to by me
mutual relation of propositions
any four propositions related as in the table just
drawn up when any sets of words are substituted
for x and y have certain contrasts and connexions
of meaning dependent on their form alone which
the aristotelians call their opposition
 it is manifest that to assert the universal is to
assert the partial and something more so that to
assert a or e is to assert i or o
hence to deny even the partial amounts to deny
ing also the universal that is to deny i or o
involves a denial of a or e
such is the relation of subordinates i and o being
named subordinate to a and e
Ã¢° to assert a universal affirmative is to deny a
partial negative as to allege that all men are
sinners is to deny the assertion that some men
are not sinners such propositions are called con
tradictory to each other so also of the universal
negative and partial affirmative thus a is contra
dictory to o and e to i



propositions

two contradictories can be neither true together
nor false together but if one is true the other is
false and if one is false the other is true
in the demonstrations of euclid what is named
indirect proof or reductio ad absurdum consists
in proving the falsehood of the contradictory in
place of the truth of the proposition itself as
instead of showing that any two lines of such a
nature are equal he will show that it is false to
allege that some two lines of such a nature are
not equal
it is important to remember how we arrive at a
conviction that two propositions are contradictory 
viz not by considering the matter or topic treated
but the mere form as this very plain subject has
been obscured by false philosophy it is requisite to
elucidate it in a manner that would otherwise be
superfluous to any tolerably clear head when we
pronounce that the proposition all dogs may be
trained to hunt is contradictory to some dogs
cannot be trained to hunt we do not ground our
assertion on any peculiarity in the nature of the dogwe do not lay claim to the experience of sportsmen
we should not appeal to a huntsman or to a natural
historian to confirm what we say we should not
even recur to a dictionary to settle the meaning of
the words but it is manifest that if dogs were
changed to wolves and hunt to bark it would not in
any way affect the case the contradiction is as
certain and as manifest if even x and y be substi
tuted for dogs and hunt nothing ought to be said
or can be said truly in defence of our assertion that

propositions



the two propositions are contradictory than that
human language is an arbitrary thing and that
words and grammar have been so constructed as
that when we assert the one we intend to denote the
same state offacts as when we deny the other
let us suppose a gnostic teacher full of the
absurd mysticism of his sect to set before us two
sacred truths as he viewed them
ah the eons existed from eternity
some of the eons had no existence till after adam
expounding as we should expound after adam to
mean not from all eternity we should pronounce the
relation between the propositions to be that of a to
o and consequently that they contradict each other
if the philosopher alleged that we misunderstood
the term eternity
if he somehow qualified its
meaning so as to prevent our reducing the propo
sitions to a and o if for instance he alleged
that eternity only meant ancient times so that
after adam was not equivalent to not from eternity 
the propriety of his remark would need to be judged
by those learned in the doctrines of his sect a mere
logician would have no right to pronounce upon the
subject but if our gnostic fully admitted that our
reduction of the second proposition was legitimate
what would be thought of his folly or madness in
endeavouring to uphold them simultaneously and to
overbear our modesty by descanting upon our igno
rance of the matter treated on he might doubtless
find a vast field for declamation concerning the
mysterious nature of jsons the incomprehensibility
of eternity human ignorance the need of revelation

ritorositions
the importance of humility the inferiority of logic
to divine knowledge and the presumption of those
who would judge the revelation of god by their own
puny intellects and through such misplaced re
marks he might deceive nine hearers out of ten by
conveying an entirely false apprehension of our ob
jection he supposes or pretends that we are laying
claim to an extensive or precise acquaintance with
the object matter of which he treats no such
thing the form is the seat of the contradiction
as well might the huntsman or the natural historian
in the case before supposed browbeat the student
who should pronounce that if it was true that all
dogs can be trained it is false that some cannot be
trained as the mystic thus overbear by the weight
of his subject one who really professes no acquaint
ance with it whether things earthly or heavenly
present past or future be treated matters not after
the form has been settled the mere logician then
decides at a glance unerringly and without appeal
were it otherwise no mystic could ever be con
futed though he contradicted himself ever so often 
nor could we ever assail a false religion at all
a mohammedan a brahmin a buddhist could all
talk in this high strain and abash us by an appeal
to our ignorance and littleness if on any topic it
is not lawful from the truth of ae to infer the false
hood of then on such topic the human mind can
apprehend nothing at all and if for a moment any
e in strictness it is no inference at all but only another way
of saying the very same thing he who alleges a and 
simultaneously does but say and unsay

propositions



religion could be supposed of such a kind it would
be impossible to know what any of its assertions
meant or what we meant in saying that we believed
them the subject would be manifestly such as the
mind could take no cognizance of whatever and as
we would not endure such dogmatic assumptions from
others in the cause of what we believe to be error
neither must we use it ourselves in the cause of truth
but it is important to distinguish physical from
logical contradictions that a man is at london
and that the same man is simultaneously at york
are physically contradictory but not logically until
it shall have been shown that a man cannot be in
two places at once without which the two propo
sitions are not reducible to any form of logical
contrast again if one witness deposes that a man
was at london at such a time and another that he
was at york twelve hours after we may popularly
say that the witnesses contradict each other because
we know of no method of locomotion rapid enough
to verify both statements the difficulty is physical
the contradiction if such only physical here
would be room for the intervention of a miracle
divine power might effect it the question is not one
of logic but of religion of morals of historical
experience c whereas in the case of logical
contradictions miracles are unavailing since it is the
form not the matter which is refractory a mis
understanding of terms often produces apparent con
tradiction when an uninstructed person hears a
mathematician speak of asymptotes or lines which
never meet though they perpetually approach each



propositions

other and come nearer moreover than any distance
that can be named he generally pronounces that
this is impossible or selfcontradictory the reason
is that he understands lines to meet when they
appear to the eye to meet but the mathematician
addresses the mind not the eye and if between two
lines there were conceived to intervene one billionth
part of the least visible distance he would no more
allow that the lines had met than if they were as far
apart as the earth and sun
the only attempt that can be made to reconcile
logical contradictions is by supposing ambiguities of
expression for all x is y is not truly contra
dictory to some x is not y if there is some
change of sense in the symbol x or y in passing
from one proposition to the other but until we
have ascertained the accurate meaning of the terms
in each case both propositions remain a dead letter
to us if their truth is guaranteed to us by any high
authority we need an interpretation from the same
authority suspicion has now been thrown on the
ordinary sense of the words or rather it is fully
ascertained that one or other we know not which
of the four terms does not bear its ordinary sense
while as yet we know not what sense instead it does
bear for the present therefore the two propositions
are as it were in a foreign dialect and are waiting
for translation
this leads me to remark on the term nonsense
which is properly applied to sentences which do
not perform the office of a sentence viz convey
meaning to the mind they may contain valuable

pro positions



truth but till the understanding knows what it
is they are nonsense the source of this is
st ignorance of words as if any technical or
foreign names are contained dly metaphors ill
understood or other figures of speech sdly bad
or misunderstood grammatical inflexion or syntax 
thly when one part of the sentence apparently
unsays another part while any such apparent diffi
culties exist it is perfectly useless to enforce the
proposition by authority human or divine inter
pretation is first imperatively needed
Ã¢° analogous remarks to those made on contra
dictories are applicable to the universal affirmative
and universal negative these are named by logi
cians not contradictory but only contrary to each
other they cannot be true together but may be
false together
but the partial affirmative and partial negative
are entitled subcontrury these can be true together
but cannot be false together the appellations subcontrary and with the above definition contrary
are unknown beyond the immediate precincts where
aristotle is studied
Ã¢° propositions are said to be reverted in latin
it is called conversio when the subject and pre
dicate are interchanged only the partial affirmative
and universal negative can be thus reverted without
affecting the sense as

of the sentence so that no peculiarity in the object

matter can justify a man in holding one of these
propositions and denying its reverse when the re
verse is merely the same thing said in a different
way finally it may be remarked that a diagram
is not without its use to represent the four kinds
of propositions by which at a glance their mutual
relations are seen and also as will be said below all

on verbal truths
in speaking of definition we remarked that the
truth of a definition was a question not of fact but of
words except in so far as the inquiry is involved
how men use certain words thus to allege that
 a mayor is the chief magistrate of a corporation is
but a verbal truth but the remark would apply to
many propositions beside which do not appear in the
exact form of a definition though they are yet proved
to be true by the mere definitions of certain terms
which they contain thus that thought is an ope
ration of the mind that ugliness is not beautiful
that the sublime is not ridiculous that tall men
are not short these are truths which all will admit

verbal truths



but no one proves them by appealing to experience 
no one appeals to metaphysicians to establish the
first to painters for the second poets for the third
or tailors for the fourth the appeal is not to facts
or history but to the meaning of words if there be
any question at all it is one of lexicography what
means thought ugly tall short c
another species of verbal truth is verified by the
mere form of a sentence we have just seen that
 the truth of any proposition implies the falsehood
of its contradictory this very thing is a verbal
truth verified by the definition of the word contra
dictory but we may propose the same thing differ
ently thus 
 if it be true that all x is y it is false that some
x is not y and the proposition is now verified by
its form in conjunction with the sense of the words
true false c sometimes the form may be purely
grammatical thus the proposition
 he who is a prisoner is under imprisonment 
 he who is dead must have died 
would be verified rather by a grammar than by a
dictionary but in any case there is this difference
between real truths and verbal or as they are
also called identical truths that the notion con
tained bv each of the two symbols x and y are
identically the same in the latter case while in the
former case x and y are representatives of notions
quite distinguishable by the mind which yet as a
matter of fact are found in company thus man
is mortal is a real truth if a truth at all because the



verbal truths

mind can conceive of a man or child of adam with
out simultaneously conceiving of mortality as com
prehended in the definition that a horse is an
animal may be verbal or may be real according as
it is understood to the popular mind it is probably
verbal because by horse they understand any one
of a wellknown class of objects and by an animal
any one of a certain larger class that contains the
former each word having been originally constituted
upon a generalization through which the mind passed
but perhaps a philosopher means by the word ani
mal that which lives by help of respiration and if
so it is a real truth to allege that a horse is an
animal since the popular idea of horse does not
involve that of respiration respiration is rather
a property of the class than a part of the essence
of the word
examples of verbal truths
the whole is equal to the sum of its parts
if the universal be true the partial is also true
five times four is twenty
there is no effect without a cause
every son must have had a father
there is no action without an agent
if he has been murdered some one has murdered him
equal and opposite forces neutralize each other
it is often a source of most subtle fallacy when
a verbal truth is mistaken for a real one or the
converse and owing to the ambiguities of words
the same proposition is sometimes each according
as they are understood a very common sophism

verbal truths



among the dialecticians was to assume under the
guise of a verbal truth one which is no truth at
all as
a man who has got drunk is a drunkard 
where the grammatical derivation of the word drunk
ard imposes on the mind
a wellknown jocose saying may usefully fix on the
memory the importance of attending to this subject
treason never prospers whats the reason 
why when it prospers none dare call it treason
on hearing the first words treason never prospers
we take them for the assertion of a real truth and
expect a proof to be offered from history and the
fact to be accounted for from analogous topics
but the latter part sets about verifying the pro
position by the definition of the word treason 
putting such a sense on the word as verifies the
proposition independently of all history thus the
truth becomes merely verbal when verbal truths
are thus nugatory or deceptive we often call them
truisms which title is also given to very obvious
real truths when they are proved by some elaborate
process
yet it must not be supposed that verbal truths
are always useless they are often serviceable to
remind men of the meaning of their words especially
when words have been invested with a moral import
for good or bad verbal truths therefore serve the
same purpose and are susceptible of the same
unfair use in the cause of fallacy as definitions
being indeed either definitions in disguise or ded



verbal truths

ductions from definitions for example an orator
who was pleading for the english poor under the old
poor law might have taken advantage of the sym
pathy felt by his audience with slaves and their
horror of the word slavery by reasoning as follows 
 english laborers are bound to the soil and are
forced to work for taskmasters at wages which those
taskmasters appoint now those who are in such a
state are slaves nothing else than slaves i say
then that while england is boasting of her freedom
the mass of her laborers are held under slavery
here the proposition in italics is verbal and is
introduced to justify the transition from the pre
ceding to the following mode of stating the same
thing it can do no more than alter the mode of
statement yet the change is not unimportant for
the word slavery will often produce an effect which
could not else have been attained yet in part this
may be taxed with fallacy for while the imposition
complained of is manifestly inconsistent with free
dom yet the burning of mind against slavery of
which advantage is taken has been produced by a
state of things infinitely worse than and essentially
different from any thing to which english laborers
are subjected or are tending
by way of farther illustration i will put forward
several other propositions
Ã¢° motion takes place in the direction in which
an unimpeded force acts if we have no means
of testing the direction of the force nor the fact
of its existence but by the motion and its initial
direction the proposition is a verbal truth if how

verbal truths



ever the force be a pressure whose existence and
direction is ascertainable separately from the motion
of that which is acted on the truth is real
 men always act upon the strongest motive
which at the time urges them if we have no mode
of ascertaining what is the strongest motive at any
particular time except by observing which prevails
the proposition is a truism equivalent to saying that
 they always act according to the motive according
to which they do act if any absolute measure of
the strength of motives is resorted to the proposition
is beyond doubt highly disputable perhaps entirely
false
Ã¢° the will of god is holy just and good
this is of all truths the most intensely important
if the words holy just good have an absolute sense
drawn from the ordinary apprehensions of mens con
sciences but if we have no test or measure of their
sense except by an appeal to the will of god the
truth evaporates into a truism which a worshipper of
moloch would hold
Ã¢° the same causes under the same circum
stances uniformly produce the same effects this
is an assertion which in the material world has been
so extensively verified as to lead modern philo
sophers to an almost unhesitating belief of it
but in the mental world where the causes that
are at work have or seem to have a selfadjusting
power within certain limits it becomes almost im
possible to estimate the intensity of the causes
except by the effects and the proposition is in
perpetual danger of being turned into a truism 
d 



mathematical truth

viz when we so interpret or modify our apprehen
sions of the cause by looking to the effect as to
verify it forthwith
on mathematical truth
it will now be very evident that the simplest
truths of arithmetic are verbal thus that two
and two make four for if we substitute in the
place of two and four their definitions the sentence
becomes one and one and one and one make one
and one and one and one which is identical and
we farther observe that even those which are less
obvious are equally identical for although the
truth that is less obvious than that
 it is really resolvable in the same way
so also the multiplication table is nothing but a
series of identical propositions or verbal truths and
the like holds of a table of powers and roots or of
logarithms
demonstration in such cases consists in a perpetual
substitution of one set of words for another which
is equivalent until the matter is reduced to some
proposition that is manifestly identical it tends
to simplification if a proposition is broken up
into several thus instead of substituting terms
manifestly equivalent we may substitute such as
have been already proved equivalent which are
therefore manifestly equivalent to the practised
mathematician though not to the beginner or
again instead of reducing the proposition to be
demonstrated to a proposition manifestly identical

mathematical truth



it may be reduced to one already proved identical
did we not thus use subsidiary propositions our
labor would be enormously multiplied as we should
have to go through the same process a thousand
times instead of once for all
it ought not to excite astonishment that so much
pains is needed to establish mere verbal truths when
we consider how much thought is requisite to perform
a sum of long addition to one who has no technical
rule to help him when therefore words of so very
complicated meaning are introduced as root expo
nent integral differential it is not wonderful that
much close attention and persevering thought is
requisite to demonstrate propositions that involve
them
nor yet must it be forgotten that there is a large
exercise of other powers of mind as judgment and
invention when it is required not merely to follow
a computation or proposition already finished but to
find out something required the mere faculty that
understands identical propositions to be identical or
the clearness of head which perceives that such and
such a set of words means the same as another set
would never have enabled any one to invent a rule
for extracting the square root much less for invent
ing solutions of higher problems in which all the
resources of the mind are frequently drawnon
yet while the faculties exerted by the original
mathematician are not to be depreciated the truths
which he elicits are for no other reason certain and
eternal as they have been proudly called than
because they assert nothing about matter of fact



mathematical truth

they merely exact that human language shall be
consistent with itself and deduce that if so then
such a phrase is identical with such another phrase
of course the case is different with natural philo
sophy as astronomy optics chemistry c
these deal with real truths but truths which no
one has any right to call eternal since things exist
as they do exist only by the will of the deity
geometry forms a separate case and it is a cu
rious enquiry whether its propositions are identical
against this opinion it may be urged first that it
has to do not with mere words but with something
that seems undeniably to have an existence separately
from our minds viz space a word which can no
more be defined than can the sun or the moon
secondly it does not appear as yet that geometers
even pretend to prove all their propositions from their
definitions inasmuch as the theory of parallels re
quires some unproved assumptionÃ¢€”yet to both of
these arguments a specious reply may be made to
the former it may be answered that though we cannot
speak of space as a creation of the mind like num
bers yet neither can we speak of it as a creation of
the deity like the sun and moon for that we are
unable to conceive of space as ever having been non
existent to the latter it may be answered that
though no geometer has settled the question of
parallels to the satisfaction of the rest yet none
regard it as a matter to be proved by experiment 
as in fact no experiments could prove it since magni
tudes soon become too small to be valued by sense
in this difficulty i am disposed to agree that the

syllogisms



want of received proof concerning parallels is no
objection against admitting geometry among the
pure sciences yet as space and its properties
appear undeniably to be learned by sense the argu
ment seems to me to preponderate for naming it a
mixed science and believing that its propositions
are real and not verbal truths
on syllogisms
what is a syllogism i have already explained
its validity depends entirely on the two verbal
truths that what is true of the universal is true
of the partial and what is false of the partial
is false of the general thus the syllogism
laws made in barbarous times are likely to be barbarous
all old laws were made in barbarous times 
therefore all old laws are likely to be barbarous 
stands on the same principle of evidence as
all men are mortal 
a
therefore some men are mortal i
the only difference is that the very word all so
manifestly includes some that even a logician would
not think it needful to state it whereas although
we may familiarly reason thus
laws made in barbarous times are likely to be barbarous 
therefore f old laws are likely to be barbarous 
Ã¢€¢ it is more familiar to use the inverted order thus old
laws are likely to be barbarous for they are always made in
barbarous times

Ã¢£

syllogisms

it is yet conceivable that some might doubt and
question whether old laws were necessarily in
cluded under the description of laws made in
barbarous times sometimes therefore it is ex
pedient to state both premisses
there seems however no ground for imagining a
new faculty of the mind discursus or ratiocinatio
to take cognizance of syllogism different from the
faculty required to deduce i from a nor does the
operation seem different nor in ordinary cases do
we feel it requisite to state both premisses of the
syllogism as the conclusion itself tells us what
premiss is meant to be supplied
thus if any one argue
wisdom is not to be expected from extreme youth 
therefore the faults of young monarchs are to be pardoned 
we see at a glance that he means to allege
faults springing from folly are pardonable at an age from
which wisdom is not to be expected 
and although it is not yet in aristotelic form no
person would either mistake or object to the form 
but if any rejected the conclusion it would be in
consequence of doubting or denying the truth of the
premisses
we generally omit that premiss which is the more
obvious and state that which is more questionable
or least known in order that thus the attention may
be fixed on the weakest parts of an argument if
there be a weakness but on what would be called
its turning point if all be sound thus perhaps one
might say

syllogisms



sto slaughter thousands is murder by wholesale 
therefore napoleon was a wholesale murderer 
because we all know that he slaughtered thousands
but it would be less natural to say
to light a duel is as bad as murder
therefore richard coeur de lion was as bad as a murderer 
because no duel of his is notorious though perhaps
historians may know of some if so one ought to
state it
 richard coeur de lion fought a duel 
t therefore he was as bad as a murderer 
and thus the implied principle is left to be gathered
to say the truth in cases so simple each way is
too intelligible to be found fault with and these are
merely illustrations it is however a common fallacy
to throw into the background and assume as if in
disputable some proposition that will not bear ex
amination meanwhile perhaps parading in full
syllogistic form other parts of the argument to draw
off attention from the weak point this constantly
throws as it were dust into mens eyes the confusion
produced by reciting syllogisms at full if there be
several is so great that no one would use two or
three full syllogisms close together in a common dis
cussion who was not a pedant or a sophist since
therefore both the omission of premisses and their
frequent insertion may be used as instruments of
deceit it must be left to the judgment and good
sense of individuals when to insert both or which to
insert as a general rule we can only say insert
d

syllogisms



that premiss which the hearers will be less likely to
insert of themselves and if the hearers be ignorant
of both or need to be reminded of both then insert
both in the latter case it is better to dwell sepa
rately on each and expand the thought by illustration
that they may have time to take it in and digest it
before drawing the conclusion
the aristotelic syllogism is put into such a form
that the three propositions composing it contain but
three distinct terms each term being taken twice
over so that one term called the middle term is
common to the two premisses in this way there
arise three figures as they are called depending on
the position of the middle term in the first
figure is proved any sort of conclusion in the second
figure only negatives in the third only partial con
clusions thus
fig 

fig 

fig 

all yisz

all x is y
therefore
all x is z

no z is y
j
all x is y
therefore
no x is z

all yisz

some y is x
therefoie
some x is z

that premiss which contains the term z the
predicate of the conclusion is called the major pre
miss for a very insufficient reason and is generally
placed first by the aristotelians the other follows it
and is called the minor in the first figure the line
connecting the middle term y slopes from left to
right in the second figure it occupies the right

syllogisms



hand side of the syllogism in the third the left hand
the schoolmen add a fourth figure not recognized
by aristotle in which the line slopes from right to
left but they allow that it is unnatural nor does it
appear ever to be used
technicals methods have been devised of detecting
false syllogisms but they appear wholly useless in
practice because a mere child can generally without
rule detect false syllogisms when they are put into
form the real difficulty is to put an argument into
syllogistic form when men are wanting in clearness
of head and one defends another attacks an argu
ment their quarrel generally is about its true form
and meaning as an argument while they are per
fectly agreed as to the laws of syllogisms in fact
the vast majority of disputes arise either out of
ambiguous words or premisses not admitted to be
true in neither of which cases can the laws of
syllogism bring any help
if in any case there be doubt whether a syllogism
s the school system is certainly a curiosity in its way to
exhaust the subject as aristotle loved all the possible com
binations of four propositions aeio taken and are sup
posed which gives x x or then it is shown that all
but of these are inadmissible the taken in figures are
 but again half of these are proved inadmissible and to
be a needless narrowing of some of the rest there remain 
that are regarded as sound and then pains are taken to reduce
the to and to show that the are at bottom the same
viz the assertion that what is true of the universal is true of
the partial c so that after all this trouble we fall back
on that which would have saved our work if we had begun
with it

syllogisms



is valid it may instantly be obviated by help of a
small diagram in which the propositions shall be as
it were depicted thus if we are discussing the
syllogism

all z is y
all x is y
therefore
all x is z

draw a circle to represent y and put both z and x
within this circle as the premisses direct and it
immediately appears that x and z may be entirely
exterior to each other or no x be z although
either may be in whole or part within the other
but if so it does not follow from the premisses
the same method is not only universally applicable
but is in principle philosophical as we may suppose
individuals dispersed over a plane and grouped toge
ther in circles as above
a few however of the aristotelic rules are interest
ing as the following a syllogism cannot have two
negative premisses nor two partial ones also if one
premiss be negative or partial so is the conclusion
it must now be clear that the validity of a syllo
gism the premisses being granted depends entirely
on the form not on the matter as it is equally valid
if symbols x y z be substituted for them never
theless objections may be of two kinds viz either
by calling in question the truth of a premiss or by

syllogisms



denying that the conclusion follows logically from
the premisses an objection of the former sort is
called extralogical because mere logic or rather
mere syllogistic rules cannot decide it
sometimes it appears as though the controversy
were logical when it is really extralogical persons
will say i admit your fact but i do not admit its
force as an argument when they really mean i
admit your expressed premiss but deny that which
is implied and suppressed the difficulty of re
ducing lengthy arguments into syllogistic form some
times leads even practised logicians into error with
deference to so high an authority i must say that i
think the archbishop of dublin has mistaken as to
the famous sophism of achilles and the tortoise
achilles runs a race and gives the tortoise the start
of a stadium and it is supposed that achilles runs
ten times as fast as the tortoise the sophist argues
thus when achilles has finished the stadium
the tortoise is rs in advance when achilles has run
through the tb the tortoise is rhs in advance when
achilles has run the ihs the tortoise is ttut in ad
vance and so on for ever therefore achilles will
never catch him dr whately considers it a suffi
cient refutation of this to say that no one is able
to reduce it to syllogistic form but surely his
business was to reduce it to such form and to show
us that when reduced it offended some of the aristotelic rules he mistakes it for a logical fallacy
whereas it is extralogical depending on a false pre
miss suppressed which it is the business of the
logician to bring to light and of the mathematician



syllogisms

to confute the false premiss is this that the sum
of the series rs tto tbot c ad infinitum which
the tortoise runs before he is caught is infinite
whereas it is just i so entirely is the fallacy
extralogical that if the velocities of achilles and
the tortoise were so adjusted that the series should
be i c whose sum is infinite the
conclusion would be most true yet the difficulty
which dr whately sees in reducing the argument to
syllogistic form would not be lessened
refutation is carried on in two ways by
objections against the argument of which i have
spoken as of two kinds by antisyllogism 
which is to prove by an independent chain of reason
ing the contradictory of the conclusion that is to be
refuted a common case of this is when it is said
that an argument proves too much i e from the
conclusion can be deduced something notoriously
false so that we oppose a direct disproof of it to
the direct proof of it that has been offered us this
is like opposing one mans oath to anothers and the
question might recur which is to be believed but
if the proof is long tangled and difficult while the
antisyllogism is short and plain the latter easily
wins the day thus no child is ever deceived by
 achilles and the tortoise because it is so easy
to antisyllogize by saying that when achilles has
run two stadia he has far outstripped his competitor
so in numerous difficult moral and metaphysical
arguments where men of common but sound intellect
cannot point out fallacies they yet manage to anti
syllogize so concisely and satisfactorily to themselves

syllogisms



as to despise the sophisms for flimsy trash yet
refutation is more complete jf both methods are
combined in fact if it has been found difficult
to point out fallacy yet easy to antisyllogize he
who ably exposes the source of the error is gene
rally instructive because the difficulty is almost
certain to have arisen from some weak concession
which we have made or some inconsistency in our
own scheme so that it has really been an argumentum ad hominem founded upon some error which
we are holding unawares
in the practice of reasoning we use far greater
condensation with much advantage than any thing
which the syllogistic form would suggest thus we
often descend at a single step from two or more
universals to their partials example 
r it is fit that youth should be guided by age 
j therefore young kings should not trample under foot the

counsel of aged ministers
here we descend from the general term youth to
a part of it viz young kings and from the general
term age to a part of it aged ministers but
farther there is an a fortiori argument that if they
ought to be guided much more ought they to show
respect which is less and in a certain sense a part
of the other and be very far from treating their
counsels with contumely doubtless all this might
be brought into syllogistic form but it would lose
in energy perhaps in clearness while in such re
ductions liberties with the words will generally be
taken quite as large and not more warrantable



hyrotheticals

than are requisite for drawing the conclusion out
right
mr locke has attacked syllogism as nugatory 
on the ground that as the conclusion is implied in
the premisses and adds nothing to them it is wholly
needless this is true so far that to state the pre
misses and omit the conclusion would be generally
found to be an intelligible mode of reasoning thus
 the barrister argued that his client was a peer
and that peers had a special exemption we supply
his conclusion therefore his client should have
the exemption but the merit of reasoning in syl
logistic form or not consists in finding and combining
the premisses in a particular way for the same
truths are often known to hundreds while but one
thinks of so grouping them as that certain conclu
sions result were it otherwise he who knows the
definitions of geometry would straightway be master
of the whole science
hypotheticals
in conducting a lengthened argument as in geo
metry it is useful to fix on intermediate propo
sitions which we may make stages or restingplaces
in proceeding towards the last result even if they
have no intrinsic value this is the method uni
formly employed in science and is properly didactic
but when persons have no leisure nor disposition
for a systematic lecture and when they have some
knowledge of the subject at least of many of its
elements and we cannot quite tell how much it is

hypthetcals
necessary often to pursue a reverse order to illus
trate this suppose an intelligent person unversed in
geometry were to ask some proof that a cone is
i of the cylinder of the same base and height it
would be requisite to feel our way backward with
him thus will you admit that a triangular pyra
mid is i of the parallelepiped of the same base
and height because if you will i can prove the
other ferhaps he will reply no i do not see it
but however i will concede it for the present and
do you show me how the other follows from it
when this has been done he will return and de
mand a proof of what he conceded and again we
have to sound him whether he allows that parallele
pipeds of equal base and height are equal and if he
concedes it for the moment we get another step
backward and so on until we reach something the
truth of which is manifest to him
in the language of symbols we show that m is
true if n is true that n is true if p is true and
p is true if q is true and so on until we come to
one as q of which we can say but q is allowed
to be true therefore p therefore n therefore m 
which last was to be proved this is named by
aristotelians the constructive hypothetical
if on the contrary we brought in some proof that
m is false we should infer that neither can q be
true this they call destructive hypothetical it
is to refute a hypothesis by showing that false
conclusions may be deduced
the term hypothesis has however a peculiar and
restricted sense in modern philosophy and what the



hypotheticals

schoolmen call hypotheses we rather name assump
tions or postulates when engaged with a construc
tive argument
other forms of hypothetical are also laid down by
aristotelians of which none is popular except the
dilemma which is when one of two or more
assumptions is undeniably true and the same con
clusion follows from each or every one

since all reasoning of an affirmative nature pro
ceeds from what is more to what is less general the
question will naturally arise how can the mind ever
arrive at a knowledge of general propositions for
except authoritative teaching all specific informa
tion gives us acquaintance only with particulars
while unless the case is such as to implicate divine
revelation authoritative teaching is unavailable for
how does the teacher get his knowledge 
the question might be divided into two parts viz
how are we guided to construct general propositions
and how do we verify them when constructed Ã¢€”
though these are different questions they are per
petually interfering with each otherÃ¢€”it is possible
that a proposition might never be absolutely verified
yet it is not therefore wholly useless it might
through want of some qualification be in strictness
false yet the occasions in which the omissions were
of importance might be so rare that in the great
majority of cases it should be true such proposi
tions may indeed be of immense practical value even
while we do not imagine that they are always true
another cause which prevents some propositions



induction

from being ever regarded as absolute truths lies in
the laxity of words found in them many words
have reference to degree of number or quantity so as
to vary in sense according to laws that cannot be
defined old and young great and small many and
few heavy and light and a thousand others enter
into propositions that are too valuable to discard 
while perhaps no mere verbal alteration will give
great precision thus we are led to admit a dis
tinction of truths into probable and absolutely
true by which is understood that the former are
oftener true than false perhaps so much oftener as
to make us willing to stake much upon their truth
but meanwhile we also inquire what modification
will make them yet more strictly true
the method of verification proceeds upon the
doctrine of chances as exemplified in numerous
common actions of life a farmer about to buy
wheat takes samples of corn at random from dif
ferent parts of several bags goldsmiths examining
coin from the mint similarly select their samples
if all those examined prove unimpeachable it is
inferred that the unexamined are equally sound
a spartan captive when asked whether his com
panions who fell in the battle were braver than he
replied that it must be a clever arrow that picked
out the brave menÃ¢€”just so if we wish to try the
truth of any general proposition we employ our
selves in deducing particular cases and bringing
them to some practical test a single instance of
falsity suffices to disprove the alleged truth at
least in its universality if then the proposition

induction



be not too far removed from the sphere of specific
information confutation of a false generality is
seldom very difficult when the mind is definitely
set to the task wherefore conversely if after many
attempts to convict a proposition of falsehood we
fail the probabilities are greatly in favor of its
being absolutely true
it is possible indeed that propositions may be
so untangible to us as that we cannot bring them
to any real trial at all as the reed to the wind
they bend before the assailant and thus avoid being
rooted up in such the mystical and transcendental
mind delights as an element in which it may ex
patiate and indulge itself without fear of refutation
but the very circumstance disables us also from
gaining any assurance that the vision is true as
virtue is known to be such by withstanding tempt
ation and undergoing ill usage so truth is known
by keeping its ground unflinchingly in spite of
objections and arguments obviously formidable per
haps apparently likely to overwhelm it and when
its candor shuns no attack its triumph under dis
advantage ascertains its own character but a man
may safely and lazily dogmatize about the seven
heavens the natures of the angels and other super
human matters where no one can confute himÃ¢€”
a most essential quality then in a theory as we
may call our proposition while but partially verified
is that it should admit of numerous deductions of a
practical kind such as if false we should be likely
to detect and if it be in a matter where mathema
tical calculations are of avail a theory which will



induction

stand such a test as that of number and measure
is very soon accepted as incontrovertibly verified
we must in all cases beware lest our samples be
unfairly taken if they are limited in their nature
this ought generally to suggest a limitation in the
proposition itself thus if we have been engaged in
verifying the assertion that extended countries that
are under one government necessarily fall under
despotism should a review of our examples show
that they are confined in any way as to nations
practising polygamy to those under debasing super
stition to countries of uniform surface or to those
corrupted by luxury and vice it may then be in
quired whether these particulars are already implied
in the proposition or need to be introduced a man
engaged in determining the quantity of salt in sea
water is examining specimens from various seas in
different parts but on finding that all the specimens
were taken from the surface he modifies his state
ment by saying water taken from the surface of
the sea instead of saying sea waterÃ¢€”contains
such or such a weight of salt
as a general rule concerning samples is to take
them as unlike as possible the same here applies a
man who wishes to test the statement that all
bodies expand with heat will do well to take bodies
as unlike as possible to each other solids liquids
and airs hard and soft crystallized and uncrystallized and expose some to considerable heat others
to much cold a few wellchosen samples will thus
convey vastly more valuable instruction than shoals of
instances ill digested

induction



without these precautions no amount of experience
is of any avail with them a younger man who has
seen life in various contrast may often have more
real experience than an octogenarian from that
false verification which is got up by illchosen samples
proceeds most of the dogmatism and other faults attri
buted to practical men it is indeed the strong
hold of all quackery to doctor and patient farmer
and merchant historian and statesman an old
woman cures fever by a charm a merchant rejoices
if gold is flowing into the country a legislator
maintains the game laws under which england has
flourished all of these wise persons have some
thing to plead on the score of experience and
against experience what can be said 
but it must be remembered that there is no end
to the successive modifications which our general
truths may possibly need for they are never by this
process proved absolutely true at best it is shown
that they are almost always trustworthy but it may
happen that after a thousand successive instances of
truth the next instance turns out false nor is there
any absolute security against this had not water
been the liquid on which thermometrical experiments
were naturally first made a thousand instances
might have been found of liquids expanding with
heat before a case was found of a liquid below a
certain temperature contracting with heat yet
when this case arises it does not make vain all the
former experience nor entirely set aside the general
proposition but is added to it as an exception
the progress of modern astronomy may be a type



induction

of the progress of all general propositions that the
heavenly bodies moved in perfect circles was the
dogma of the aristotelian school a dogma that
reigned for years because men lazily dispensed
with verifying their propositions when disproved
it was modified into the statement that the orbits are
ellipses a sort of less perfect circle and again
perturbations were recognized in the elliptical orbit
nay the very newtonian law of gravity is not exempt
from possible farther modification but as has been
suggested it may ultimately be found to need some
change that shall make it embrace the phenomena of
molecular attraction and repulsion
such is generally the order of discovery it begins
perhaps with a guess a rough statement at least
that will often be very wide of the truth afterwards
comes an approximation which may still be very
inaccurate yet which has been corrected with some
regard to the facts next we have a more sifting
examination of wellchosen facts now that we begin
to see what will prove the cases most likely to fail
and therefore the severest test and by help of such
examination a valuable and trustworthy truth is at
length attained yet after all room is left for fresh
correction especially when new fields of nature new
worlds of action or thought open upon us this
may make former experience in comparison appear
narrow and show that many things ought to have
Ã¢– been accompanied with limitations that were not
thought of perhaps that has been said of light
which ought to have been said of sunlight that
has been said of vegetation which is true only of

induction



european vegetation what has been said concern
ing mankind proves to be true only of heathens
the method of verifying general propositions
which has been explained is generally called the
method of induction the word is perhaps unhappy
as indeed it is taken in several vague senses but to
abolish it is impossible it is the latin translation
of htywyr which word is used by aristotle as a coun
terpart to auwoyurpos he seems to consider it in a
perfect or dialectic and in an imperfect or rheto
rical sense thus if a genus g contained four
species a b c d syllogism would argue that
what is true of g is true of any one of the four but
perfect induction would reason that what we can
prove true of a b c d separately we may
properly state as true of g the whole genus this
is evidently a formal argument as demonstrative as
syllogism but the imperfect or rhetorical induction
will perhaps enumerate three only of the species
and then draw the conclusion concerning g which
virtually includes the fourth or what is the same
thing will argue that what is true of the three is to
be believed true likewise of the fourth
looking to the derivations of enaytoytj and inductio they seem to agree better with the imperfect
than with the perfect acceptation as meaning to
draw upon or overdraw when we know a b
and c we draw liri in addition the d as belonging
to the same class if this be not the derivation i do
not know how to account for the word
yet assuredly great injustice is done to the argu
mentative force of the baconic induction when it is
e



induction

represented barely to be an imperfect enumeration 
as though we asserted something to be true of all of
a class because it is true of some or of many for it
is not the number of the samples but the mode of
taking them that is chiefly of importance on this
it is that the argument from the chances depends 
an argument based not on our knowledge but on our
ignorance and therefore always fallible yet to practi
cal purposes true if we have no reason to suppose
the samples unfair we presume that they are fair 
but if any uniformity be detected in the principle on
which they are chosen suspicion of their unfairness
enters as far however as i am acquainted with the
works of aristotle i am led to believe that he did
not see this and thought rhetorical induction to be
merely an imperfect enumeration
what then is the doctrine of chances on which all
our verifications depend it amounts to little more
than alleging that it is hard to pick out blindfold
black balls from the midst of equally numerous white
ones and equally hard out of a multitude of true
and false propositions blindfold to pick out the true
we conclude that if in numerous trials all which we
pick prove true the proportion of the false to the
true must be very small there is no end to the
useful applications of the doctrine of chance by it
the errors of observation are corrected there being
no reason to believe that an observer will always err
in one way the mean of half a dozen observations is
probably correct even the errors of instruments
are thus also checked a beautiful example is in
reference to the errors of graduation thus on the

induction



great circle at greenwich the degrees are read off
simultaneously at six different parts of the circle 
and the errors of graduation neutralize each other in
taking the mean
we may now contrast this method of verification
with the syllogistic process it involves the syllogism
no doubt and by help of the last proposition con
cerning the chances all might be thrown into a
syllogistic form but there is an enormous practical
difference in this that the one sets the mind more at
work upon words and the other upon things the
aristotelian is acting the lawyer who tells what the
law is the baconian is as the historian or legislator
who considers what it ought to be the former
looks on his general propositions as immoveable and
eternal the latter is always ready to modify them
and if he draws syllogisms from them it is as often
to test the general principles by the conclusion as to
learn the particular from the general history shows
that the tendency of the aristotelic philosophy was
to produce a speculating unpractical lazy mind that
fancies generals to be more easily known than par
ticulars and is averse to inquire into matter of fact 
lazy as unwilling to be subjected to the labour of
pulling down and remodelling what was imperfect
but in induction we simultaneously consider whether
the proposition in question is true and if not whether
by any modification it may approximate to truth
as regards the facility of avoiding error in the two
cases in verifying general propositions we are
seldom in danger of syllogistic error because the
syllogisms are short and simple but the great
b



experiment and observation

difficulty is to avoid unfair samples of the case in
syllogizing when the reasoning is complicated a
chief danger is from ambiguous words against which
the aristotelic rules most imperfectly secure us

experiment and observationto get fair samples is comparatively easy where
experiment as well as observation is open to us of
the important difference between these two the
ancients were most inadequately aware aristotle
was a great observer but he was not an experiment
alist even archimedes the greatest proficient in
the exact sciences of early times would seem to have
been equally unapt at experiment he never reached
a step in mechanics beyond the doctrine of the
lever which admits of being thought out without
any help but such observation as nature forces upon
all nor was it until the days of galileo that the
value of experiment was exemplified newton it is 
observed by sir john herschel turned astronomy
into a science of experiment by connecting celestial
and terrestrial mechanics and this accordingly be
came the grand sera of its advance this also is the
great point which bacon has added to aristotle
the latter assuredly knew induction to be of essential
importance though i doubt whether even in theory
he knew how by a discriminating selection of in
stances the apparent fallacy of the rhetorical in
duction is obviated but he could not clear his way
through numerous received dogmas the falsehood of
which he did not suspect and he was led to corrupt

experiment and observation



physics by a sort of mystical jargon bacon is dis
tinguished chiefly for his emphatic sense of the
neglect of experiment and its various applicability
 his philosophy says sir j herschel was
characterized by his keen perception and his broad
and spiritstirring almost enthusiastic announcement
of its paramount importance viz of the inductive
method as the alpha and omega of science as the
grand and only chain for the linking together of
physical truths and the eventual key to every dis
covery and every application wellchosen and
varied experiments enable us to detect what is acci
dental and sort out properties and characteristics
the experimentalist generally endeavours to form a
probable opinion as to what circumstances of the
experiment act independentlythough in combination
to influence the result and then repeats it with a
change if possible in one only of these circumstances
in the celebrated experiments of dr wells on dew
we learn that he exposed various substances in suc
cession to catch the dew substances differing in
nature as glass metals paper c in shape in
polish in texture again under cover under a cloudy
sky and under a clear sky according as he guessed
that these things might affect the result it is hence
manifest that experiments are far more valuable
when the first steps of natural science have been
taken than before as it rarely happens that the
rude and wholly unpractised judgment can devise
them suitably yet viewed as an argument they
h study of nat phil p 



experiment and observation

need not rest on a previous basis but may be ap
pealed to as the very first steps of the science
in many cases it is not possible entirely to remove
some of the causes influencing the result so as to see
how the others act alone but we can yet diminish
them greatly by diminishing one of them gradually
we obtain results which constitute a scale of intensity
usefully illustrating the disturbing force of that one
circumstance upon all the rest thus a complicated
problem is taken as it were to pieces and we learn
how each part of the result is due wholly or chiefly
to some part of the circumstances
that which dr whately has named the argu
ment from approximation is of this kind his
example will best explain the phrase in mechanics
we examine the case of a body moving by impulse
and find that it stops sooner or later and generally
very soon the ancients as the vulgar supposed
the impulse to be simply expended and that the
nature of impulsive force was such as necessarily to
decay with time the modern experimentalist ob
serves that collision and friction rapidly lessen the
motion and by a graduated series of trials finds
that the diminution of motion so corresponds with a
diminution of these disturbing causes as to lead to
the probable conjecture that if we could entirely
remove these the motion would be uniform recti
linear and eternal it is by a sort of approximation
that we are guided to this result which yet stands
urgently in need of afterverification because our
senses are not keen enough to deal thoroughly with
the subject by direct experiment such verification

experiment and observation



is fortunately practicable and most satisfactory be
cause the law to which we have been guided is so
readily applied to the most accurate mathematical
computations
in departments of knowledge where we cannot
experiment two methods may be employed to guard
against deception to make the most of observ
ation by extending its sphere as much as the case
will admit thus does the natural or moral and
political historian extend his research to the most
remote tribes of the globe in search of examples
suited to test the propositions he is examining
 to investigate d priori what cases will be severe
tests and then watch for their arrival the latter
method generally implies some previous science and
this it is which makes the observations of the man of
science so valuable because besides greater accuracy
they are better chosen in moral reasonings these
last sometimes form what are called d fortiori argu
ments as though one were to say nothing will
make the degenerate romans fight at least they
have borne to be massacred by thousands in prefer
ence such also have been called crucial instances 
a name borrowed from the schools and fixed upon
us by the authority of bacon



presumptions

presumptions
i have endeavoured to explain the systematic
method by which the educated and the cautious
intellect endeavors to verify or modify propositions
but prior generally to this there is a ruder sort
of work more or less common to all men which
must be noticed for a more complete view of the
subject
we have even in common with brute
animals a certain instinctive principle which we call
association without which perhaps reasoning would
never exist or rather human life could certainly
never subsist a child which has burned its fingev
in the candle associates the light and flame with the
pain that it feels and learns another time to avoid
the danger a dog that has been shot runs away
from a gun there must manifestly be in the mind
something equivalent to the assertion that what has
happened once may happen or fear says will
happen again and such instinctive fears are ob
viously necessary to guard us in the dangers that
beset life
such also is the nature of what is called a pre
sumption we may indeed say it is a presumption
that the second candle will burn as painfully as the
first more widely where we see external simi
larity there is a presumption in favor of internal and
entire similarity a child that has never before seen
a rocking horse mistakes it at first for a real horse
again where there is a similarity in that which

lhfsumitions



most strikes the mind we have a presumption that
there is a general similarityÃ¢€”but in all these cases
we only mean that we are predisposed thus to believe
until farther evidence be offered
these are not properly reasonings or at best are
most immature reasonings but there is a difference
between presumption and mere association in the
latter being instinctive and involuntary not the fruit
of deliberate thought yet neither is so bound on
us that we cannot shake them off they are sus
ceptible of correction of confirmation or of actual
obliteration by a farther experience and as the
judgment is more cultivated association becomes
more subjected to its dictates but the principle
of association undisciplined is the fruitful parent
of every superstition from vulgar fears of unlucky
days and colors spilling salt and screech owls to the
mysticism which found religious properties in num
bers and to the monstrosities of heathen polytheism
presumptions are unverified propositions which
are nevertheless valuable we know that they are
not proved yet in human life we are often satisfied
to be on the safe side of error and the presumption
gives us a reason for judging which is this to
verify it by trial may involve too great a cost of
suffering expense or inconvenience armed strang
ers appear on the coasts the presumption is that
they are pirates it is not expedient to try it by the
shortest method but if they will remove we are
pleased even to be left in ignorance but on such
a presumption we should act as though it were
certainly trueÃ¢€”in short the universal effect of a
e



presumptions

presumption is to throw the burden of proof on
the one side instead of the other the importance of
which is often very great in english law we regard
it as a valuable principle that a man is counted
innocent till he is proved guilty how could any
one long escape condemnation whose previous cha
racter was so bad as to allow our setting up the
presumption that he was guilty of every thing
except where he proved his innocence 
we must here bring forward an important rule
concerning presumptions identical with what was
above said on theories for a theory is little else
than a halfverified presumption it is that when we
must needs choose one of several presumptions we
should choose that which will be easiest of confutation
iffalse if none such can be found that is if they are
all transcendental reasoning is useless and knowledge
impossible for example if we are inquiring which
of the following presumptions we will follow Ã¢€”that
mechanical forces and masses of matter retain the
same nature as far as the moon and no farther as
the greek philosophy held or else throughout
boundless spaceÃ¢€”we find that if we take the former
we can never know any thing of astronomy not even
that the sun is where it seems to be or near but if
we take the latter it will probably be detected if
false thus we can but have to abandon it when
disproved while if in spite of much exposure to
trial it stands then we shall have learned a truth
precisely the same reasoning has been applied in
a most interesting field by mr lyell in his elements
of geology the question is are we to presume

pitejudick and presumption



that the geological monuments before our eyes were
effected by causes the same or nearly the same as
those which now act or else by causes quite different
in nature or intensity in past ages the prevailing
school of geologists as once astronomers decided
on that alternative which could neither be proved
nor disproved by any practical test which is equi
valent to disclaiming all knowledge and giving
boundless licence to speculation mr lyell is the
uncompromising advocate of the principle that we
must use our utmost endeavors to reconcile the
opposite presumption with existing monuments for
thus it will be at length either disproved or else
received as true because it cannot be disproved
at any rate we shall learn up to what point it holds
true and where it begins to fail that is how far
knowledge may go and where utter ignorance must
begin
prejudices and presumptions
a large proportion of what we call our know
ledge really consists of presumptions so does a
large proportion of our principlesÃ¢€”religious na
tional or sectarian nothing so gives a turn to the
whole character and mind as to have these right or
wrong their influence is often unsuspected in
philosophy and in religionÃ¢€”the presumption with
a mohammedan may be that every christian is a
cheat and so indeed do opposite factions of all sorts
conceive unworthy prepossessions of each other but
again with us it is through the happy influence of
jewish history always a presumption that other



prejudice and presumption

men are of one blood and one nature with ourselves
held even by those who care little for religion the
greeks and romans would have considered the pre
sumption quite the other way insomuch that they
were indisposed to make full enquiry whether slaves
have all the passions feelings and powers of menÃ¢€”
in science also we now are habituated to assume the
stability of nature not only so far as we have veri
fied it for we are ready to carry it far beyond actual
observation if telescopes were invented to enlarge
the sphere of vision times an astronomer
would have the entire burden of proof laid most
heavily on him who should assert that the mecha
nical laws of nature which here obtain fail in the
remotest regions of space but the greeks as i
observed were so prepossessed with the belief that
the laws of nature as here acting did not reach
beyond the moon that the whole burden of proof
at first rested on the modern philosophers who said
that they did nay the ancients clearly had their
doubts whether the laws of nature even in this world
did not change with time which change they called
corruption of all things
to such mistaken presumptions the term prejudice
is generally appliedÃ¢€”but the question will arise why
we do not call all presumptions prejudices seeing
that all are alike unverified for it would seem that
till it be known which are true all ought to stand on
the same footing but the difference is this so soon
as we mistake a presumption for a proved truth it is
to be called a prejudice because we have forgotten
its true nature every man must needs have count

prejudice and presumption



less unverified propositions in his mind which yet
have a presumption of truth but the candid cau
tious and enlarged mind is open to have them proved
or disproved when opportunity offers the rash
lazy and dogmatic forgets that they are unproved
and neglects opportunities of bringing them to the
test this is the prejudiced man the evil habit
of mind mounts into bigotry when he is so enamored
of his thoughts as actually to avoid with detestation
whatever he suspects might tend to undermine them
the contrary habit is of all the most difficult and
important to the attainment of truth viz duly to
discriminate the measure of proof by which each
presumption is supported some being bare pre
sumptions others much stronger others nearly veri
fied this seems to be what mr locke meant by
saying that the love of truth consists in holding no
proposition more strongly than the evidence warrants
there is here it must be allowed a difficulty per
haps in strictness there is no temper of mind inter
mediate to latitudinarianism and bigotry to those
who do not narrowly search into their own opinions
and their reasons for holding them nay it requires
much anxious thought to arrive at a decisive intel
lectual proof of various points of morality as that
truth ought not to be violated even for the best
ends or generally that ends will not sanction
 by this term i here mean the state of mind in which a man
has nothing but dry light knowing that propositions are
true and choosing truth with preference yet not loving any
truths even after they are ascertained to be such nor likely to
grieve if they were all ultimately disproved



prejudice and presumption

means yet are we to call a man bigoted who
when intellectually unable to refute a sophistical
argument urging him to lie turns against it in
disgust and banishes it from his mind indeed this
conduct seems often the only defence of weak or
unexercised intellects and in many temptations is
the safeguard and the criterion of virtue in all
hence it is in the weakminded or in the religious
and sensitively moral chiefly that bigotry prevails
and yet oftener seems to prevail when it does not
really it is one thing to be satisfied that we have
an antisyllogism stronger than the adversarys argu
ment or to see that there is somewhere a fallacy on
his part and quite another thing to be able to set it
out clearly nor is human life long enough to refute
all the finespun follies of others on this ground
conduct which at first sight may appear bigoted has
often a real justification but the truth is that few
trouble themselves at all with the analysis of their
opinions or care to know what is the strength of
evidence for and against them so that positive belief
and positive disbelief are the principal states of their
minds while they dread what is intermediate under
the name of a sceptical turn
the error of scepticism is perpetually a result of
the very thing on which we have been remarking
if any one has habitually regarded various prejudices
as of equal certainty with the most important and
sacred truths any thing that accidentally undeceives
him as to some of the former may make him all at
once doubt every thing for the very reason that he
is not accustomed to discriminate degrees of evidence

prejudice and presumption



but besides this universal scepticism there is often
a partial scepticism the fruit of inexperience in
particular departments many a man of strong
sense as to the affairs of daily life thinks astronomers
fools and physicians quacks and many persons
accustomed to study the world of matter find so
much uncertainty concerning the world of mind
as to be in danger of scepticism concerning morals
and religion it is not right to turn these results
to the discredit of any special study or occupation
but rather to take them as marking the ill effect
of too exclusive a devotion of the mind to any separate
trains of thought



analogv
sect iv

it was above remarked that the modern scientific
world held with great strength the presumption of
the stability of the laws of nature the phrase is
one which deserves fuller analysis in one sense
it is in fact a mere truism for if nothing be
acknowledged as a law which proves to be mutable
the proposition verifies itself some have proposed
the following as a mysterious truth which we know
by intuition that like causes produce like effects
but the same remark holds here also this may be
so explained as to make it a truism viz if we
measure the causes by the effects as is generally
done by the advocates of philosophical necessity
but if otherwise it is sometimes a truth learned by
experience in other cases as far as has been hitherto
shown not a truth all
the progress however of the sciences has led to a
most extensive verification of the permanence of the
mechanical laws of the universe and in the opinion
of perhaps the soundest physiologists the perma
nence of the distinctions which constitute species
add to this the permanence of the properties which
belong to definite combinations of matter or to sub
stances which we regard as simple but it is quite
fallacious to speak as though any assumption con
cerning the stability of nature were essential to our
reasonings and much less do we know of such
stability otherwise than by experience and so far as
experience testifies

analogy



but in all those subjects in which we have arrived
at a conviction of this stability and where we are
able to portion out the objects of contemplation into
natural classes an important result is produced upon
our reasonings it enables us to concentrate attention
and experiment on a few points and diminish the
number of our trials without proportionate risk of
error hence also arises a contrast between induc
tion and analogy which needs to be thoroughly ex
plained
again it must be lamented that we find ambi
guities of sense and discrepancies between old and
new philosophy in the use of terms but as the
distinction is one of realities and not very subtle
such ambiguities need not greatly embarras us
from the properties of one piece of iron to infer
the same properties in another piece of iron and
in every other piece is called induction but from
the properties of the iron to infer like properties
in copper is called analogy we take liberty to
call iron and iron the same substance while iron
and copper are only called like substances and
to reason from like to like is called analogy not
induction yet in strictness one piece of iron is not
the same as another it is only very like and in
scientific language homogeneous we speak also of
our induction as direct evidence yet in strictness it
is indirect though closer home than the analogical
so likewise he who argues from the effects of
medicines on several men to prove their effects on
other men or on mankind is said to reason by
induction but to argue from the case of men to



analogy

brutes or from one species of brute to another
species would be called analogy
in truth both arguments are based upon a con
cealed principle ou which their validity depends 
which principle itself needs verification from other
sources in the case of the induction it will be
that homogeneous substances have like properties
or animals of the same species have like physical
peculiarities
or some other such and the con
siderable cogency which such reasonings possess is
entirely due to the fact that these general principles
have been already verified as truths of science if
otherwise the reasoning is worthless
the former of these propositions needs more ex
amination it may be asked what do we mean by
homogeneous and how do we know that iron and
iron are homogeneous we call two bodies homo
geneous when we find that all their most obvious
properties are the same if the colour the weight
the hardness to the touch or other peculiarity the
character of the grain when broken the sound when
struck the smell the taste are all alike in the two
substances appeal having here been made to all the
five senses we pronounce the bodies homogeneous
then follows the presumption that those which
have all their most obvious properties in common
have also their more hidden properties in common Ã¢„¢
which is verified as a truth in so many cases as to
make it in all others also highly probable of course
it cannot be absolutely proved because the terms
 more obvious and more hidden are not precise
enough

analogy



but what is to be said if in one of the substances
a property is actually discovered which the other has
not for this will test the sense in which we use the
term homogeneous if the quality as suppose mag
netic power appears permanently to exist in the one
and never in the other or to be communicable by
known means to the one but incommunicable to the
other we should probably consider them heteroge
neous this appears to prove our acceptation of the
term homogeneous to be such as to make it a verbal
truth that things homogeneous have like properties
if so the presumption on which the inductive argu
ment rests must be stated thus where all the
most obvious properties are in common the sub
stances are homogeneous or have all the properties
in common
this presumption is so weighty because in so
many instances verified to the fullest extent of in
quiry that it is but little to say that the burden of
proof is by it thrown on him who denies it accord
ingly in physical reasonings it is taken for granted
that iron is iron and lead is lead until some
discrepancy suggests that the substances are not
pure or some other diversity and if the same
experiment under the very same circumstances is
repeated this is generally to guard against errors
of observation and other casual sources of mistake
and not as though it were doubted whether the
substances which we name homogeneous would al
ways give the same results
it is the possession of some general principle which
has at least a presumption of truth that adds plausi



analogy

bility to an argument every example gains tenfold
weight being looked on as aristotle observes as
a credible witness to matter of fact while a laborious
collection of details often seems and is a mere heap of
confusion
in the case of analogy the concealed principle
which connects like and like is seldom so cogent
that is so well grounded as that which connects
things believed to be homogeneous and chiefly for this
reason that the word like admits of so much vague
ness suppose that after discovering the magnetic
properties of iron any one had proceeded to infer
that the same must be possessed by copper the
form of the argument is the same as to infer that
iron will melt with great heat because we have
succeeded in melting the copper yet it is evident
that such analogical arguments standing alone will
seldom establish more than presumptions the gene
ral proposition here assumed is that like substances
enjoy the same properties which is full as often
false as true
there is at any rate one great point of value in
analogical arguments in the useful direction they
give to inquiry perhaps most of the great dis
coveries to which philosophers have been led may be
referred to the guidance of analogy and things
which we begin with considering as only alike we
k he divides speeches into two kinds those which abound
with examples which is the rhetoric of the old school and
those resting on arguments or topics if we can get a plausible
topic and back it up by even one good example this he seems
to think tells best

analogy



sometimes end in pronouncing the same or homo
geneous when newton first compared the fall of
an apple and the motion of the moon it was with
him an analogy that is he thought he saw a like
ness where we have since learned to see an identity
the satellites around jupiter were rightly regarded
as a solar system in miniature and the argument
from analogy hence drawn is said to have had great
weight in recommending the views of copernicus
but we now look on all the planets as being of one
species and family at least as regards all mechanical
forces actuating themÃ¢€”but analogy as was being
said suggests a thousand inquiries many of which
prove useful our earth has an atmosphere seas
mountains do the like things belong to the
moon and planets the ants live in communities 
have they separate houses private property soldiers
slaves cattleÃ¢€”there is so much interest in dis
covering analogies that they seem to repay the labor
of inquiry and prove a great stimulus to reflection
as well as help to the memory how uninviting do
many departments of science appear the philologist
surprises persons by the delight which he can find in
turning the pages of a dictionary in a language
unknown to him the analogies which he discovers
are his reward it is the part of the educated
man says aristotle to discern similarities such
being the propensity of the mind analogy is like a
hound always on the scent and on the alert for
every indication of game
it is frequently analogy which guides the expe
rienced to what are called good guesses when it



analogy

has been proved that light is reflected and refracted
according to certain laws we guess by analogy that
the same is true of heat nay that double refrac
tion and polarization may be found in heat what
they have in common is radiation from a centre
and this is supposed enough to constitute likeness
but although single analogies are not a cogent
argument the multiplication of them will merge in
a perfectly unexceptionable induction viz when we
can constitute a general proposition adequately sup
ported by fact to infer that iron may be melted
because brass may be melted is analogy or to infer
the same because lead or because tin or silver can
be melted is still analogy but to reason that iron
may be melted because brass and copper and lead
and tin and silver will all melt is no longer analogy
but induction
in the latter case the classification which prevails
in nature guides us to see that the real proposition
driven at is this that metals will melt with adequate
heat while iron is contemplated only as one out of
this class and brass copper tin lead silver are the
samples by which we verify the general proposition
both the analogy and the induction are liable to
 the moderns obstinately and most justly refuse to recognize
distinctions which depend on form and not on the spirit and
meaning of an argument but according to the aristotelians
it is still analogy so long as the conclusion stated is the single
case of iron but if the conclusion be metals then it it
induction but the difference is verbal for he who says metals
herein includes iron while he who says iron means to come at
his conclusion through the generic term metals

analogy



refutation by the same topic suppose it had been
found that gold would burn but would not melt
an objection would then be made that the analogy
or the induction proved too much for the argument
would equally apply to gold and yet in the case of
gold is false but if no such exception can be found 
if all metals but the hardest had been actually melted
and if the harder were found generally to take more
heat no man would hesitate to infer that only more
heat was wanting to melt the very hardest again 
from the peculiarities common to species as such in
numerous animals and vegetables open to our ex
amination to conclude like things of other species
which are not equally open to examination is also
called analogy but when the field of research is
widened to the full extent of our knowledge it
differs only in name from induction
an illustration of combined analogies is in the
argument for the undulatory theory of light and
heat in waves of water we can see undulations 
in the case of sound we can see the impulses it
causes in elastic substances and though we cannot
see we can both feel and weigh the air and fully
ascertain its existence waves and sound have the
same laws of reflection and interference as has light 
and the latter phenomenon interference is so pecu
liar as to impress the mind forcibly that two
lights should make darkness appears at first unin
telligible and almost incredible but when we see
two waves interfere so as to produce at intervals
waves of double highth and at intervals smooth



analogy

water and when we find the same phenomenon to
exist in sounds we are struck with the conviction
that light must also be an undulation like the waves
of water and like sound yet here it is not merely
the likeness of the two things compared that is
important but the peculiarity of the phenomena 
and the more difficult the lock to be opened the
more pleased are we with our key when we find it
hence this argument connects itself with what we
shall have to say concerning hypotheses
on the whole analogy is to be regarded as a step
towards satisfactory proof much in advance of first
presumptions if skilfully applied though if the
excessive vagueness of the word like be not checked
arguments from analogy may be of the wildest and
silliest kind but presumptions are strengthened by
apt analogies and the mind is so far predisposed by
them to believe that it seems equitable to exact a
less amount of direct verification where it is difficult
to be had yet the conviction which such arguments
command is generally that which has been called an
otiose assent or that of a man who finds his mouth
shut from objecting but will stake no practical loss
or harm upon the belief of its truth moreover the
last condition must be well attended to for no
reasoner is so vexatious as he who when direct
topics are at hand persecutes one with analogies
for just as it is to pay respect to them in defect of
other evidence they will not weigh a straw against
it and he who flourishes with analogy and metaphor
to the neglect of what is more obvious is like the

cause and effect



tailor at laputa who measured the stature of his
customer with a sextant and computed his waist by
the girth of his thumb
in conclusion it is well to remark that the strength
of certain analogical arguments does not rest on
analogy as such but they have more of cogency
than the name gives one to suppose the celebrated
analogy drawn by butler between natural and
revealed religion is if i mistake not of this nature
he points out similarities between the two that are
not on the surface nor found without close thought
and yet which bear a sifting enquiry the question
arises how to account for these similarities only
two hypotheses seem to the point either it is a
chance event if christianity be a chance system
struck out by ignorant fishermen on the basis begun
by an ancient jewish legislator else it arises from
the fact that both systems own the same author
thus the power of the argument is to be referred to
the head of selecting hypotheses on which we are
to speak below
cause and effect
it has been already observed that there is in us
an instinctive principle which we name association
which leads us to expect that an event which we
have once seen to follow another shall follow it a
second time if a sulphureous smell and darkening
of the atmosphere has once preceded an earthquake
the same smell and darkness cannot recur without
giving a painful presentiment that another earthquake
is coming
f



causb and effect

it is natural to the mind to draw this inference
though experience may again correct the inference
but when it is not thus corrected we become con
firmed in the belief we become convinced that the
connection of the two events is not accidental so as
sometimes to exist and sometimes not but is some
how in the nature of things nay we feel justified
in saying not only that b did follow a but that b
could not but follow a and looking to the future
we judge not only that b will follow a but that it
must follow when we have proceeded to this point
the mind has fully formed the notion of cause and
effect yet i believe that it is not by mere observ
ation without consciousness that we arrive at this
notion and i must endeavour to trace more accu
rately what i apprehend to be the process followed
by the mind in this matter
we are conscious of inward power by which we
can act on outward objects first conceiving a desire
next an intention until by an exertion of strength
we effect our purposes on this consciousness pri
marily depends our idea of causation we feel that
we are capable of acting so as to become causes and
to produce effects and we infer the same of other
men and other animals whence generalizing we may
state living force as the most obvious sort of cause
with which men gain acquaintance our apprehen
sion it will be seen of such causation depends on
our consciousness of will and of effort when a man
raises a weight he believes that the cause Ã¢®f the
weights rising is in himself and not in it for no
other reason but because he is conscious that the

cause and effect



beginning of motion is in himself for if he will to
raise it it rises and if he will it not it rises not
this argument applies directly only to ones self and
by transference to all who have in common with
ones self the power of willing to do or not to do and
of putting forth or not putting forth the effort on
which the result depends when we are contem
plating objects which we suppose not to possess will
of course these considerations are inapplicable
our voluntary actions are sometimes determined
by habit sometimes by a direct active exertion of
will just as we see numerous objects without look
ing at them while at others we direct the eye with
attention we are conscious that when we exert
will actively there is great variety and irregularity
in all that we do that which we do from habit has
a uniformity and sameness which is not found when
we act with deliberate purpose if we were therefore
to see a man do the same actions every day without
any deviation and utter the same words we should
doubt whether he possessed active powers of will at
all so when we look on the starry heavens and find
them night after night performing similar courses
or if they deviate from month to month yet at the
end of a year recurring to the same track perhaps
as we see no mark of will we may at first dispense
with discussion upon cause and effect for as there
must be some stop to defining the terms of our
definitions so must there be some stop to assigning
causes of causes a simple and uninformed mind
is satisfied to stop very soon an unsound speculative
mind is not satisfied to stop soon enough a savage
f



cause and effect

is most clearly m conscious that he is the cause of his
own deliberate actions but what is the cause of his
existence he possibly does not inquire he is as
sured that the sun is the cause of day probably
from observing that he can produce a sort of dark
ness by sheltering himself from the sun but what
is the cause of the suns motion he does not ask
that which is is it is its nature to move as the
nature of the earth to be still it seems as needless
to ask the cause of the one as of the other and if
a cause could be assigned as that a vortex of ether
carried the sun round the new question rises what
makes the vortex move round and thus nothing is
gained in short it is only where such irregularity
of motion and rest and other changing phenomena
are observed as to produce appearances of will and
of life that the idea of causation obtrudes itself
forcibly on the untutored mind
it is interesting to observe how all the phenomena
of the world were regarded by the lively energetic
ra it may be replied that men are conscious or fancy they are
conscious of many things that do not exist a man who has
lost his leg is conscious of a pain in his toe a lunatic is con
scious of imaginary crimes even without morbid feelings
want of close introspection may make a man attribute to the
acting of his will that which is really produced by habit or by
physical causes j and he may think that he is conscious of this
i am not now assuming that the judgment of the untutored
mind is right but i am tracing the course which it actually
follows at the same time when any one disputes the truth of
that of which the mass of mankind believe themselves conscious
the burden of disproof lies on him universal consciousness
must be presumed true except where it can be proved mistaken

cause and effect



minds of the ancient greeks rude and uninformed
but quick of perception full of inquisitiveness and
ready of imagination
the flowing of tides and currents the blast of the
wind the shock of the earthquake the fall of the
thunderbolt were of course imputed to the immediate
effort of muscular power in some great being the
motion of the sun and moon were not too regular to
be imputed to the same cause though we should
perhaps be attributing too much to their philoso
phizing and too little to their poetry if we here laid
stress on the fact that they supposed the chariot of
the sun to be drawn by four horses every day it is
however clear that for every natural phenomenon
which seemed to need to be accounted for their
universal practice was to suppose some living being
whose efforts produced it hence they invented a
deity to cut out every grotto and plant every grove
to shout on the mountain top or bellow up the cone
of etna putting aside the sportiveness of imagin
ation which wantoned in the inventing of fantastical
beings it is clear that the sort of causation which
first offers itself to the uncultivated mind is that
which depends on life and on will to which accord
ingly in the first instance we are disposed to refer
all events that seem to need being accounted for at
all
more accurate research teaches us to ask the causes
of many things which the less observant intellect
passes by it is soon evident that mere will is not
sufficient to generate at all times the same power in
our limbs the straining of a sinew makes a strong



cause and effect

man weak and it thus is shown us that intermediate
causes exist linking that which we have hitherto
called a cause to its effect the number of these
intermediate links it concerns us not to determine
but this point is of much importance that we are
now led to a new sort of causation in which will has
no share for if any one in defence of a hypothesis
were to maintain that the power of a muscle to
contract is a cause similar in kind to the actings of
the will it is easy when once set on this argument
to adduce numberless instances of causes perfectly
different from the latter all substances have quali
ties on the action of which we can count thus gum
and glue are adhesive and by help of them we can
stick paper or wood together if it be questioned
whether the cause be in the gum or in the paper we
may reply in both for there is an adaptation of the
one to the other it is wasting ingenuity to discuss
which is active and which passive it is enough that
we can pronounce that power resides in that which
has no life and no will a yet more striking case is
in the inanimate forces which produce motion if
the stone which so early attracted the interest of
philosophers and the amazement of the vulgarÃ¢€”the
loadstoneÃ¢€”be moved about under a thin tray it will
cause corresponding motions in steel filings placed in
the tray here it is the will of the experimenter
which primarily causes the motion but the properties
or powers residing in matter are the secondary causes
no peculiarity seems more to distinguish the human
mind from the faculties of brutes than the disposition
to search after causes a tendency which is increased

causation



by cultivation but as was said an unsound mind
does not know where to stop and in many acute
persons the passion for the investigation of causes
is so keen that they are apt to forget first thoroughly
to ascertain the truth of the fact for which they want
to account
felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas 
charles the second is said i know not on what
authority to have puzzled the savans of his day by
the question why a dead fish is heavier than a live
one and large books are written nay long jour
neys taken to ascertain the abode of the lost ten
tribes omitting first to establish that they have
ever been lost at all thus the mind wastes its
powers and efforts by neglecting the precaution
of making good its ground before passing beyond
most sham sciences deal largely in chains of causes
to account for that which does not exist and owe
their power to deceive very much to keeping the
mind thus fully employed
vocabulary of causation
this is perhaps the place for remarking on the
vocabulary used by philosophers on these subjects
i when a series of causes exist each giving rise to
the next and ending in some phenomenon all but
the first are named intermediate or second causes
the term second causes is however peculiarly used
in theology in contrast to the deity considering him
as the universal first cause all others are called
second causes but when we are satisfied to rest in



causation

less arduous speculations human will is fairly con
sidered a first cause to which we may trace events
again when it is notoriously hopeless to find the
cause of a cause we rest in it as an ultimate fact
thus if a volcano overwhelm a city we may reckon
it as emphatically the cause of the whole series of
following events similarly the force of gravity
joined with a primitive impulse is the cause of the
planetary movements and this must be received as
the last step in the series of causation
ii but the human intellect once set on specu
lating loves not thus to stop and justly regarding
the whole material universe as a result of the cre
ators will takes another step farther back and
assigns reasons which may be supposed to have
actuated him as causes of the natural laws of the
universe or peculiarities of individual objects but
it has been a source of much confusion and frequent
false philosophy to speak thus to discriminate
causes from reasons the former have been called
efficient causes or physical causes the latter
final causes efficient cause appears to be re
dundant as though one should say causing cause 
for which reason physical cause may be preferable
a yet more unenglish use of the word cause is
when it is said by the schoolmen that wood is the
material cause of a door by final cause is
n the term final cause has taken too deep root to be exter
minated but the popular terms reason intention appear to
express the thing well enough as will also the end in view
the aristotelians speak also of the fortnal cause an expression
which cannot be understood without an insight into their pecu
liar views

causation



understood that some end in view exercises an
influence over the mind and acts upon it efficiently
the term motive indicates a similar apprehension
the final cause is in reality the desire of producing a
certain effect
the aristotelic school is accused of having cor
rupted natural philosophy by introducing final causes
into it on which point bacon often attacks them
the truth seems to be that such considerations are
excellent in place but presumptuous and foolish
when premature to speculate on the purposes and
motives of the deity is an easy task to every foolish
person and the lazy mind readily betakes itself to this
method rather than to inquiry into fact men even
of education in modern times have persuaded them
selves that the tendency of population to increase
depends on the proportion which the existing popu
lation bears to the land and diminishes with its
density and why because else it might happen
that more mouths would be born than there is bread
to feed them with which they judge is incompati
ble with the attributes of the deity now there is
nothing wrong in reasoning from his goodness but
it is wrong to think that we have such an insight into
his mind as to be able to predict how he will act
much more is it wrong to shut our eyes to facts
that lie the other way nay and neglect inquiries
that are within our reach and that might settle the
question thus it is not the study of final causes
that corrupts natural philosophy or history any
more than it corrupts morals or religion but in all
these subjects it is good when well used and this
v



causation

is generally rather at the end than at the beginning
of our inquiries and in all these subjects it is always
a dangerous mode of reasoning because it so flatters
our vanity and idleness by enabling us to dispense
with examination
 it is common with philosophers of a certain
class observes dr prichard who pride them
selves upon being strict logicians to disavow and
treat with contempt all reasonings which refer to
final causes or otherwise to the apparent ends
and purposes for which particular arrangements
appear to have been adopted and contrived by
nature or rather by providence for this they
quote the authority of lord bacon who can never
have intended that such a construction should be
laid on his words it must be confessed that the
doctrine of final causes has been on some occasions
strangely abused and misapplied in a most ridiculous
manner as for example by a writer on anatomy
who fancied that the os unguis a bone near the
inner angle of the orbit of the eye was purposely
made by nature thin in order that it might the
more easily be perforated by surgeons in the ope
ration for fistula lachrymalis but the perversion
of sound reason in the hands of weak and ignorant
persons is neither a new thing nor does it carry any
weight on the score of argument we may safely
conclude that the theory of final causes or the
inquiry into the beneficial results which arise from
the arrangements of nature will never be laid aside
 on a vital principle p 

cadsation



in physiology or in the study of the organized works
of creation for we cannot advance a single step
without its aid and it affords when skilfully pur
sued a species of evidence entirely convincing and
conclusive as far as arguments derived from the
most striking and extensive analogies can be con
clusive cuvier throughout his works has made a
most happy use of it
these remarks were elicited from the esteemed
writer by a very interesting example of this nature
in which cuvier had inferred from final causes
that animals destitute of the power of selfmotion
are without sensation an inference confirmed by
their want of nerves from which circumstance la
marck drew the very same result as cuvier had
otherwise drawn but we may add that the fanciful
anatomist above reproved would have committed a
far more serious fault if instead of accounting as he
did for the thinness of that particular bone he
had undertaken to prove that the bone was thin
either while neglecting to examine it or in a case
where examination was impossible if the fact ac
counted for is otherwise proved the argument of
final causes even when ill founded is comparatively
harmless
but the last words quoted from dr prichard may
be further commented on such evidence he says
 is convincing and conclusive as far as arguments
derived from the most striking and extensive analo
gies can be conclusive this is the very point
the mere beginner has no right to deal with the
argument it belongs to an advanced stage of the



causation

science extensive observation has already esta
blished the fact that all organized beings are re
markably adapted to their situation and provision
made for their wants and dangers it is the previous
knowledge of this as a general truth which justified
baron cuvier in reasoning from it to the particular
case thus his argument is rightly resolved into
induction or analogy
again if the anatomist could truly allege that
the construction of the human frame showed in a
thousand instances a provision made to facilitate
surgical operations no one would call it absurd to
assign such a reason for the thinness of the os
unguis nor would it even seem very rash to assert
previous to a knowledge of the fact that such bone
must needs be thin if the great importance of the
operation had already been established and that the
thinness of the bone was nearly an essential condition
of success
enough has been said to show that reasoning
from final causes is good or bad according as it is
used that its force when good is to be referred
to some other head as to induction or extensive
analogy thus it is not to be looked on as any new
kind of reasoning
iii another use of the word cause is in the
expressions immediate or proximate cause and pre
disposing cause a variety of circumstances may
help tpwards a result which yet could never have
produced it and without which the result might
have happened these are named predisposing
causes while that true or efficient cause which

causation



as far as can be ascertained is most closely followed
by the result is named the immediate cause thus
it might be said that the immediate cause of the
british american revolution was the imposition of
a tax on tea but the predisposing causes were the
vexatious restrictions to which we subjected their
commerce in human life it is obvious that the im
mediate causes of events are often of very secondary
importance for if the predisposing causes are very
powerful any trifle may serve as a spark to fire the
train
iv the terms occasion and condition are like
wise used in connection with causes but not with
great uniformity a condition as opposed to a
cause means something essential to a result yet not
capable of producing that result perhaps even quite
unconnected with it thus food and sleep are con
ditions of health but not causes of it dr whately
has the following singular illustration that it is a
 condition of a mans dying on the tuesday that
he had been alive on the monday yet in truth
this sense of the word condition is generally awk
ward and cannot easily become popular because the
other meaning state so preoccupies it and the
adjectives essential necessary requisite will nearly
always enable us to dispense with it thus we say a
prerequisite
it is not uncommon to hear it said that christi
anity was the occasion of many wars and other
miseries but ought not to be called the cause of
them by this is intended to imply that it was
passive and not active it had no tendency to pro



causation

duce such results but others took it up and made it
an instrument but perhaps the term occasion
cannot be subjected to any limitation precise enough
to be of philosophical utility
v lastly the words cause and reason are often
opposed the former being a thing or event which
draws after it a physical effect the latter being a
proposition which warrants a logical inference thus
an effect may be our reason for believing in a cause
equally as a cause may be our reason for expecting
or counting on an effect the contrast of cause and
reason has been illustrated thus it twinkles be
cause it is a star this tells the cause again 
 it is a star since it twinkles this tells the reason
yet we cannot tie up language to this strictness
we are accustomed to employ the word because as
equivalent to by reason that inasmuch as a reason
is looked on as the cause being at least a means
of knowledge thus it is a star because it
twinkles is elliptical for know that it is a
star because or by reason of its twinkling
it has been above remarked that reason is also
employed for the end in view if it be said that
the reason of our lower limbs being so disproportionate
to the upper is that we are meant to be bipeds and
not quadrupeds this states the intention or end in
view but if we allege a reason for believing any
thing this does not imply an intention but a
warrant or valid ground
it is in the effort to evade these ambiguities that
a philosophical nomenclature is formed yet it is
hopeless that either the vulgar or even the philoso

argument

ill

phers themselves should ever attain the habit of
confining one word to one meaning the chief ob
ject really gained is the habit of closely investigating
our own meaning whenever we are about to draw an
inference and the ability to speak with great pre
cision on the occasions when we are particularly
afraid of being misunderstood
arguments k priori and a posteriori
it has been remarked above that we may with
equal propriety adduce a cause as a reason for ex
pecting an effect or an effect as a reason for be
lieving that a particular cause preceded whenever
the events in which a cause consists and those also
which will be its effects are thoroughly ascertained
both modes of reasoning are equally logical thus
in the exact sciences as in astronomy the argument
is not less perfect by which an eclipse is predicted
than that by which the mass of the moon is ascer
tained but in a majority of instances it seems to be
easier to argue from effect to cause than from
cause to effect if several billiard balls are rolled
on a table and the ball a strike b and next strike
c this is an event which only a practised eye could
have anticipated but after it has happened it is
obvious to infer that the resistance which b exerted
on a is that which caused a to rebound and strike
c so in the conflict of political parties it may be
difficult to foresee which will prevail and the general
turn which affairs will take but perhaps not dif
ficult with ordinary diligence to trace out the causes



argument

of the result after the result has happened to
reason then from cause to effect is generally re
garded and rightly as far more unsafe than the
converse unsafe because it requires more extensive
and accurate knowledge and far greater powers of
mind to combine aright all that knowledge so as to
make it available this mode of arguing towards
the future is generally denoted by the latin term
a priori reasoning and is contrasted with a poste
riori
if however in the case of the billiard balls the
problem were proposed thus given the positions
directions and velocities with which a b c collide
to find their previous velocities in certain positions
this although an a posteriori question is not at all
easier than the a priori the same is apparent in
all questions where absolute accuracy is demanded
again if an englishman were suddenly transported
into china and had imparted to him the fullest
knowledge of the present state of things suppose as
to political struggles he would find it as hard to
infer what causes last year produced what he sees
as what effects next year will follow from what he
sees it is not then to be supposed that there is any
greater natural facility in reasoning from cause to
effect than from effect to cause but the principal
difference consists in this that he who argues a
posteriori has generally more facts to argue from
he not only has information of the present but some
record of the past while of the future there is no
record at all to help the a priori reasoner in astro
nomy there is no record of the past beyond about

two thousand years hence he who wishes to reason
back to an earlier period evidently has a problem of
the same nature and difficulty as one who is reasoning
onward to the future
on humes question
mr humes speculations have given celebrity to
the question why it is that because the sun has
risen today we expect it to rise tomorrow which
question dr brown has renewed and with deference
to his ingenuity must profess that i think he has
done his best to puzzle and mislead his readers ac
cording to him the recurrence of an event 
times gives no better reason for expecting it once
more than its occurrence on one occasion gives for
expecting it a second time which is true in some
cases but not in most to which it has been applied
he alleges that only intuition guides us to our
result i have already adverted to the instinctive
principle of association which leads us to expect a
second time a union of circumstances which has been
experienced once this is all that i can conceive dr
brown to mean by intuition yet the principle
though instinctive is by no means irresistible but
is capable of being either modified or overcome
something may be said for mr hume in this matter
but nothing as i think for dr brown it is pro
bable that men in general do take up their expect
ations merely as a result of habit which is mr
humes view if a child finds a bag with marbles
in it and takes out which all prove white



humes question

he is perhaps confident that all the rest are white
though it should contain yet white ones may
have been laid at the top of the bag and the rest
may be red now the majority of men expect the
sun to rise and the seasons to recur in future as in
time past with no better grounds than the child had
in the other case for which reason also their con
fidence in the stability of nature is so easily shaken
and they are so credulous about miracles if a
peasant reads of a time when the sun did not rise
in england for thirtysix hours he perhaps easily
credits it nor is it any effort to his faith to believe
that the sun stood still in heaven at the command of
joshua the facility of his belief shows that he is
not irresistibly impelled to suppose the course of
nature invariable why is it harder to convince the
man of science because he is satisfied that the
observed uniformity of the seasons is reasonably im
puted to a cause that has substantive and permanent
existence and such a cause he will henceforward
presume to exist until it shall be testified not to
exist just as a man whom we saw alive yesterday
we presume to be alive today unless we have learned
of his death now we are unable to conceive of any
power capable of controlling the causes which regu
late the heavenly bodies except the great creator
himself hence the man of science is less easily
persuaded and needs full assurance that there is
adequate reason for believing such an interference
before he will give way the miracle is hard to his
faith which was easy to the peasant but it could
not be thus had not an amount of experience pre

laws of causation



ceded leading his mind to the formation of a general
law which explanation dr browns notion excludes

uniformity of the laws of causation
but it is asked whether that which follows is
linked to that which precedes by any invariable law
such as to enable a mind perfect in intelligence yet
constituted as our own minds infallibly to infer the
one from the other in the more obvious cases of
mechanical movements no one will doubt this after
a sportsman has brought to the ground his flying
game no one questions that could the following
data have been set before a perfect mathematician
the success of the shot might have been infallibly
predicted the birds course and velocity at every
instant the position and construction of the gun
quantity and nature of the charge the instant of
firing the resistance of the air we are then
persuaded that if the same causes were to act ten
thousand times over the same result would follow
this persuasion does not depend on any mysterious
intuition but by observation in numerous simple
cases experience shows that mere time affects no
change in the qualities of bodies and gives us every
reason to disbelieve that there is will in their parti
cles if the magnet attracted iron by means of the
action of its will perhaps tomorrow its will might be
altered but no such indication of arbitrary power in
the magnet to attract or not to attract is ever de
tected
it was once doubted whether the whole material



laws of causation

world was guided by unchanging laws the motions
of the heavenly bodies are referred by ancient philo
sophers either to necessity or to nature there
seems no practical difference but showers and fine
weather lightning and earthquakes they often
refer to chance the meaning of this seems to have
been that the result did not follow from any thing
else strictly as effect from cause by any law acting
invariably but that the same antecedent events
repeated in the same way might be followed by
different results enlarged experience has gradually
established the opposite belief in the modern world 
and that even where the powers of life are concerned
probably no physiologist will doubt whether it be
a strictly determinate problem in the language of
mathematicians to investigate the effect of a given
medicine administered to a given individual little as
we are likely ever to understand how medicines pro
duce their effects there is so vast a mass of evidence
that the results follow by a uniform law that we feel
justified in referring all anomalies to difference in the
prior circumstances
in the full and rigid notion then contained in the
words cause and effect it is essentially implied that
the cause infallibly draws the effect along with it 
that is if the same cause be repeated ever so often
all the circumstances being the same the same effect
will follow there is difficulty in stating this per
spicuously because the word same lays one open to
controversy in strictness it seems inaccurate if
several blows are given with a hammer to say that
the first blow is the same with the second blow yet

uniform sequence



if all the blows be in the same direction and with
the same velocity we may say that so far as the
blow can be a cause of any thing the blows are one
and all the same cause for they differ in nothing
but in time and this may be sufficient to avert
objections but farther we must beware of turning
our statement into a truism if we neglect to dis
criminate between the most rigid and the more
popular senses of the words cause and effect thus
if any one ask us why we believe that effect
follows cause in the material world by uniform
laws
we might be tempted to appeal to the very
definition of cause and effect to prove it but this
would turn it into a mere verbal truth and evade
the real question for the interrogator doubtless
means to ask why we believe that in the material
world all events follow one another by uniform laws
so as to be referable to a series of causes and
effectsuniform sequence
that a cause to be a cause must be such that
that which we call its effect shall uniformly follow
is manifest but that such uniform sequence is all
that we mean by causation is by no means manifest
yet this is reiterated a hundred times by dr brown
in his muchapplauded inquiry without giving
that i can find any proof of it but his own bare
assertion power says he is only a shorter
synonymous expression of invariableness of ante
cedence if this were ever so true it is hard to see



uniform sequence

wherein is the importance of this proposition or this
discovery to deserve a labored essay of pages
and stir up so much controversy but his assertion
seems to me to be a simple untruth it necessarily
confounds premonitory symptoms with causes for
example it is known that dying persons are often
affected with a gurgling in the throat vulgarly
called the deathrattle let it be supposed that
universal experience showed that death uniformly
followed this sound in less than twentyfour hours
and that the powers of life distinctly declined without
rallying from the moment it commenced should we
then instantly pronounce the sound the cause of
death certainly i for one should not it would
not suffice me to be able to say that death does
uniformly follow the sound i must also be able
to say that death must abstractedly and by the
very laws of nature follow to define what we
mean by this must and could is impossible but
i certainly feel that mean something beyond mere
 uniform sequence though i cannot answer for dr
brown perhaps he would prefer to maintain that
the rattle is the cause of death rather than give up
his theory i judge this by the defence he has made
against dr reids remark that night is not the
cause of day though it uniformly precedes dr
reid clearly meant that premonitory symptoms are
not always causes but dr brown has merely
evaded the remark by a sort of special pleading
about day and night
another awkward question would be how soon
must the afterevent follow to justify us in calling

second causes



the former a cause if this be left vague we are in
endless confusion thus since all men die after
speaking speaking is made out to be a cause of
death but it is obviously impossible to define any
time and the effort to fritter away our notion of
power into mere antecedence must even on this
ground alone be renounced
have second causes any substantive existence 
there is however another idea similar to this
which some have held from an excessive fear of its
being forgotten that all second causes are originally
dependent on the first great cause they allege
that in strictness he is himself the immediate agent
of every thing that no matter therefore is endued
with power to influence other matter but that on
each particular occasion where it seems to do so the
supreme being is pleased to act to such a result
thus food has no real tendency to feed nor wine to
intoxicate but when food is duly administered he
chooses to feed as ifhy it
such a view is not to be ridiculed for it is
prompted by pious intentions and has been held by
some great names but it certainly does not tend to
piety pushed to its just results it seems to convert
the deity into a mere soul of the world it really
divests him of all will in representing his will as sub
jected to that of his meanest creatures for according
to it any wicked man at pleasure sets the deity at work
to perform the mans base purposes the tendency
of such an opinion is through pantheism into atheism



will

moreover in another point of view the tendency is
to universal scepticism by representing that none of
the things which seem to be are and that the only
real agent is one whose agency we infer by means of
apparent but unreal agencies for we arrive at a
knowledge of the great first cause only by reason
ing upward from the second causes and whatever
goes to deny the reality of the second cause saps our
belief of the first
it must then suffice us to rest in believing that for
his own wise purposes it has pleased him to impress
permanently upon matter certain laws which now act
without him act uniformly and determinately so
that after any phenomenon of the material universe has
happened be it an eclipse an earthquake or a
thunderstorm we may say it could not but be
provided only its scale of action be too large to be
affected by the efforts of living creatures
will an originating cause
but now we have to turn to another side of the
subject it having been so extensively ascertained
that in the material world the results are inevitably
determined by the antecedents the speculating mind
pushes on farther and desires to extend the same to
all results whatever such is the doctrine of philo
sophical necessity it represents what is called a
motive as having when held up before the mind a
causative power determinately impelling the will
which is swayed by opposite forces and necessarily
carried off by the more powerful a peach presented

will



to the eyes of a greedy boy thus constrains him to eat
it up the argument is clearly stated by aristotle p
but his reply is by no means satisfactory though
he appears perfectly to have discerned the fallacy
mr dugald stewart has exposed it as i think
unanswerably and in very few words he says that
the proposition men always act upon the strongest
 motive is a mere truism if that motive is to be
called strongest in each particular case on which
they do act in that case but if any absolute measure
of the word strongest be employed the proposition is
evidently false for what is the strongest today may
prove the weakest tomorrow in short a motive
is not a cause because its power to sway the will is
not wholly independent of the will itself but the
will determines which of many motives shall prove
strongest
the plausibility of the opposite argument depends
on this that the active power of the will lies only
within certain limits motives are readily conceiv
able so numerous and attractive that but a small
fraction of human minds would resist them nor is it
in our power by an act of the will to invest objects at
pleasure with lovely or hateful qualities moreover
habits of mind act almost according to mechanical
laws when once formed and so far go to destroy
the active powers of the will this gives speciousness
to the argument for necessity but after the utmost
concessions have been made no more can be inferred
than that some motives are so universally powerful
that almost none can resist them and here we find
 nicom ethics book iii ch 
a



will

little scope for blame much for praise or conversely
much for blame and little for praise such are the
actions which aristotle refers to the excesses of virtue
and vice some vices are so atrocious or so gross
and have so little temptation to a mind not horribly
depraved that almost all will be swayed by the enor
mously superior motives for avoiding them thus
no son is praised for not strangling his aged father 
but he who does it is abhorred contrariwise no
one would be much blamed for stealing to save his
wife and family from starving but he who refrained
would be highly commended if he were believed to
have strong affection with it these examples how 
ever have really nothing in them to oppose the belief
that will is not merely passive for in fact there
are no temptations so overwhelming but that some
human virtue has been found to resist them there
will remain a thousand other motives of less cogent
influence and between which the human will freely
moves neither wholly determined by them nor per
fectly independent of them herein lies the diversity
and the trial of moral character and here is found
scope for approbation or condemnation for a peaceful
conscience or remorse fully to explain this topic
belongs to ethics not to logic and perhaps too
much has already been said but it seemed necessary
to bring out strongly the difference of causation in
the material world from the actings of motives on
the will bp butler has directed one chapter of his
 analogy which is in my opinion the most mas
terly chapter in the book against the doctrine of
fatalism his attack on it is very indirect and pro

will



ceeds on the most cautious grounds with the smallest
possible assumptions and is for this reason so pecu
liarly unanswerable he satisfies himself with prov
ing that if his view of the matter be not true yet a
man who acts as if it were true will be likely to act
wisely while if the doctrine of fatalism be true yet a
man who acts on the belief of its truth will act as a
fool and with this result he dismisses the subject
although i apprehend that a motive cannot justly
be named a cause as it does not inevitably influence
the will yet the will itself may be rightly entitled a
cause of a mans own actions so far as they are purely
voluntary we thus have two kinds of causes the
one sort selforiginated or selfadjusting the other
sort themselves effects of something that preceded
and the axiom that the same causes produce the
same effects cannot be held as a certain truth as
regards the former
the distinction which we are drawing was familiar
to aristotler who perpetually refers to two classes of
events or actions which he calls necessary and
contingent under the contingent he principally
considers human action but it appears that he
supposed some parts of the material world as winds
showers c to fall under the same head
 h ji tmautj
attaiim all the socratic school seem to
have been very clear on this point plato and cicero probably
meant no more than this by the phrase from which we shrink
that man is a sort of little god viz as a first cause of his own
actions the christian fathers and especially of the greek
church are reproved by calvin for holding the same view
even augustine according to him was here in error
g 



motives
reasoning from motives

it was stated that the term a priori reasoning was
applied to the argument from cause to effect we
may now add that the same name is naturally given
to the argument from motive to action this sort of
reasoning must obviously be yet more unsafe if it stand
alone since the motives do not even determine the
action nevertheless in each case the negative argu
ment is felt to be stronger than the positive we
distrust the reasoning which alleges that something
will happen because we see causes or motives much
more than that which says it will not happen or did
not happen because there are no perceptible causes
or motives for though it is not certain that an
event will take place though there be numerous
motives and predisposing causes yet without these
we feel it incredible that any events of magnitude
can happen thus the a priori topics though un
availing to establish matters when they stand alone
are often powerful to confirm and formidable as ob
jections in theology we cannot dispense with argu
ments from final causes which really are a priori
investigations whether motives are imputable to the
supreme being that could lead him to such or such
conduct before miracles can have power of con
vincing we need to believe the veracity of the divine
being which is demonstrated by a negative argu
ment he cannot lie because there is no im
putable motive to this we give way but if any
argue that he will do so and so because of motives
and character which we feel justified in attributing

motives



to him the vanity of the inference is apparent
indeed it would imply that we are equal to him in
wisdom if we can dictate the particular line of action
that he will follow
the case is the same in judging of our fellowcreatures we may in numerous instances judge
with much certainty of their characters from their
actions but we can seldom predict their actions
from their characters this remark helps us to
draw the line as to the class of doctrines on which
divine revelation is indispensable however rare the
attainment it is not above the human faculties to
attain from nature a just knowledge of the character
of the divine being it may be gathered from his
works as we may learn the character of a legislator
and a sovereign from his laws institutions and edicts
but how the sovereign will act towards individual
culprits if the law have stated nothing we can but
 guess and whether the deity will or will not give
us any life after this whether he will forgive or
punish make us happy or leave us to be miserable 
on all these points we can guess but nothing more
i unless he send to tell us
i
finally it will be observed that less direct evi
dence suffices to establish facts which have an a priori
probability else we should as readily believe a base
story propagated against a man of known virtue as
against a notorious villain and so stands the case
as regards marvellous tales affecting the supernatural
we certainly must not entirely judge of professed
miracles by the doctrine which they are attesting
yet neither can we leave this out of the consideration

contingent matter
we should be right in demanding more evidence for
a common ghost story than for a miracle of high
moral and religious import and we are justified in
believing on comparatively slight evidence a tenth
miracle attributed to a man whom we already believe
to have wrought nine the d priori improbability
has here been broken down
on reasoning in contingent matter generally
adopting the aristotelic term contingent matter
it may now be asked whether the sort of probability
attainable in it differs from that attainable in neces
sary matter even in the latter it was shown that
no induction was more than a highly probable argu
ment but still it appears that truths do exist in the
material world for by induction we obtain proposi
tions with absolutely no exceptions whatever since
at least no research succeeds in detecting them but
in contingent matter it might seem doutbful whether
any such propositions exist for human will is Ã¢
capricious or so selfdetermining that none stand uni
versally not even the love of life the dread of
pain tenderness for offspring nor any other motive
that can be named acts with entire uniformity 
hence it would seem that no accumulation of ex
perience no successive approximations and corrections
will ever reduce the knowledge of human nature to
one of the exact sciences nearly similar remarks
seem to apply to medical knowledge so far as
human caprices influence the physical state of indi
viduals

contingent matter
nevertheless there is a strong analogy between the
study of those branches of nature which the ancients
referred to chance and the proceedings of human
life that which we call knowledge of the world
and of human character which enables the states
man to foresee the times that are coming or to choose
fit instruments for his purposes is an acquirement
very similar to the foresight of weather attained by a
practised seaman neither knows by what process his
mind arrives at its conclusions and to others it may
seem a sort of divination nearly the same remark will
apply to the prognostics of a physicianÃ¢€”but again
when meteorology is taken up systematically as a
science of observation accurate registers are kept of
the depth of rain of the moisture heat atmospheric
pressure magnetic and electric conditions c re
sults are hereby attained which no one would other
wise have guessed at not that such registers will
enable the philosopher to predict the weather to
morrow or next day at least in an insular climate
but it establishes various results as to the mean state
and though this mean state may have a secular
variation as we know that in the course of ages the
climates of particular districts change yet it is
generally eo gradual that the experience of the past
is available for reasoning towards the future the
unscientific observer for example the experienced
seaman is too much embarassed by the hourly
changes to disentangle the monthly and annual
changes so that generally his wisdom serves only
to enable him to see danger a few hours before it
comes and is seldom capable of looking far onwardÃ¢€”

now what the meteorological registerand tidegauge
are to the philosopher such are statistics or moral
and political registers to the statesman though
individual wills are free yet each man has a character
of his own that character seldom changes very
rapidly and far more certain is it that the character
of a nation does not ordinarily change rapidly the
actions of individuals may be compared to the daily
showers and heat the annual actions of the mass to
the mean annual rain or heat and the few attempts
already made to compile tables of this nature show
how strikingly the analogy holds for one eccentric
mind there are twenty ordinary ones where one
breaks suddenly into a new course twenty keep on
their old course thus there is a stability in the mass
for good or for evil in the moral statistics of
france by m guerry it is alleged that every
year sees the same number of crimes reproduced in
the same order in the same districts every class of
crimes has its particular and invariable distribution
by sex age and season all are accompanied in like
proportions with accessory facts indifferent in ap
pearance and of which nothing as yet explains the
return possibly the writer may be suspected of
exaggeration yet it is only what we might expect
if no new agencies were at work rapidly to change
the character of the people that there would be
certain mean states on each side of which the registers
would slightly oscillate
it cannot be doubted that all enlarged legislation
has been hitherto mere guess work in comparison to
 quoted in the western journal jan 

contingent matter



what it might be and perhaps will be when statistics
are greatly advanced the chief art of the statesman
has lain in foreseeing sudden squalls in knowing
when to venture boldly to sea and when to run for
port it has been a series of temporary shifts and ex
pedients with almost nothing based on principle
many have displayed great sagacity in gaining im
mediate advantages over rivals and in carrying their
selfish ends of momentary aggrandisement few very
few have known how to do real good to their subjects
or have been aware how the current of events was
drifting them hence often they have been like a
navigator who puts to sea against the tradewind
opposing his puny force and skill to an overwhelming
natural agent an upright mind a pure heart may
furnish a legislator with sound moral principles but
no machinery can be devised that will work well
which is not based on an accurate knowledge of the
physical and moral state of a population it is won
derful to think how modern is this discovery
yet no statistical enquiries supersede that other
and more individual faculty which has to study in
dividual character could we by extensive inquiry
ascertain that the average probity of lawyers is as
the world seems to think exceedingly low this would
not justify us in judging of individuals by this stand
ard but when we had more direct means of knowing the character of an individual we should of
course use those means but prudence consists in
having both sound views as to the average qualities
of men so as to give us a clue how to deal with
individuals perfectly unknown and also discernment
c

iso

contingent matter

as to the individuals with whom we come more im
mediately into contact these two branches nearly
mark out theoretic and practical prudence neither
of which will enable us to dispose with the other
the observations which we have been making have
referred to one branch of contingent matter namely
that with which the statesman is chiefly concerned
but it will be obvious that all the topics are applica
ble alike to every other kindred subject and the
general conclusion is that in the view of a logician
all problems which have to do with matter really
contingent are perfectly similar in kind with such
as are abstractedly determinate but by reason of
our limited knowledge indeterminate viz when we
cannot learn all the data and are forced to omit the
consideration of minor disturbing forces in this
case we of course get chiefly average results
but if this were all our knowledge would remain
very imperfect since we cannot tell the limits of
error or of deviation from the mean state an en
quiry sometimes even more important than the other
to obtain these the disturbing forces entirely left
out before must be supposed to exert their greatest
action just as in enquiries concerning the tides we
learn the highest and lowest water mark as well as
the average state a large number of the enquiries
set on foot in contingent matter admit of a limit on
each side the strength stature speed and longevity
of men may be increased or diminished by art but
obviously the limit of possible increase is not very
distant nearly the same thing applies to the powers
of the mind but not so obviously if reference be

chance



made to the age and nation in which an individual
appears that is to say very few rise above their
contemporaries through more than a moderate in
terval as to moral qualifications less can be said
on this head perhaps we shall never get any mea
sure of them such as will enable us to pronounce
this however is visible that there is a certain rela
tion and proportion between the means used for
improving the moral condition of a population and
the result obtained and without rashness we may
say that omitting a small percentage of mankind
who most unexpectedly rise far beyond their fellows
the characters of the rest vary to no great distance
on each side of the average mark which would cor
respond to the means used for influencing them so
much is stated merely to show what sort of analogy
would exist between investigations of this nature and
those which have less to do with the mind and will
but the whole science if such it is to be called is as
yet quite in its infancy
this is the place to remark the use of the word
moral in the phrases moral impossibility moral
evidence and such like it implies that in conse
quence of the arbitrary actings of will less uni
formity exists in the moral than in the material
world yet that the impossibility or the evidence
is such as alone can be looked for in contingent
matter
chance
the ancients were used formally to class chance
among the causes of things the moderns have



chancfc

been so shocked and disgusted by the use of the
argument which atheists have made that many re
ligious persons consider the very word an offence
perhaps an impiety yet there certainly is an in
offensive use of it as if any one who trod on his
neighbours foot should say i beg your pardon
i did it by chance he would not intend to deny the
divine superintendence but merely to assert that he
did it without design
that living agents do ten thousand things without
design we well know and we know also that we
may try to do a thing fifty times and succeed but
once and this is popularly called chance when
any matter of great importance is involved it is un
doubtedly most comforting to be allowed to believe
that the divine hand has directed it a certain man
drew a bow at a venture and killed king ahab
another has been through hairbreadth dangers and
come off safe a third has avoided drowning by
some accidental detention it is certainly impossible
to attribute to the most high a perfect foreknow
ledge of all these things and yet deny that he ex
ercises any sort of superintendence over them with
out impairing the belief that he is concerned for our
welfare and thus damping the vigor of real piety
but let it be observed that this remark will apply
alike to the things which happen by chance and
those which happen by design it is to the full as
necessary that the burning of a martyr be under his
superintendence as the death of one who is acci
dentally shot by his friend i cannot go into the
question at large without quitting my proper sub

chance



ject but must content myself with adding that the
whole question seems to resolve itself into the deep
mystery of prescience and predestination
while also we allow that it would be an imperfec
tion in the supreme being not to attend to the
occurrences in which those are interested for whom
he professes his most special care we may propose
the question whether there are not numberless other
points in which it might be a degradation to suppose
that he can be interested take a case of deviation
from the order of nature established by him if a
monstrous birth of some animal is produced incapa
ble of living would it tend to pious notions to
insist that this was by his determinate counsel and
forearrangement and not by chance or when a
river carries rocks into the plain is it requisite to say
that the great disposer of events had a special object
in settling one block of stone here and one there 
next year to be carried away doubtless he may
have had some definite object but in defect of proof
that he had have we any right to allege that he
had or is it not more cautious and more reverential
to say that generally he arranged and determined
certain laws by which the surface of the earth should
be eraded and renewed that the stones and earth
must be carried down somehow and somewhere but
that as to the particulars we cannot say that he
preferred one way to another would it not be
rather an imperfection than a perfection in his
character if he could not help interfering to decide
matters so trivial that it would be beneath any
rational creature to interest himself about them 




chance

however this may be it would seem dear that
we are not justified in so enforcing the doctrine of
a special providence as to invalidate the mathema
tical doctrine of chance as applicable to throwing the
dice to taking balls out of a bag or samples of
wheat the utility of which doctrine daily experience
witnesses and on which as has been explained the
verification of general propositions entirely depends
a theologian who in such matters wars against science
by texts of scripture is in danger of helping the
cause of infidelity
having said thus much i must add that i think
there is nothing in the scripture soberly expounded
to enforce such a view
it is not unimportant to observe that an improba
bility dependent on the doctrine of chances though
obviously involving no physical difliculty at all may
be as untenable to the mind as any of the things
called physically impossible for a man to fly in
the air or breathe water we call physically impossi
ble as being violations of the laws of nature
yet are they quite as credible as that some com
binations of throws should be made by dice to take
an illustration from another subject which may be
more forcible to those whose minds are not exercised
in mathematical ideas of chance if two travellers
gave similar stories of the countries they had visited
agreeing in numerous details of the manners and
customs houses costumes food scenery c which
they professed to have seen we might indeed possi
bly disbelieve them we might say that they had
copied each other or had drawn from a common

chance
source but no one would say that by independent
invention they had hit on the same tale the
supposition would be so outrageous that any phy
sical miracle as a divine revelation to each would
be believed in preference in fact in the case of
a miracle the violated law of nature is only
proved to be a law at all by assuming the incre
dibility of analogous combinations of chances

calculations of chances
for many important commercial purposes espe
cially life annuities and insurances the mathema
tical doctrine of chances is indispensable but some
able philosophers have thought that in numerous
other arguments where chances are involved it is
possible to turn mathematical computations to account
la place was i believe the first to adventure this
by his powerful engine of calculation called by him
the analytical calculus of probabilities he first
addressed himself to astronomical questions of this
nature and i am not aware that the most eminent
modern astronomers question the justice of his rea
sonings among other points he made it a matter
of computation whether the inclination of the orbits
of the larger planets be attributable to chance or to
a definite cause and finds that it is ten million to
one in favor of the latter it is somewhat hard to
get at the bottom of the meaning it being granted
that we may without impiety speak of double flowers
and other monstrous productions as those of chance
meaning that the deity chose to leave some of these



chance

minor matters to rise out of physical agencies and
that he determined to determine nothing by any
special act of his will the question then is whether
the small inclination of the planetary orbits is of this
character or not and la places result is if i
understand that it is reasonable to believe that the
deity had some specific intention in this case if he
do not mean this i cannot tell what he meant he
next applied the same principles to human testimony
to explain this let it be supposed that of ten
assertions made one is false and that a mathema
tician then endeavors to calculate the probability
that a story is true which has passed through twenty
mouths this may suffice just to give an idea of the
manner in which la place unhappily endeavoured to
throw discredit on the scripture narratives of mira
cles adding the improbability that the story could
have been correctly reported to the improbability
of the tale itself our visitor mr conybeare has
likewise proposed a new use of the doctrine of
chances in lectures delivered within these walls 
lectures whose increasing circulation shows how
they are appreciated by the public i am sorry that
the only call that i have to notice his book is to say
that i have not been able to satisfy myself that
numerical calculation will help us in reasonings con
cerning philology
it is however certain that in philological specula
tions we are encompassed with considerations de
pendent on chances i will venture one illustration
on finding the greek word xoixoj to mean hollow
probably no one is disposed to make a remark but

chance



if it be pointed out that koil and holl are somewhat
similar he will reply that it is a chance similarity
and not very strong either but no more than may
be expected or fancied in numerous instances next
show him xagsia and heart and he will make nearly
the same answer then show him cornu and horn 
and he will begin to think there is something in it
lastly put the following table before him 

cornuÃ¢€”horn
kotxifaosÃ¢€”halm
xotkosÃ¢€”hole
canvas

germ hauf xin hunt

and if his mind have had any exercise in etymological
enquiries he will inevitably abandon all idea of the
coincidences springing from chance the separate
instances are all possible but the combination is
impossible the mind deduces here a general pro
position that the northern languages often have
initial h where the southern have initial k which
is verified in too many samples to be rejected and
the argument thus ultimately comes back to an
induction
the numerical estimate of a chance will vary in
the very same phenomenon with the measure of
information which we may have thus if a man



chance

have two dice of which one is loaded so as to fall
with the six uppermost and he ask two spectators
what is the chance of his throwing sixes the one
answers it is as one to thirtysix who does not know
that the die is loaded the other who knows it
replies as one to six now as our knowledge of
natural causes is infinitely deficient it would seem
that the computation is not to be depended on
except where the chance is excessively infinitesimal 
giving so abundant a refutation to the idea of mere
chance as that we may suppose enormous omissions
in our data and the result remain as before and
these seem to be the cases in which common sense
s unices to decide
the doctrine of chance having been pressed into
the service of atheism is regarded by many with
extreme dislike i think however that it is perfectly
unavailable for the purposes of modern atheism in
short that the atheist who holds a train of causes
reaching back through all eternity having no begin
ning and imputable to no design is just the very
man who has no right to speak of chance at all
suppose this had been la places doctrine as in
fact perhaps it was and consider what he could
then mean by his result about the planetary orbits
when we attempt to analyze the assertion it seems
to imply that just as we say it is an equal chance
which side of the die shall turn up so we may say
it was an equal chance in what place the orbits of
the planets should lie but this is impossible if the
series of causes had no beginning chance pre
supposes uncertainty and equal possibilities this way

combined reasoning



or that way where nothing is nor ever was con
tingent on futurity it seems as unmeaning to talk of
chance as to ask the possibility of a past fact or the
probability of a known truth the mind can only
attempt it by looking back to a time when it was
alike possible that the fact might happen and that it
might not happen or alike credible that the propo
sition might prove false and that it might prove
true if la place can look back to a time when
it was as possible that the planetary orbits should
take one plane as another he implies the temporal
nature of the physical causes which have made this
world what it is and makes it necessary to refer the
existing system to something else than the uncon
scious agency of matter if he can not look back to
such a time all pretence for a calculation of chances
is excluded and the mind is shut up into the vague
but overwhelming idea of an eternal necessity
thus i say that the atheist who so deals in
chance as a cause of events is the very person who
has no right to talk of chance at all it does not
seem possible even to make a statement such as to
be i do not say true but intelligible by which on
his system chance should be a cause of the universe
combined reasonings
every instance in which a general proposition
comes out true might in a certain sense be called
an argument to prove this general proposition and
thus every induction would be a system of combined
arguments but it is not usual so to regard them



combined reasoning

contrariwise various independent chains of reasoning
may terminate in the same conclusion while it is
hardly possible to arrange them as an induction at all
the combined reasonings may in fact give such force
to the conclusion that we hold it as far more strongly
proved than the premisses from which it is derived
yet here again as in induction the doctrine of the
chances is the whole ground of our conviction
suppose a number of witnesses separately to depose
various facts disgraceful to the character of a certain
party each witness separately may be regarded as
capable of lying and we may have no very strong
conviction of the truth of any one particular depo
sition yet if no conspiracy were conceivable nor
any cause of general hatred and malice we might be
unable to resist the conclusion that the individual
accused was not the virtuous man that we had
thought him this is no induction it is not a
verification of a general principle for the result
does not include the premisses as particular cases
and indeed no one of the details is separately sub
stantiated it does therefore seem to be funda
mentally a new species of argument
there is then a sense in which it is true that
 many bad arguments amount to one good argu
ment if by bad be understood merely weak just
so do many pence gradually amount to pounds
though in this case it is by addition in the chances
by multiplication but as many losses will not make
one gain so neither will many bad arguments make
one that is good if by bad we mean an argument which
makes as much for the adversary as for ones self

combined reasoning



it is certainly a very common fallacy in popular
addresses to make a great parade of numerous topics
all converging to the same result when the whole is
worthless the plausibility of it turns on this 
that the reasoner seems to have a great deal to say
for himself that the multitude of men are soon
tired in the effort to sift all the particulars and are
led to take for granted that each reason confidently
alleged is good as far as it goes and really adds
credibility to the whole its unsoundness may con
sist not only in the nullity or even unfavourable
tendency of many of the arguments advanced but
in the suppression of all that is to be said on the
other side
there are besides serious d priori objections in
some particular cases to arguments of this nature
suppose a person enforcing some point of practical
and universal duty confessing that he had no one
powerful argument but resting it on a combination
of weak arguments we should feel the absence of
any single convincing one to be a positive objection
against him and such as to throw great discredit on
the whole not all minds are able to grasp numerous
topics at once and weigh their collective value yet
all are called to morality and it seems incredible
that popular duties can rest on so subtle a basis
nearly the same will apply to political arguments
where the primary rights and comforts or liberties
or duties of men are involved
it is chiefly in the reasonings which engage the
attentions of the studious in philosophical historical
judicial and literary questions that combination of



hypotheses

minor arguments is seen in unimpaired force paleys
horae paulina exhibits a variety of coincidences
between the epistles attributed to st paul and the
acts of the apostles such as taken separately would
have little weight but united form an unanswerable
argument for the authenticity of both and for the
reality of the facts
mr agar elliss remarks on lord clarendon is
another example of the powerful argument resulting
from a combination of small matters occasionally
also our courts of law exhibit remarkably the force
of what is called circumstantial evidence
sect vii hypotheses
in giving some account of the scholastic logic
i made mention of hypotheses in a sense different
from that in which i shall now use it i then spoke
of what we popularly term assumptions and in
mathematics sometimes postulates propositions
which are assumed or begged for a while with
the understanding that they shall be afterwards
discussed and proved more at leisure i now speak
of that which we popularly term hypotheses namely
the causes supposed invented or adopted to account
for known phenomena
i cannot introduce what i have to say better than
by an extract from a work already quoted
 it has been laid down by sir isaac newton as
the first rule of philosophizing that we are to admit
no more causes of natural things or of the phenomena
Ã¢–  prichard on a vital principle p 

hypotheses



of nature than such as are both true and sufficient to
explain their appearances this has been received as
one of the fundamental laws of reasoning by natural
philosophers and a deduction has been made from
it that whenever a philosophical theory is proposed
or an attempt made to account for particular pheno
mena it is incumbent upon us in the first place to
give some direct proof that the cause assigned is
a thing which really exists before we proceed to
enquire whether it is sufficient to explain the ap
pearances which are to be accounted for on this
ground we are forbidden to infer the existence of
any agent whatever from the circumstance that it
affords when once supposed an explanation of the
phenomena ascribed to its agency but though this
construction has been put upon newtons expressions
it was not the purpose which he had really in view 
as any body may be convinced by referring to the
remarks which in his principia lib initio follow
the passage i have just cited it must be
acknowledged by every body that a theory which
has in its favor both of the requisites above de
scribed fully and completely is entitled to the
highest regard and must be placed on a very
different ground from that of a mere hypothesis
be it ever so probable the theory of gravitation
is perhaps the best example which the whole compass
of natural philosophy affords of such a theory com
plete in every respect and strictly deserving the
title of a philosophical doctrine in that instance
the principle proposed for the explanation of pheno
mena is first ascertained beyond all doubt as a



hypotheses

matter of fact and it is afterwards shown to be
competent to the explanation of all the phenomena
ascribed to it but there are few examples of rea
soning on the laws of nature so successful and we
are often obliged to rest satisfied with theories which
cannot lay claim to so high a title p 
 different opinions have been maintained by logi
cians and writers on the inductive philosophy as to
the value of hypotheses which have but a low
degree of previous evidence and yet i think it
must be admitted by all those who will candidly
reflect on the subject that there may be cases to
which a simple hypothesis shall obtain a high degree
of assent such hypotheses when successful have
been compared to a variety of analogous things to
the key that fits and opens a lock to the clue or
solution of an enigma and to the key of a cypher
now in either of these cases Ã¢€”if the lock has been
very difficult to open very complicated in its con
struction if the riddle was such as could be ex
plained in no other way if the cypher could only be
interpreted by a single key Ã¢€”the discovery would
carry with it such a degree of evidence as to require
no additional aid
in expressing the fullest agreement with the doc
trine of this extract i will add that it appears to me
to deal too tenderly with the opposite opinion an
opinion which seems to me not only a glaring mistake
but to make it impossible to establish truths of
incalculable importance for instance how is it
ever possible to arrive at a belief in god from a
contemplation of nature if i must jirst prove that

hypotheses



gods and divine agency do exist before it is allowed
me to adduce divine agency as a cause of what i
see such a dogma shuts the door entirely on all
theology and forbids us to learn of the existence
of any agents except those whose existence is pal
pable to the senses it was very natural for bacon
and newton after philosophy had been so spoiled by
introducing occult causes plastic virtue celestial
spirit and suchlike words without meaning to be
very jealous and perhaps overjealous on this head
but even in contending against such fictions it was
not needed to run to the opposite extreme of scepti
cism
but if i mistake not those who maintain the
doctrine in question must exceedingly overrate the
number of agents of whose existence we have or
can have what they call direct evidence it is but
an analogical evidence that we possess concerning ten
thousand things the existence of which we do not
doubt analogy leads us to refer works that look
like what we know to be the works of man to human
operation english sailors who find rude pottery
and plumes of birds made up into a headdress in
an unknown island consider them to be the work
of some inhabitants of whose existence hitherto they
have had no direct evidence yet this analogy so
satisfies the mind that perhaps we quote it as direct
evidence but if a savage were to find a watch still
going it would seem so to surpass the productions of
man that he probably would think it the work of a
god just so do we impute to divine agency the
origination of species and for the very same reason
h



hypotheses

neither argument is to be impugned on the ground
that we have no direct evidence of such agency 
but the former is faulty in concluding too hastily
that the work transcended the powers of known
agents and till this hypothesis fails we have no
business to have recourse to unknown ones
again it is analogy which suggests that light is a
pulsation of something similar to that which we see
in water nor can it be said that we have any direct
evidence of the existence of ether but he would
be a pertinacious antagonist of the vibratory system
who should maintain that no amount of argument
from the agreement of the hypothesis with the various
and complicated phenomena would suffice to establish
the existence of the ether
a hypothesis must be such as when granted
suffices to account for the phenomena and if pos
sible it must be the only conceivable hypothesis that
will account for them
first the hypothesis must be such as when
granted will suffice to account for the phenomenon
this implies some acquaintance with the laws of
causation it may in an extended sense be called a
known law of causation that human intellect and
power is equal to build cities and pyramids sink
moles and breakwaters shut out the sea by dams
yet if a work exceed a certain magnitude we reject
the hypothesis of its being human because human
power appears inadequate as to degree
the historian herodotus delivers four opinions
concerning the rise of the nile in summer the first
that it is caused by the summer winds which hinder

hypotheses



the nile from entering the sea this he refutes by
alleging that they do not always blow yet the nile
always overflows moreover that other rivers having
a like direction with the nile and smaller in volume
of water do not overflow secondly it was alleged
as the cause that the nile is a part of ocean who
flows round all the earth he replies that such
obscurity cannot be brought to the test of truth or
falsehood and he knows nothing of river ocean
except in homers poetry thirdly the melting of
snows in ethiopia our author denies that there is
any snow in so hot a country where says he there
is not even rain fourthly comes his own hypothesis
that the sun is carried far south in winter by the
north winds and in consequence the springs of the
nile are burned up by that god which in summer
does not happen it will be observed that the first
hypothesis is rejected as inadequate in degree and
as known sometimes not to exist in fact the third
as never existing the second because there is no
known parallel to the supposed law of causation his
own account of the matter professes to adopt a known
fact perfectly as uniform in its occurrence as the
phenomenon to be accounted for and b known
laws of causation to show that it is adequate to the
result it will however be observed that he does
not so much account for the niles overflowing in
summer as for its not overflowing in winter
if certain shells and petrified animals be discovered
and a hypothesis be proposed that a certain plastic
power of the earth produced them we hesitate
about this because we have considerable ground for
h



hypotheses

disbelieving the alleged power to have ever existed
the whole presumption lies the other way for
though we have much acquaintance with the earth
we have never detected her in the act of exerting such
plastic power in this and in other hypothetic
agencies as vital principle nervous fluid electric
power immaterial principle we have so vague an
idea what is the thing intended or what powers it is
capable of exerting that it appears like a barren
name which can do every thing or nothing it
therefore only serves to disguise our ignorance
secondly the hypothesis must if possible be
exclusive of other hypotheses it is clear that our
argument becomes in this case purely syllogistic
for we first show that the present phenomenon may
have been caused by our hypothesis next that it
cannot have been caused by any thing else unless
then it is to be believed entirely without a cause the
hypothesis is demonstratively established
it is but rarely that we can thus exhaust the num
ber of hypotheses so as to produce absolute demon
stration but we suffice ourselves with refuting those
which men of sound mind and acquainted with the
subject are likely to adduce again it constantly
happens that objections lie against all the hypotheses
that present themselves but if there is strong reason
for thinking that one or other must be true it
becomes a question of comparison viz which hypo an aristotelian might refer the argument to the head of
disjunctive hypothetical thus the cause sought for must be
either a b or c but we can prove that it is not b nor c
therefore it is a

hylotheses



thesis has fewest or weakest objections but two
hypotheses inconsistent with each other each ade
quate to the result and otherwise apparently unob
jectionable destroy each others force the mind
being left in the same uncertainty as though each
were objectionable until something can turn the
scale to illustrate it familiarly when two keys
open one lock we do not know which is the true 
and a suspicion will arise that numerous other keys
may open it equally well
if however it can be shown that one or other of
the contending hypotheses must needs be true the
question is most usefully narrowed where it is
otherwise the most specious systems are frequently
overturned by farther discovery
if a hypothesis solves a great many phenomena
and leaves only the more tangled and obscure or
subordinate ones unsolved there is a high pre
sumption in its favor so long as we can refer the
difficulties to our own ignorance or mistakes but
when our knowledge becomes more distinct and
searching this apology is not allowed astronomical
variations that in the days of kepler would have
been thought no objection to the doctrine of gravi
tation it is remarked by sir j herschel would
now be sufficient to overturn that doctrine if they
could not be solved by it on the contrary as they
can it is a vast confirmation to us since the theory
has stood the trial
if a hypothesis be framed in order to embrace
several phenomena and is afterwards found to ac
count for other phenomena likewise which were



hypotheses

previously unknown this is justly considered a high
confirmation because the chances against such a
coincidence seem very great if it be merely acci
dental yet we have remarkable illustrations how
near error may come to truth and how plausible its
face the corpuscular and the vibratory theories
of light cannot both be true yet both were invented
with reference to the primary phenomena of reflected
and refracted light and both have proved capable
with certain modification of explaining other most
remarkable phenomena since discovered
human life is full of cases admitting double solu
tions and no fallacy is more common than that of
supposing a hypothesis true because much can be
said in its favor many are so affected by the
arguments which can get a first hearing that they
are unable to give attention to the claims of the
opposite side but whenever two hypotheses fight
hard and long together the suspicion must be
admitted that neither is strictly true but something
intermediate to both embracing that by which each
is strong and divested of its weaknesses
it excites a just suspicion that something is wrong
when we find the same or similar phenomena ac
counted for at different times by different hypotheses
even though the hypotheses should seem separately
viewed to be adequate a poor patient in con
sumption is said to show wonderful ingenuity to the
very last in assigning causes for getting a little worse

usually cold or he ate something wrong the
bystander sees that so uniform a result does not
proceed from causes so varying so in national
distresses it is a war a bad harvest a foolish min
istry a particular monopoly and other passing
things on which the grinding habitual want of the
poor is laid in successive years when more probably
the cause is deeper seated in bad moral character
bad or unjust institutions and oppressive laws
necessary cautions or rules respecting the adop
tion of hypotheses are the following not to
multiply them needlessly for this would give so
much scope to mere fancy that no knowledge would
be attainable if on entering my room i find three
chairs out of place one agent is sufficient to have
done this and on the face of the matter it would be
unreasonable to suppose three but if they be placed
as if three persons had been sitting together the
case is altered for i have to choose between these
two hypotheses either three persons have been
really thus sitting together else some one has
placed them accidentally or purposely so as to give
this appearance if i cannot conjecture any motive
for doing it and if the phenomenon seem too formal
to be the result of accident the latter hypothesis is
improbable while if it is notorious that as many as
three persons may readily have had access to the
room as readily as one no objection lies against the
former hypothesis
if my desk were broken open and three pieces of
money were taken out it would not occur to me to
suppose that three different persons had taken them

hypotheses
for one could do it quite as well else there would
be no end to the multiplication of supposed agents
one might have brought a chisel a second a hammer
a third have broken it open three more may have
taken the money and so forth a second rule
might be laid down which is virtually included in
the first that an agent previously admitted to exist
is to be preferred in a hypothesis caeteris paribus
over another not yet thus admitted
if i must
suppose one person at least to have had access to
my desk and break it open i need not invent three
more to take the money thus we include in our
caution all that bacon or newton could justly desire
in rejecting mere hypothetical existences so long as
they can be dispensed with
the strong repugnance of the whole baconian
school to this particular error is not unjust nor un
called for as it is a most fruitful source of folly
and superstition if a persons toe is pinched by his
shoe he may impute it to the queen of the fairies
pricking him and if his milk boils over some other
mischievous imp has poured it away polytheism
generally points to the same origin each pecu
liarity of nature the greeks attributed to a different
celestial agent when one was sufficient the ori
entals equally had their genii presiding over different
departments of nature
such reasoning was not
faulty on the bare ground that hypothetical beings
ought not to be introduced at all but that many
ought not to be introduced where one sufficed nor
even one if the agents previously ascertained to
exist suffice it has been observed that if a single

hypotheses



instance could be produced of a race of horses having
degenerated into asses this would convince all the
world that asses universally are nothing but degene
rate horses the reasoning would be as follows
there are two hypotheses that the creator origi
nally established two separate species horse and
ass or that he created one species horse capable
of degenerating into ass either of which hypo
theses suffices to account for the existence of asses
but since we are forced at any rate to admit the
latter hypothesis in accordance with our supposed
fact we dispense with the former as needless
so again it is unreasonable to invent a plastic
virtue in the earth for producing shells such
 virtue having no prior evidence when there is
already a known cause daily witnessed that pro
duces them viz the birth and growth of animals
that live in them if animal shells were wholly
unknown the hypothesis would not be in itself
absurd but the process of shell making or cochlization might be believed analogous to crystalliza
tion c but after all allowances it is difficult to
repress amazement that philosophers should for ages
have fancied that heated slime could generate ani
mals it is to be supposed that they reasoned thus 
first they too hastily believed the alleged fact that
insects are produced by carrion and by the slime of
the nile next having as they thought learned that
such a slime had a vivifying power as regards insects
it seemed rational to suppose that it might also
produce marine animals or at least abortive attempts
in the way of shells and skeletons heathens

hypotheses

carried it farther generally believing that each
nation of men sprang out of the soil in which they
were indigenous
similar superstitions attach themselves even to the
productions of man the greeks believed that
mercury made the harp apollo the bow ceres
the plough and vulcan all metal instruments admi
ration poetry and superstition combining to make
them pronounce such works divine in extenuation
we may say that they already believed the existence
of these deities and their occasional kindnesses to
individuals but even among ourselves we may see
a tendency to refer to supernatural operations things
which manifestly fall within the known powers of
man and it needs much soundness of mind to hold
a due balance in this matter
but it may be asked when we fully believe
already in the existence power and presence of a
divine being why should we deliberately set him
aside as a physical agent why is it not as allowable
a hypothesis that god did this or that as
 man did it and the question deserves a reply
there is a theological sense and an important
sense in which he is the doer of every thing as
having given to all things the power which they
possess while foreseeing all the effects with this
subject we are not now concerned but when it has
been found to so large an extent in fact to the full
extent of observation that matter is regulated by
uniform laws which give no indications of the actings
of will analogous to our own we cannot suppose him
in particular instances to interpose as a direct agent

hypotheses



like ourselves without being forced to speculate on
his purposes in so doing this may at first sight
appear presumptuous but it is inevitable unless we
will annihilate all knowledge soever by referring
every thing to his absolute and inscrutable choice in
each particular case and this in a philosophic
that is in a consistent mind would soon come back
to atheism by a denial of his having any purposes or
personality and merging him in the principle that
actuates matter so soon as it appears that we can
weigh and measure and predict his doings and the
only mode of saving religion is then by a suppres
sion of all close thinking it being therefore
inevitable to canvass his possible purposes for work
ing a miracle we are constrained to set aside nearly
all the cases which come under science at all as
being such as he would not have interfered in
doubtless it was in his power to create by a word
the crust of the earth as it now is with shells and
bones and variously disposed strata having all the
appearance of being brought about by the action of
water fire and chemical combinations on substances
variously brought together but as we feel unable
to assign any purposes in this except to puzzle
geologists and this is utterly unworthy of him all
such notions are put aside as rather impious than
pious in every department of natural science the
same thing perpetually recurs so soon as the exist
ence of the divine being is granted some reason
must be given why he is excluded from our hypo
theses and this always turns upon our apprehension
of his moral character if to almighty power were



hypotheses

joined the caprice of a fairy or evil passions of a
genius it would not be absurd to impute to such a
being the most fantastic or mischievous miracles
at the same time the above may account for the
fact that natural philosophy and all close reasoning is
apt to bear an irreligious aspect to those who view it
superficially for while we appear often to admit
chance as a cause of things we seem to grant to the
divinity only an honorary existence such as epicurus
gave his gods living in blessed tranquillity but too
shadowy to stir bulky matter it also appears like
 the spirit of unbelief to strain every nerve to
account for facts in an ordinary way before we will
have recourse to an extraordinary hypothesis yet
without this caution we are presently overrun with
false miracles legends and ghosts and it cannot be
doubted that the too large credulity of the early
christian church in these things due partly to the
low state of science partly to the breaking down of
the improbability of miracles by their comparative
frequency in the apostolic age materially contributed
to the general subsequent darkness
 a third rule for hypotheses often given is again
only a modification of the former that the simplest
hypothesis ceteris paribus is to be preferred for
by the simplest we generally mean that which has
fewest independent particulars and each of these
particulars might be called a separate hypothesis
this may be illustrated by the copernican theory
the phenomenon to be accounted for is the revolu
tion of the stars in twentyfour hours and if our
attention be confined to this single fact each hypo

hypotheses



thesis equally well solves it whether the stars are at rest
and the earth revolves or the earth is at rest and the
stars revolve but the revolution of each separate star
is to be looked on as a separate hypothesis until it be
shown that one cannot revolve without the other now
if there were only stars we are making hy
potheses to account for the phenomenon and are leav
ing unaccounted for what is most surprising at all the
precise coincidence of the period of their revolution
this would be so monstrous that all who supported
the immoveability of the earth were driven to regard
the stars as studs fastened within the solid surface
of the heavens there are thus two points in the
hypothesis the existence of such sphere and its
revolution while the copernican theory needed but
one concession the revolution of the earth the
example shows that the three rules which we have
given merge in one another for we might object to
the crystal sphere that its existence being as yet
hypothetical it must not be needlessly introduced
in some cases it is hard to decide wherein consists
simplicity of a hypothesis because of our ignorance
how far the particulars that seem to be independent
are really connected but when certain causes are
proved to exist and it is shown what their action
ought to be and next phenomena are pointed out
exactly agreeing hereto no conceivable complexity
is an objection but rather the contrary for the
existence and action of the causes is not the hypo
thesis but the circumstance that a known pheno
menon is due to those known causes thus if any
one demonstrate that the earths revolution an un



hypotheses

doubted fact ought to diminish gravity at the
equator and the protuberance of the equatorial
matter another ascertained fact ought to do the
same it is not regarded as a disadvantageous com
plexity to the hypothesis that these two causes
conspire to make a pendulum beat slower at the
equator even if we have not learned that the two
causes may be resolved into one and for this obvious
reason that so far from being anxious to get rid of
one of the causes as in the case of hypothetic
existences we should found an objection against the
theory if the effects of both causes did not appear
in mathematical reasonings the argument from
simplicity often takes this shape that in assuming
a hypothetic law we introduce the fewest number of
 arbitrary constants which the phenomena will
allow thus no one who could account for the
resistance of fluids by assuming it to be equal to au
v being the velocity would think of assuming it
 aÃ¢lu even if the latter equally well agreed with
the truth it would however stand over for farther
inquiry till one or other should be disprovedeven in these exact sciences it is difficult to settle
what we mean by simplicity perhaps a mathe
matician might think auu a simpler law then cue
though it has one more arbitrary constant the
chief use of these remarks is to point out the advisableness of referring the argument from simplicity
to one of the two preceding heads to which i be
lieve it can always be reduced when it has real weight
 a fourth rule may seem needless that a
hypothesis must not reproduce difficulties equal to

those for which it is invented to account as a type
of such useless inventions we may refer to the sage
story of the hindoos that the earth rests on the
back of an elephant and the elephant on the back of
a tortoise alike unsatisfactory are the causes them
selves unaccounted for which the historian gibbon
assigns for the spread of christianity among which
we find him give a prominent place to the liberal
zeal of the christians contrasted with the narrow
ness of the jews their abhorrence of idolatry their
extraordinary moral virtues their deadness to the
business and pleasures of the world and the directing
of all their ambition and patriotism into the channel
of the church the important difference between
the english and the hindoo reasoner is that the
elephant and tortoise are imaginary while the causes
alleged by gibbon are real facts yet as facts they
remain as extraordinary and unprecedented as the
phenomenon under discussion

spfcfjc information
thus far we have been engaged with the laws of
reasoning by which the mind passes from one judg
ment to another from that which is better known
to that which is less known we are now better
prepared to inquire how the first truths are learned
from which we pass to others it might seem that it
would have been more orderly to treat this question
first as the natural arrangement of terms proposi
tions syllogisms might seem to dictate but as we



specific information

proceed it will appear how we have been forced to
deviate from that order
of truths which we receive as the foundations of
reasoning and not as the result of reasoning there
are two classes the former are such as are called
merely verbal which assert nothing about facts
except so far as the meaning attached to words is a
fact these are ascertained to be true or agreeable
to themselves by inspecting the meaning of the
words or the definitions but real truths are not
merely agreeable to themselves but agreeable to
matter of fact and must therefore be ascertained by
means of those instruments by which the mind
becomes acquainted with that which is exterior to
itself viz by the senses
it will however be convenient to take a larger
range than this expression might imply so as to
include not only the things testified by our own
naked senses but all truths which we receive by
specific information if otherwise we get too much
off the ground of logic on to that of physiology
for our present purpose it seems convenient to in
stitute various classes of informants on whose testi
mony we believe without reasoning that is to say
we may reason concerning their veracity and trust
worthiness but this being established we receive
their information as a matter of fact such an in if by the word intuition is understood what its derivation
suggests inspection or the fixing of the mind on the words
then verbal truths may be said to be known by intuition
but i prefer avoiding this word because it has received a vague
and rather mystical sense

specific information



formant is a telescope opportunities in plenty occur
for trying with near or known objects whether it tells
truth but its character being once established we
believe its information even where we cannot readily
check it nay we employ it to test the veracity of
another instrument hitherto unproved the same
will apply to all philosophical instruments
a
stethoscope a chronometer a thermometer has
its character for veracity and the experimentalist
always anxiously inquires within what limits he may
trust its information
we may regard the eye as an informant in the
very same sense as a telescope from the dawn of
existence we learn to test and check the veracity of
this sense by help of touch and afterwards the
separate senses check each other just as in the
case supposed of two travellers giving a like report
of innumerable details in a foreign country in which
both would be believed because they could not have
accidentally hit on the same tale provided only that
we could be secure against any collusion or drawing
from the same source so is it with the sight and
touch or with the sight hearing and touch by
unnumbered trials during every waking hour of life
we gain a most elevated opinion of the veracity of
these three informants so that we unscrupulously
believe any one of them singly no one doubts
whether there be moon and stars in the sky though
we can neither hear nor touch them nor feel any
thing from their presence it is enough that we see
them nor do we desire confirmation of this testi
mony just so when the astronomer sees by his



slecific information

telescope satellites revolving round jupiter he be
lieves the fact as unhesitatingly as the vulgar believe
what is seen by the naked eye indeed a child will
learn by a very little experience in the use of a
magnifying lens that it distorts an image seen
through its edges or obliquely but that he may
put full confidence in its information when used to
advantage no one will say that credit is given to
such instruments without reason nor yet does it
seem possible to assign a reason other than the enor
mous improbability that they should agree with the
senses and with each other in all the cases tested
and then prove fallacious when we most wish their
help and this is the identical argument for the
veracity of the senses themselves
the difference of the vulgar and the philosophic
dependence on any such informants consists in the
greater care with which the philosopher discriminates
the limits within which they are trustworthy and
the effect of unusual circumstances in embarassing and
deceiving them hence without approaching the
absurdity of universal scepticism he is led to reject
and disbelieve the testimony of sense in particular
cases in this matter some ancient sects ranged them
selves under childish extremes while the platonics
undervalued the truth of the senses and some
branches of them went into the mysticism of an
interior world with a tendency to deny the sensible
world the epicureans in a contrary zeal to uphold
the veracity of the senses ridiculously maintained
that the sun is no larger than it looks words to
which it seems impossible to affix any sense unless

virgils poetry help us to some idea who says that
polyphemuss eye was as large as an argive shield
or the lamp of phwbus a true philosophy teaches
us great reliance in our senses for common purposes
and under common circumstances while it also in
structively shows numberless cases where they cannot
be trusted
physiology moreover points out that their appa
rent want of veracity is to be imputed to our mis
interpretation of them their indications are faithful
in a healthy state but we commit what would be
called by an astronomer errors of reading off
when the shadow is thrown truly on the dial we
note its place inaccurately all this is undeniably
true it is notorious that we see distance not by
direct information of the eye but by a process of
reasoning upon the facts furnished to us by the eye 
aud when we misjudge the distance it is not pro
perly the eye which has deceived us it is the mind
which argued erroneously we are apt to suppose
that our senses give us information of temperature
and of motion but it can be proved that they only
tell us of the changes of temperature of the more or
less rapid accession and loss of heat and of relative not
absolute motion under numerous circumstances yet
i apprehend interesting as this is to the physiologist
it is a difference of no importance to the logician
except where we are able to disentangle the fact
furnished by the eye from the reasoning superadded
by the mind we are forced to regard the last result
as furnished immediately by the eye if a witness



specific information

were to depose as a matter of fact that a person
was within arms length of him when something
happened it would be most unreasonable to expect
him to discriminate that which he really saw from
what he inferred he says and thinks that his eyes
told him how far off the person was and probably
this is all that he knows about it
this leads to remark that memory is an informant
equally important with any sense and is verified in
a similar manner a boy hides something in a secret
place and remembers that he so hid it on going
afterwards to look for it he finds it safe this is a
check and test that his memory was a veracious
informant by much similar experience most per
sons learn what measure of credit is to be given to
their own memory and though the limits are very
vague within which they will trust it in clear cases
a man identifies his memory with his senses do
you want to persuade me out of my senses is the
indignant exclamation of one whose memory others
are trying to overwhelm by contrary evidence
just as we refer a general result to the testimony
of the eye mixing its perceptions with the inferences
of the mind so do we in the case of memory a
general impression is left we know the substance of
what was said while perhaps unable to depose a word
accurately the mind has perhaps translated the
speech and several successive acts of memory have
taken place in consequence the difference between
man and man as to accuracy of memory is immense
vastly surpassing any difference as to the senses

specific information



indeed some regular storytellers are said to go on
gradually exaggerating till they believe half of their
own lie
if we have written down a transaction the case
becomes a little more complicated the original
witness of the senses is then passed on as it were
second hand and memory is no longer required to
depose what took place but negatively that it does
not remember any thing to the contrary and posi
tively that we wrote it ourselves and if memory
be here uncertain it is checked by examination of
the handwriting and perhaps the very paper and
ink confirms it again memory has to testify the
negative fact that we never wrote down lies it is
a remarkable phenomenon with what strength all
men can remember negations of this kind when they
remember nothing positive
the testimony of our fellowmen may logically be
classed as coordinate with the testimony of a tele
scope which again is coordinate with that of the
senses we have to prove the veracity of all alike
and having proved their character in the general on
the credit of this we believe particular statements which
we have no opportunity of testing of course the
mode of testing their veracity is widely different and
on this i shall have more to say
it is not the sensations only of others which we
thus receive by transmission the judgments also of
men in their own science are often received as facts of
evidence a sailor tells us that a squall is rising or
that a certain ship is a pirate a physician pronounces
that a patient will recover a counsellor that a cause

will not stand in the courts even when general
truths are involved as well as special auguries they
are allowed to stand on the credit of the witness in
defect of better means of judging and when we have
no time or skill or means to enter on the enquiry
independently but if the details can be obtained
and laid open to inspection and leisurely criticism
it of course conduces to accuracy
it is almost needless to add that our conviction of
the facts testified by specific information depends
on the confidence of the allegation as well as on the
character for veracity which we attribute to the
informant but this is one of the cases in which
combined arguments are so powerful though the
ears might be halfstunned by noises and the eyes
dazzled by cross lights let us be ever so conscious
that either may deceive us yet while they agree in
the same conclusion we believe them both

argument from authority
it is right to discriminate between the argument
from authority and the argument of testimony
which are sometimes closely allied
the evidence of a surgeon or physician on a
matter falling within their science is received by
a jury just as any other fact from an ordinary
witness it is supposed that their depositions would
be confirmed by the rest of the faculty could these
have had the same opportunities of observing they

are looked on as men who have another sense or
instrument we hear their statements as sailors hear
the announcements of their fellow who has climbed
to the masthead to look out or as blind men receive
the testimony of one who has sight so long as it is
apprehended that they do but depose to that which
is notoriously within the compass of the science to
decide their evidence stands on the same footing as
the evidence of other mens senses
if the evidence given rest on the extraordinary
talent of the individual but is such as the rest of his
own faculty could not confirm we no longer count it
evidence to fact but a matter of opinion while any
body of scientific men are unanimous in their judg
ments provided that they be not directly opposed to
common sense and knowledge the rest of the world
pays the like deference to them as the blind to those
who can see and it seems to be hopeless and foolish
to contend against them but when this unanimity
does not exist or when two men of like science are
at variance the less experienced of the two cannot
receive his abler brothers decision as a matter of fact
and of evidence but he may bow to it as a matter of
authority
a person unversed in philosophic observations and
experiments might say that he believed the doctrine
of gravitation on the testimony of astronomers and
he received the corpuscular theory of light on the
authority of newton in such language it is im
plied that the former doctrine stands on so firm
a basis that the ordinary human faculties going
through the common course of instruction gain an



argument from authority

eye for the discernment of it and give a uniform
witness to it the latter theory is represented as
resting not on the common sense of mankind but on
the superiority of one remarkable man
the difference between the two is immense we
have the most unhesitating trust in the average good
sense and soundness of mind of men taken as it were
at random out of the massÃ¢€”insomuch that it would
seem wise to disbelieve the testimony of our own
senses in supposable cases where the combined
testimony of others opposed but causes innume
rable and unintelligible daily arise to lead the ablest
men astray in individual cases even where the
natural sciences are concerned the argument from
authority is no doubt in particular schools greatly
abused the followers of a great man are so en
slaved to their masters peculiarities that they love
his errors as much as his points of excellence yet
in modern times this seldom outlasts one generation
the enormous accumulation of facts witnesses that
cannot be bribed to speak nor to be silent form
a barrier which enthusiam cannot penetrate
in moral political religious tenets it is unhappily
far otherwise these are subjects on which it is the
duty of every man to hold not opinions merely but
principles and on which it were easy but is unlawful
to surrender responsibility to a set of literati while
all do to a certain extent at least in theory agree on
these points yet there is no school so agreeing with
itself as to be able to set forth a grammar and elements
of the subject we cannot very decidedly say what
is learned from what even when we agree as to the

argument fitom authority



truth much less is it possible to pretend to put
together our views into such a systematic shape as
shall command conviction of others hence it is
possible for mischievous and absurd error to run to
great lengths anc abide a long time without any
efficient confutation i mean without that which has
any force of confutation towards those who need it
this is a state of things in which it seems a
balance of difficulty whether to lean much or little
on authority to reject it looks like trusting too
much to self to adopt it is trusting to chance if
not to self for what authority are we to follow 
if we are guided by our birthplace and suchlike
circumstances it is giving the matter as it were to
chance and it were an abomination to say that
every man ought to bow to the idol whom his sect
shall have been used to worship if we try to select
for ourselves the question recurs whether this is not
trusting self as much as if we went without such
authority doubtless it is often easier to know a
good man from a bad one than to discriminate true
opinions from false and in religious and moral
truth this goes a great way but on the other
hand there are few who have the opportunity of
acquaintance with men of opposite ways of thinking 
so as to judge well on this head and the impression
is apt to be that those of our party are generally
very good and the bad are an exception but those
of the other party are mostly bad and the good are
the exception thus in the vast majority of in
stances mere chance and locality determine what
authority a man shall follow and perhaps nothing so
r



argument from authority

perpetuates error and bigotry with so much certain
mischief and so little advantage as this leaning on
authority for it is the peculiarities of strongminded men which most impress themselves on their
disciples and their peculiarities are very often their
defects neither is the case much mended when the
appeal is made to the wisdom not of an individual
but of a school so long as rival schools exist for
almost every school was originally founded by very
few individuals whose energies or whose authority
has stamped on it ever after the impress of their
minds
the unfair and invidious use made in controversy
of the argument from authority is sufficiently de
noted by the name which the schoolmen have be
stowed on it argument addressed to bashfulness
the object of using it was not to convince but to
stop an opponents mouth if he were bashful
enough to quail before the name of aristotle or
augustin or again to hold him up to odium if he
were impudent enough to reject their authority
assuredly it is the ordained system of this world
that while the faculties are immature youth should
look up to its elders so that in a certain sense the
deference to authority might be called a part of
nature but this rather operates in not attempting
to form opinions than in adopting opinions if a
father happens to be a strong whig it would be
ridiculous to tell his young son that in deference
to authority he must hold whig principles too
common sense would rather say that while he is
young he must not wish to hold any principles at

argument ijiom authority



all and when he grows older if he is called to hold
some he must ask information from all sides
it is observed by bacon that his system of induc
tion in a manner equalizes intellects an ordinary
mind led on step by step as facts point can reach
securely and at an early age eminences of knowledge
to which the highest intellects of former times could
not soar had he foreseen that newton would
follow him he probably would have used language
less strong but though it by no means equalizes
intellects it certainly diminishes the occasions and
pretence of appealing to authority as indeed does
the art of writing where this art is unknown
personal experience is almost alone available and is
the peculiar prerogative of years in halfcivilized
life old men have a monopoly of wisdom a coun
sellor and an aged man are synonymous terms in
such a state bare authority aiirb pÃ¢ is of course
more cogent than when the experience of past ages
becomes available to the present and when years
are necessary only to let the mind ripen and not also
for a knowledge of facts there will always be abun
dant reasons for treating with respect the judgments
of those older than ourselves but when it is noto
rious that there are old men on all sides of various
questions it is fighting against nature and truth to
press the topic of authority as though it could be
adapted to convince in defect of all other means of
judgment authority will establish a strong pre
sumption and when we are coming to an opposite re
sult it inculcates caution it enjoins a reconsideration
of the argument but after this it has done its office
i 



argument from authority

the disputatious use made of it to silence one
whom it cannot convince is the more unjustifiable
because in most cases where it is so employed the
means are wanting for testing the wisdom of him
to whom it appeals in the arts and sciences wisdom
is not very hard to test all know that cook was a
great navigator and haller a great physiologist but
whether a particular statesman or a particular divine
possessed wisdom proportional to his fame is often
quite uncertain
a reader of aristotle is at first surprised at the
stress which he lays on the authority of lawgivers
probably this was occasioned by the peculiar circum
stances under which many codes of laws were be
lieved to have been received in greece in modern
europe the law is generally the work of the stronger
party under circumstances which would make it
an infatuation to appeal to legislation as the acme
of human wisdom but the greek legislators such
as lycurgus epimenides solon pythagoras were
very generally private citizens who were invited
to settle public affairs by a belief of their wisdom 
and in most cases their decisions proved highly
satisfactory so as to remain valid by the sanction
of public opinion it is therefore probable that
whatever principles all these legislators held in com
mon aristotle considered to be not only the fruit of
the collective wisdom of philosophic minds but also
an expression of the general good sense of the nation
of which they were the organs

veracity of informants



sect ix
veracity of informants
there are two general topics for believing the
deposition of an informant because he or it
has hitherto under like circumstances told truth 
 because those who are most like him do generally
under such circumstances tell truth
the former topic would cceteris paribus be the
stronger and in regard to instruments of human
production is vastly so thus if a sea captain is
testing his longitude with two chronometers the
one is new but was made by earnshaw or ramsden 
the other has been tried before and proved good he
would certainly rather believe the latter than the
former in spite of the topic that most of earnshaws are good in fact no one would count much
on an unproved instrument be the maker who he might
so among men the word of an englishman would
gain more credit than that of a hindoo if both alike
were unknown but if the veracity of the hindoo
had been often proved while no testimony could be
brought of the past veracity of the englishman the
hindoo would be believed in preference
but it is possible that the two instruments whose
information is put in contrast may be differently cir
cumstanced that which has the higher character may
be more exposed to perturbing causes heat wet agi
tation c and on this account may be the less
believed unless it has previously been exposed to
similar trials and proved true in spite of them so



veracity of informants

also in comparing the evidence of human witnesses
one may be under temptations to falsehood which
the other is not under as when a man of previous
good character is accused of a crime his denial adds
little to our confidence that he did not commit it
if his character does not of itself persuade us that he
is innocent neither does his denial
let us see how multiplied testimony affects a case
the master of a ship finds his best chronometer
deviate considerably from three inferior ones which
three nearly agree with each other the range of their
disagreement being considerably less than the devia
tion of the other from their mean time he has no
means of accounting for their errors which of them
will he believe i apprehend he will reason thus
whatever cause as heat or agitation should have
affected one of the three would probably affect the
other two and in the same way hence their agree
ment is no stronger argument than the testimony of
one and the best instrument is to be believed in
preference to the united testimony of the three if
however he can in part account for their errors the
case is altered suppose they have been all exposed
to increased heat and the three worse instruments are
slower than the other he may justly attribute the
slackening to the heat and suppose the best instru
ment by the superiority of its construction to have
resisted the perturbing cause but if the best instru
ment happened to be slowest of all he would pro
bably suppose some accidental cause to have deranged
it and would now believe the three in preference

veracity of informants



for if accidental causes had deranged the three and
not one uniformly acting cause he could not expect
so near agreement between them
apply this to human evidence the testimony of
one intelligent witness may outweigh that of three or
of three hundred in cases where it is easy to suppose
a common cause to bias all of these last where there
is room for this to act the weight of testimony is not
increased by multiplying witnesses but where no
room for the supposition can be found then the
weight of their testimony is increased with their
number according to the doctrine of combined
chances
thus far we have shown the analogy that subsists
between trusting to the indications of an instrument
and trusting to a mans testimony but of course
each investigation soon takes a separate path the
philosopher or mechanic needs his own peculiar art
to help in judging of the goodness of a telescope or a
watch and a knowledge of human nature is requi
site for judging of human evidence thus logic
may seem to borrow a chapter from ethics but the
knowledge wanting is not of a scientific kind and in
fact details are needing that no system of morals
could supply thus the man who would form a
useful member of an english jury might turn out
a great blunderer in judging of hindoo evidence
i can only attempt a slight sketch of the topics
which force themselves on our consideration in
approaching the subject of human evidence we
may divide the case threefold according as the wit



veracity of informants

nesses have a bad character a good character or no
character at all
Ã¢– i it is an old error in england to suppose that
evidence ought not even to be taken from one who
bears a bad character for veracity this is due
chiefly to old custom and to mistaken religion one
would wish it were an equally respectable cause
which so long led to the rejection of the evidence of
slaves in the english colonies 
but a skilful use may be made of the worst evi
dence with proper pains indications of truth may
frequently be attained from two sources the
manner the matter of the evidence
first the manner none know so well as bar
risters the value of a cross examination when prac
tised not so as to bully the witness but to seek to
elicit truth a judicious observer detects numberless
marks of simple honesty or of fraud in the tones
gestures freedom of narration and of reply the
very blunders of an honest witness under perplexing
questions if they betray no substantial error will
add to the conviction of his veracity by showing
that he is not artful enough to preserve studied
consistency contrariwise inconsistencies may ap
pear that indicate forgery a mans belief in his
own story is often denoted by the emotion accom
panying it if it be a matter personally and deeply
interesting and the same even will apply to written
documents i need not add that few can with
advantage thus examine any but their fellowcountrymen or persons with whom they are become as

veracity of informants



it were naturalized thus also an inexperienced
reader might mistake the studied artifice of a rhe
torical writer for the overflowings of real feeling
next the matter however ignorant credulous
inaccurate or malicious witnesses may be the matter
testified may be such as to convince us or make it
highly probable that they speak truth Ã¢° it may
be a thing about which they could not have been
deceived if it happened in their own family or
house or beneath their own eyes if it must have been
such as forcibly to impress the mind it might then be
imputed to wilful lying but not to carelessness
Ã¢° perhaps they could not have forged the thing if
ever so disposed as a for want of knowledge if
their story was false thus herodotus alleges that the
phenicians deserved no credit who said that in sailing
down the red sea to go round africa they at last
had the sun to their north we for this very rea
son believe that they went if not round africa yet
deep within the tropics again pytheas professed
to have explored the northern shores of britain and
found the island to be longer from north to south
than from east to west strabo explodes the whole
voyage as chimerical and rebukes this idea but
nothing goes farther with us to gain belief for him
 sometimes we judge that they could not have
forged if there are many witnesses who seem to
have had no opportunity of collusion or who seem
to be too many and too separated to conspire or
y while all other sort of forgery is impossible we
may find direct proofs that there has been no con
spiracy this is furnished by their discrepancies 
i



veracity of informants

for if these be on the face of the narrative such
would have been avoided by any who wished to
pass off an untrue tale as true and if they are only
superficial they need not impair the correctness of
other points if many of the discrepancies disappear
on closer examination this is a yet more decisive
mark of truthÃ¢€”yet in all these arguments we need
to consider the possibility of a common source
whence might be drawn that which several informants
have in common in which case if they have no
other known sources of knowledge their authority
is no more than its authority by way of illustra
tion we may quote national traditions legends my
thological tales the discrepancies generally prove
that there is no intended collusion the agreements
prove a common origin but not necessarily that that
common origin is truth of fact sometimes the basis
is truth sometimes it is the fancy of an old poet
and the character is but imaginary else we must
believe endless tales about the gods and heroes of
greece but Ã¢° the matter attested is sometimes
such as the witnesses would not have forged if they
could either a because it was too refined and too
difficult for others to see thus paley lays stress on
those coincidences between the epistles of st paul
and the acts of the apostles which are not found
without close attention and which not one reader
in a thousand perhaps no reader before paley him
self discovered such coincidences it is not worth
while to forge j because there is no conceivable
end to be gained thus niebuhr while generally
distrusting livy puts great confidence in such sen

veracity of informants



tences as these this year a dictator was created
to drive a nail into the temple Ã¢€” under these
consuls fidense was invested crustumeria was taken
praeneste revolted from the latins to the romans
for the author could not here have been led away
by rhetoric party spirit or other causes which bias
him and apparently he must have copied these
condensed sentences from some old journal a simi
lar topic the very baldness and dryness of concise
narration or rather registering of facts recommends
the old english chroniclers as authentic historians 
and to a very great extent marks the style of the old
testament history y a third reason for believing
that the witnesses would not lie is sometimes be
cause the crime may be too atrocious perhaps they
will tell many lies but not such a lie as this also
 it may be a thing discreditable or hurtful to them
selves or against their cause and party or preposses
sions thus we believe livy when he tells of the
roman aristocracy assassinating a tribune and so
proud of the crime that those who did not participate
feigned to have had a hand in it while the historian
himself speaks of it with horror we believe cla
rendon when he speaks to the discredit of the kings
cause and character and the most incredulous of
men would believe the tales recorded by the jewish
historians to the discredit of their own nation
such are the principal topics available even when
we distrust ever so much the accuracy and veracity
of witnesses and which are a fortiori applicable in
other cases
ii witnesses of high character good character



veracity of informants

for veracity is generally only relative to the matter
testified as observed above cases exist where a
lie is so atrocious and so wanton a crime that a
witness of indifferent character is thought incapable
of it a very ordinary englishman speaks truth
when the fortune and life of another is at stake and
we demand no higher guarantee of his veracity than
the negative one that he has no interest in falsehood
doubtless there is such a thing as absolute veracity
but it is only in regard to intimate friends that we
are often able to appreciate this and our testimony
to such a quality in them is not very cogent to
persuade others of it because our very friendship
may have biassed us our conviction must depend
 on an insight into his principles and sentiments 
 on experience of his conduct if there is in him
an elevation of soul a hatred of meanness and con
cealment a general uprightness and generosity a
consistency of goodness which fears no investigation 
if moreover it is based on a high principle of religion
as in imitation of him who cannot lie on the one
hand on the other if we have seen him submit to
trials and losses rather than violate truth and this
in cases where the violation seemed practically harm
less Ã¢€”where he had the precedent of others perhaps
great or good menÃ¢€”where it would not be thought
disgraceful by the world at large Ã¢€”or where truth
drew after it painful exposures or losses to those in
whom he was interested Ã¢€”such are the elements on
which our opinion of his veraciousness will depend
but not very much can rest on this one unsupported
topic since a mans reputation is soon broken down

veracity op informants



if we lay too great a load on it one marvellous
story for instance we may believe on his bare word
but if he tell three or four it is too much to bear
without collateral evidence again the world is too
wicked and too suspicious to make it desirable to rest
much on the reputation of an individual this is not
the way to get the tale believed some have so
loose principles as to suspect all virtue of hypocrisy
and believe that every man has his price them
selves perhaps accustomed to justify lying in ex
treme cases they are not sure whether the case in
question may not have been viewed as an extreme
case by the witness much as pious frauds during
many ages of the church besides goodness ensures
only one element the disposition to tell truth good
sense and soundness of mind accuracy caution
sobriety and other qualities are often needed and
it can never be improper to look for some manifest
ation of these in the evidence itself
it is then generally expedient to superadd even in
the case of witnesses of the very best character
topics borrowed from the other two heads proceed
therefore
thirdly to those whom i have described as having
no character and whose character is to be if possible
made out by us by help of their own depositions
of course if we succeed in this we may afterwards
treat them as belonging to the heads already spoken
of
a large majority of literary documents urgently
need to have their characters thus made out and
this is the most important part of the art of criti



veracity of informants

cism the actors and the writers have passed oft
the stage of life we cannot seek their personal inter
course nor gain access to their intimate friends we
cannot crossexamine them nor use the ordinary
methods of investigating their veracity but analo
gous methods are yet available litera scripta
manet and we have ample time to try them it
is not one nor twelve men that sit as judges over
them but the whole body of the literati perhaps of
several nations if their testimony be of weight and
extensive interest the accumulated intellect of
many generations is sometimes made to bear on the
inquiry a superficial reasoner may treat this with
contempt as an extravagant and ridiculous expendi
ture of thought and pains about what is for ever
past and gone perhaps the experience of a great
bookmaker registered in sacred writ may be quoted
that of making many books there is no end and
much study is a weariness to the flesh this pro
bably is a rebuke on literary pursuits when made
an end in themselves instead of a means to solid
advantage and instruction to the heart as well as to
the head indeed it cannot be denied that in the art
of criticism as in most antiquarian researches there
is much to provoke ridicule from the ignorant it
is largely built on apparent trifles such as are those
minutias which distinguish the dialect the ortho
graphy the characters the writing materials of dif
ferent tribes and ages these are as important in
such inquiries as are the tones and manner of a
witness or the minor details which juries often
so laboriously and commendably investigate and

veracity of informants



rightly viewing the subject after allowing that undiscriminating zeal carries many antiquaries beyond
the mark we yet must remember that it is some
times only by the result that this is learned if
we are severe in exacting that each separate course
of investigation shall answer the question cui
bono beforehand numerous useful inquiries will be
smothered before they have time to bear fruit
those who reap the benefit of the researches of
laborious critics are not always grateful for them
nor sensible how valuable an office both to the world
and to the church of christ is performed by the
faithful and able antiquarian if historical remains be
ill treated if the respective value of different authorities
be not ascertained falsehood usurps the place of
truth a false color at least is given to facts and the
study of history misleads rather than informs if
due criticism of old documents be neglected spuri
ous works are easily obtruded on us as genuine the
scriptures themselves may be corrupted or corruptly
translated apocryphal books incorporated with it
and in numerous ways the mind not of individuals
only but of nations may receive a bias dangerous
and mischievous
after this digression i proceed to present in as
orderly a form as i am able the principal heads of
examination there seem to be four chief requisites
for the witness 
Ã¢° access to adequate sources of knowledge
Ã¢° ability to use them with discrimination
Ã¢° habit of accuracy
Ã¢° disposition to tell truth



veracity of informants

 Ã¢° his sources of knowledge a if the witness
tells us what they are we are sometimes able to
consider whether they are adequate when livy
tells that the documents of roman history perished
in the conflagration of rome by the gauls so that
he manifestly knew of no other source of knowledge
concerning the years said to have preceded than
tradition it is for us to consider what is the value
of tradition moreover a mans own account of the
sources of his information will often betray lax
notions of evidence credulity and want of good
sense or again may show the opposite qualities
 if he does not tell us his authorities or means of
knowledge we must try to conceive and invent
them else we might believe a man who should
write a history of the moon thus one who pre
tends to know too much is discredited ctesias
pretends to sucha minute knowledge of the affairs of
ancient india and babylon that perhaps this cause
alone would suffice to confute the whole as a romance
again by contrast when we set thucydidess con
fessed inability to learn the numbers engaged and
the numbers slain in battles some of which he wit
nessed against livys accurate acquaintance with
the same at remote periods we gain some insight
into the trustworthiness of the narratives
sometimes specimens may be had of the documents
relied on which forms a valuable check on the author
the superstitious reverence gained in heathen lands
by priests and conjurors is connected with this topic
because of their obviously superior knowledge of
things visible a large knowledge is also attributed

veracity of informants



to them of things invisible it is often very difficult
to the uninstructed to apprehend what sources of
knowledge are adequate to the case in hand
Ã¢° ability to use them this must depend
a upon general soundness of mind freedom from
credulity or incredulity qualities displayed partly in
treating the particular subject of evidence but also
in numerous other ways some are credulous on
special subjects but of sound mind on others as
probably john wesley was credulous about ghosts
and spiritual influence herodotus was credulous as
to stories reported to him in part through a con
sciousness how many marvels unknown to him the
world contained but is a very sound and competent
witness of all which came under his own senses
numerous other causes produce credulity or incre
dulity which i shall have presently to name as
affecting the disposition to tell truth since the
same cause which makes men unwilling to tell
makes them unwilling to believe and conversely
 again the ability to use good information often
depends largely upon previous knowledge perhaps
of the language of some people their habits laws c
there are reasons for valuing a history of eng
land written by a frenchman especially those parts
of our history concerning which party spirit biasses
natives but herein we should purchase exemption
from that bias by a certain sacrifice as numerous
other points would probably be mistaken by the
foreigner allowing that the foreigner might be a
good compiler of history we should expect his
annals or journal of his own times spent among

us to be full of mistakes and undoubtedly travellers
do make great blunders from unavoidable ignorance
y in cases of scientific facts scientific knowledge is
generally requisite to record them with accuracy 
insomuch that the description of any disease drawn
up by an unprofessional observer would seldom be
instructive to a physician yet natural intelligence
and aptitude may go a great way
Ã¢° habit ofaccuracy this is brought to the test
sometimes by precise and definite trial sometimes
by minor marks a the most obvious thing is to
examine a writers agreement with himself not only
where he is likely to study accuracy but in lesser
matters thus when livy describes the romans as
fighting in legionary armour and order prior to the
time when this armour and order was by his own
account as well as that of others introduced we see
that he is less accurate than modern novelists
 sometimes we are able to bring the matter into
comparison with personal or recent examination the
credit of herodotus has in this way much risen as
the state of modern egypt and the caravan stages
in africa and much that is recently learned of
barbarous tribes in regions described by him agree
far more nearly with facts of modern research than
could have been supposed to compare the dis
tances of places mentioned by herodotus or xenophon with modern measured distances throws light
on the sort of accuracy to be expected from them in
other such cases y the consistency of a witness
with the testimony of other approved witnesses will
be examined when possible thus in describing the

veracity of informant



march of hannibal over the alps polybius describes
a particular place as wholly bare of trees while
livy in other respects closely following him here
inserts the tale of their splitting the rocks with
vinegar after cutting down lofty trees and burn
ing them consistency with what is natural and
with a priori probability is a topic not to be
omitted when treating of the marks of accuracy 
though sometimes it cannot be used the most
unlikely stories are sometimes true and sometimes
that which at first sight is the more likely version
of a tale is nothing but an arbitrary correction
griesbach has much used the topic that a reading
which is unlikely to be invented because it is so
hard or uncouth is more probably true than an
easier reading but this principle may be pushed
so far as to violate all common sense s if inaccu
racies be detected it is well to consider whether they
are in connexion with a rhetorical spirit love of fine
writing and tendency to exaggerate when it will
turn a period or point a tale if so this gives
insight into the peculiar kinds of inaccuracy we are
to expect in the writer r again the inaccuracies
may result from false notions current in any age and
country belief in witchcraft magic or other super
stitions not only produce credulity but lead to a very
inaccurate statement or distortion of facts laziness
may be detected in special cases such as to infuse a
suspicion that the same cause has acted largely
thus when livy quotes certain linen books in a
library at rome by hearsay merely because he
would not take the trouble of going to examine



veracity of informants

them it is argued that he has probably much neg
lected the sources of information really open to him
j the peculiarities of individuals may also be
studied thus in copyists sometimes carelessness
predominates sometimes servility nor is it always
easy to distinguish them for the servile copyist
purposely and sedulously adopts the error of his
predecessor but when a class of copyists are fairly
suspected of servility as the jewish a gross error
ought to be imputed to this cause when it exists in
many mss a slight error found in many mss is
fairly attributable to the author some copyists
have a trick of correcting the opposite of servility
carried far beyond what they had any right to think
slips of the pen
Ã¢° disposition to tell truth this depends partly
on a mans principles absolutely and partly on his
bias in particular cases
principles Ã¢ some like plutarch give us to
understand that the chief object of their tale is not
the truth of it but the moral a principle perfectly
akin to that of pious frauds when any writer
like st chrysostom defends falsehood for the good
of the church and for other good ends he of course
destroys his own character for veracity and in a
measure the character of all who seem likely to be
influenced by similar principles some like thucydides exhibit naturally and unconstrainedly on
fitting occasions such just sentiments and such a
love of truth as greatly to prepossess us in favor of
their veracity especially when this is joined with
y in his book concerning the priesthood

veracity of informaxt



a discriminating moral judgment on most points
y some like sallust draw overstrained pictures and
are evidently aiming to act the philosopher and
censor of morals this detracts from his authority
especially since his own profligacy is well known
nearly the same may be said of juvenal they
doubtless wilfully draw as black a picture as they are
able habitual reverence for a certain authority
is a matter closely to be watched over since while it
affects the medium through which every thing is
seen both coloring and distorting facts its action is
so uniform and tranquil and the picture resulting is
often so consistent with itself that suspicion of the
unfairness will possibly not enter the mind of him
who accepts the testimony this head principally
includes what is also called a religious bias or a
scientific bias yet as it is perhaps systematically
knowingly and even professedly adopted i have
classed it with the principles of action
bias under this head i must include the causes
which produce credulity and incredulity as well as
those which produce wilful falsehood or suppression 
because the two things so run into each other as to
be hardly separable
we may have reason to suspect a personal in
terest or credit to be lost or gained fear of
offending those in power or desire of pleasing them
the air of a court grievously corrupts truth many
even love to please and flatter the great for the mere
sake of the thing itself or from inveterate habit
this we may call courtierlike spirit y national



veracity of informants

partialities here we may contrast the greek histo
rians full of the crimes of their own nation with
livy who always argues a case to prove the romans
in the right who seems to think no other nations to
compare to them in virtue and ceases to extol their
excellencies only in times too recent to allow of gross
fiction family friendships polybius is un
biassed except when treating of his patrons the
scipio family and perhaps the achaean towns his
native state what is called esprit de corps will
rank under the same head e party spirit or
faction is a stronger passion often inducing a
perversion of truth that at first looks like deepseated malice but as it acts intensely only on
particular occasions and betrays itself by its incon
sistencies it is not so formidable an enemy to truth
as undue reverence to some one authority the
moral temperament of the author is sometimes not
to be overlooked often depending on the school in
which he has been trained whether gloomy or
cheerful severe or mild nor must we omit to
mention the love of the marvellous and romantic
ij there is also a bias resulting from an excited
state of mind closely connected with the last head 
and which is most delusive when it overspreads a
whole age or nation thus the greeks at the close
of the great persian invasion were so possessed with
overwrought feeling that vast exaggerations may
have passed for realities
on hearing so large a recital of causes which bias
testimony and distort the truth it may seem as though

veracity of informants



nothing could be depended on but they are only so
many perturbing forces the power of which generally
ranges within narrow limits when we have access to
original testimony it is comparatively seldom that false
testimony is capable of assuming great plausibility 
or if at all it is on the less important subjects and
times as it is with the errors of instruments and of
observations so with the errors of human witnesses
when multiplied their tendency is to neutralize each
other since not all are biassed one way often too
the existence of some bias is the very thing which
above all accredits the testimony if it seems to be a
concession extorted by truth the chief difficulty is
in secular perturbations to speak as an astronomer
might when a whole age has imbibed the same
spirit or even a succession of ages reaching down
to our own days has been infected with a common
bias leading to a detracting and calumniating of
those whose writings have not come down to us and
whose lives are known to us only by their adver
saries a fallen dynasty meets not much mercy from
the historians of the triumphant party nor persons
Ã¢– who have been named heretics from a universally
triumphant church large allowance is often requi
site where we cannot hear both sides and sometimes
it is right to suspend the judgment entirely
lastly it would be very unjust to regard a persons
testimony as invalid because he may be supposed
subject to a particular bias every person is liable
to stand in positions where a bias may be naturally
suspected and especially those who have most oppor

tunities of access to information in many affairs
yet if it have been shown in particular cases that
the bias has not been permitted to interfere with
truth we do not allow suspicion to be thrown on
his veracity in other cases on the mere ground of the
possibility of it so acting
