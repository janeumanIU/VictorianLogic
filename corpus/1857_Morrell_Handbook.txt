preface 



thbre can be no doubt i think that the whole system of 
english education has hitherto been greatly wanting in the 
sound development of the powers of ahatract thinking the 
proper road nevertheless to the cultivation of these powers 
appears to me to be very simple the natural introduction into 
the whole region of the abstract is undoubtedly an intelligent 
study of grammar for grammar is the science of language and 
language shows the natural mode in which we generalise our 
sensations and ideas affcer the principles of grammar have 
been well understood the laws of thought which are spontane 
ously involved in language should be studied more scientificatty 
and to do this we want a simple introduction to logic after 
logic the next step should be an elementary treatise on the 
human mind viewed in relation both to the teacher and the 
taught 

this then is the plan of an elementary discipline which has 
been for some time before my mind and whidh i have now 
partly realised the essentials of english grammar was 
intended to be a simple introduction to the study of granmiar 
generally and consequently is adapted rather to explain prin 
ciples than to enter into all the minutiae of the english lan 
guage next the analysis of sentences was intended to 
go somewhat further than english grammar ordinarily has done 
in this country into the general structure of language as an 
organ of thought this end i trust it has accomplished and 
i am pleased here to record my satisfaction at the large amount 
of interest which has already become manifested in the method 
of study there expounded

iv prefaci 

i now offer the present little work as one farther contrihntion 
to my general plan the object of a brief coarse of logic is to 
exercise the intellectual factdtiesj to accustom them to abstract 
processes and to giye some idea of the general laws of thought 
in doing so i have followed with the excisption of the introduce 
tion the usual aristotelian road belieying as i do that even if the 
system of aristotle be capable of grat simplification which no 
doubt it is yet there will be both a good exercise of the intel 
lect as well as some historical interest in treading along this 
oldpathf which was so diligently beaten by our forefathers in the 
middle ages the mode of presenting the subject however will 
i hope be found here much simplified as to the illustrations 
and exercises i have partly made them myself and partly culled 
them from other books on formal logic the student will 
find in going steadily through this handbook every thing 
essential to the subject but if his cariosity leads him to go a 
little further in the same direction he might study archbishop 
whatelys excellent treatise and then the port royal logic as 
translated by mr baynes of edinburgh at any rate i should 
strongly recommend every student to work all the exercises 
given at the end of the book as he proceeds for it is only by 
making such attempts for himself that he can possibly derive 
much mental discipline from the study of the subject 

if i can spare sufficient time from my official duties i hope 
one of these days to complete my plan in the form of an ele 
mentary psychology viewed expressly in reference to education

elements of logic 



preliminary explanations 

 

l 

all our knowledge begins in the order of time with 
the exercise of the senses when any part of the ner 
vous system is affected and a feeling is produced of 
which the mind is conscious such feeling is termed a 
sensation sensation does not imply any knowledge 
of the external object affecting us — not even of its 
existence it is confined wholly to the oonsciousness 
of the internal impression 

 

if our mental life consisted merely in the conscious 
ness of successive impressions there would be no unity 
or connexion in it very soon accordingly in the 
order of the minds growth the sensations experienced 
begin to cluster round a central point to which they all 
alike stand related this central point we term self 
consciousness t is the instinctive feeling we possess 
that all our sensational impressions belong to one sub 
ject which we afterwards term self or the me 

 

with the rise of selfconsciousness there is deve 
loped contemporaneously the consciousness of an

external world — of its primary qualities and its per 
petual changes this power which the mind possesses 
of passing from the inward feeling to the external 
object producing it is termed perception 

the neuter verb • i feel strangely corresponds with a cti 
sation the active verb i feel the table corresponds with 
an act of perception 

 

perception — or as it is sometimes termed intuition 
— is the primary form of human knowledge that 
which arises from the first direct action of the world 

j without upon the mental factilties it is by perception 

or intuition that we come to know the properties of 
matter as they exist in time and space — extension 
size resistance motion c and it is by a similar 
i intuitive process that on the presentation of the proper 

external conditions we experience ther elementary 
consciousness of beauty proportion harmony right 
and reverence 

all the elements of human knowledge in fact exist 
primarily in the form of intuition before they are 
brought into a more definite state by the processes we 
have yet to explain 

 

the very same effort which leads the mind to per 
ceive objects external to itself leads it also to grasp 
them with the greatest possible degree of clearness 
this efibrt is called attention 

in directing our attention to an outward phenome 
non we pass by the minor points and seizing naturally 
ill upon the most striking features of it retain them with 

more than ordinary distinctness before our view thus 
the mind by virtue of its own activity constructs a 
new and peculiar aspect of this phenomenon and by 
so doing prepares the way as we shall see for another 
erj important process in our mental history 



 



 

the more free and active the mind is in performing 
any operation the more permanent is the result in 
sensation the mind is least free or spontaneous and 
consequently we cannot recall a purely sensational im 
pression with any thing approaching its original inten 
sity in perception the mind is more free than 
in sensation • and consequently our intuitions can be 
much more perfectly reproduced than our sensations 
when however the mind has had its attention ener 
getically directed to a phenomenon when it has seized 
upon the prominent features and constructed a peculiar 
point of view for itself the idea of it thus formed may 
return with almost the same vividness with which it 
was first experienced in the presence of the object 
itself this reproduction we term memory 

 

in sensation we experience internally a feeling pro 
duced by some affection of the nervous system in 
perception we interpret this feeling and attribute it to 
the object with which we stand as it were face to face 
in attention we idealise this object by letting the un 
important features disappear and by seizing the more 
prominent points of view lastly in memory we rc 
peat this act of attention when the object is no longer 
present and thus make an internal representation of 
it to ourselves this we term a representative idea 

 

when we store up a number of these ideas in the 
mind disconnect them from the external phenomena 
from which they first took their rise and then recom 
bine them into new forms or images we are said to be 
exercising the imagination the order in which the 
ideas come and go the one calling up or suggesting 
the other depends upon what are termed the laws of 
association 

a 



 



 



all the processed we have hitherto described nkay 
go on without the aid of language our intuitions 
are felt or experienced internally but they can never 
be adequately expressed no words can convey to any 
one the full realisation of an object which he has never 
seen for the same reason memory and imagination 
as dealing with the elements of our actual experiences 
lie partially beyond the range of language also in 
consequence of this the mental images we experience 
in the processes of memory and imaginationy are inde 
finite and variable — merging often like dissolving 
views one into the other just as we often realise them 
in our dreams it is only when they are embodied in 
 an external sign that they first heeome fixed are held 
clearly apart and are thus raised above the fluctuations 
of our inward and more individual experiences 

 

when the mind has once created language as the 
objective embodiment of its ideas it possesses an organ 
by means of which it can proceed to a range of far 
higher intellectual processes than would have been 
possible without it every object which we contem 
plate externally presents to us a cluster of qualities 
constituting the entire phenomenon that we term a 
thing we have already seen that in the process of 
attention the minor features of such phenomena dis 
appear so that we grasp only the more prominent 
points now it may so happen that a great number 
of different things all agree in alike possessing these 
prominent features on which the attention has become 
fixed 

thus all the different kinds of trees are alike distinguished 
by the possession of trunk branches leaves roots c however 
different in other respects 

passing by therefore their numerous differences we 



£nd that they all unite in one general representation 
if the general representation then be in each case fixed 
and designated by a sign it will soon become evident 
that the very same term may be equally well applied to 
a great number of individual existences that it will 
express what is alike essential to them all and that 
it may be henceforth used as the common sign for the 
entire class this process is termed generalisation 

 

by a slight variation of the process we may separate 
any given quality from a number of difierent objects 
this quality when thus separated viewed apart from 
the several objects to which it belongs and fixed by a 
term becomes what we call an abstract idea the 
process of forming it is then called abstraction 

 

having arrived then so far the mind can banish at 
will the whole concrete world with its various images 
and impulses from the consciousness and occupy itself 
for a time only with abstractions and generalisations 
as exhibited in words the mental faculty which deals 
thus with abstract and general ideas fixes their pre 
cise meaning ranges them one over the other in the 
order of their generality classifies our knowledge 
under them into definite heads forms them into pro 
positions and draws conclusions from one set of pro 
positions to another is called the understanding 

 

the understanding proceeds according to certain 
fixed laws termed the laws of thought the region 
of our intuitions and of our representative ideas is not 
pervaded by any fixed and absolute laws whatever 
much depends in their case on the peculiar constitution 
of the individual mind and the circumstances in which 
it is placed the succession of our ideas and the com

bination of them into new forms is we know to 
great extent arbitrary once however project the 
images out of ourselves — objectify them — emboc 
them in terms which are adequately defined by the 
relation to other terms and the whole process becom 
subject to definite laws which the mind is constrain 
to look upon as absolute 

 

the absoluteness of the laws of thought flows fro 
the very nature of the processes of abstraction ar 
generalisation in a pure generalisation we sink i 
reference to the intuitions out of which it has be 
elaborated and consider the designating term only 
reference to the other terms which it includes under 
thus the word eagle is used in natural history 
designate a certain class of birds including some ar 
excluding otiiers the meaning of it is wholly dete 
mined by the enumeration of certain qualities tl 
abstract idea therefore conveyed by the term eagle 
definitely fixed by the understanding though we m 
have no experience whatever of the thing itself ar 
every general term in like manner looked at apa 
from any actual experience of the thing must 
reckoned as a sign standing in a given quantitati 
relation to other signs 

to investigate these relations is simply performir 
a species of calculation with words as our cipher 
language gives us the ciphers ready formed and h 
already partially determined by use how they shou 
 stand in the order of generality all we have to d 

ii then is to calculate the precise relations we m£ 

require to know as existing between any two or mo 
terms that language supplies and thus to make the 
ti perfectly clear to our comprehension in this w£ 

our knowledge so far as it reaches is rendered precis 
definite and explicit the fixed principles accordir 
to which we are necessarily led to classify our kno 



 

ledge in the order of generality and carry on all com 
municatioh between mind and mind through the means 
of ideas thus arranged are what we mean by the laws 
of thought 

 

the purport of logic then is to investigate these 
fixed laws of thought to show us the principles hy 
which our understanding is governed and to guard 
us in this way against all possible fallacies in rea 
soning 

the above psychological explanations give us a clear deter 
mination of the real province of logic properly so called 
they show us — 

 that logic has to do only with the ybrmo laws of thinking j 
and takes no cognisance of the truth or falsehood of the ideas 
themselves 

 that logic only investigates the laws of thoughts as em 
bodied and represented in language for it is only by means of 
language that the understanding properly so called can operate 
at all hence the philosophic truthfulness of the double meaning 
attached to the greek term xoyos 

 that logic is a science and not an art investigating a 
system of fixed laws and thus influencing the mind as a disci 
pline rather than teaching it a craft 

 that logic is the most abstract of the sciences as having 
nothing to do with the matter but only with the forms of our 
thoughts 

 

division of the subject 

our exposition of the subject will fall under four 
heads 

i on concepts and terms 
ir on propositions 

iii on reasoning 

iv on fallacies 



 



i on concepts and terms 

 

it has been already shown that the laws of thought 
all flow from the very nature of the processes of ab 
straction and generalisation when an abstract or a 
generalised idea has been formed in the mind we call 
it a concept and when expressed by an outward sign 
we call it a term our next duty then will be to 
explain what logic has to teach us in reference to 
concepts since much will henceforth depend upon a 
proper understanding of them 

this branch of logic has been usually termed the doctrine 
of simple apprehension this expression we consider is open 
to objection we apprehend things in various ways — by 
perception by the imagination by the reason etc whereas in 
logic we have only to do with the apprehension of generalised 
and abstract ideas in the understanding the word concept 
exactly answers to this latter signification — it is a single idea 
in which a number of particulars are held together the ex 
pression moreover was often used by the old english writers 
only written conceit instead of concept and it has more recently 
been brought anew into use by sir w hamilton 

 
the origin and nature of concepts 

this has been partly explained already in describing 
the processes of abstraction and generalisation the 
mind we will suppose has stored up a vast variety of 
images or ideas formed from its actual perceptions 
amongst these ideas it finds a number which possess 
certain resemblances to each other by confining our 
attention to these points of resemblance and neglecting 
every thing else we form one general idea which in 
cludes in it all the given individuals this general 
idea is what we term a concept which it will be seen 
is merely an ideal whole formed in order the more 
conveniently to classify our knowledge t e to gather 
up the details of it under certain general heads 



 

the function of a concept therefore is to give us 
not a full but only a partial or inadequate knowledge 
of the things to which it relates it is indicated by 
a mark or sign which designates indeed a certain 
number of individuals but does so only in so far as 
they agree in some common point of resemblance it 
exists therefore as a unity only in thought and not 
at all in nature 

for example we gain by perception a great number of 
experiences respecting birds of all sizes shapes and colours 
in all these experiences we seize upon a certain common re 
semblance — and designate the general idea thus formed by the 
term bird 

bird therefore as thought by us is a concept holding within 
its meaning a certain number of individuals or regarded ver 
bally it is a mark connoting certain other marks with it 

it is also a purely ideal creation having nothing answering 
to it in nature as a whole but is simply created by the mind 
out of the different experiences to which it has a common 
reference 

once more it conveys only an inadequate knowledge of the 
things themselves for it marks only the common property of 
birds and neglects all the other details respecting them 

its use is finally to classify our knowledge and prevent the 
necessity of infinite detail in the employment of terms and in the 
expression of our thoughts 

 

classification of terms 

terms are divided into two great classes the one 
called singular the other universal 

a singular term is one which is applied only to one 
thing that is which only marks an individual as 
julius caesar the queen of england such a term 
is really abstract in its character since it does not 
mark any one given experience but denotes a ge 
neral idea of the individual object formed out of all 
the detailed experiences which we hare had respect 
ing it 

a universal term is one which can he vis 



 

several things in the same sense as man horse 
tree 

various other classifications of abstract terms have been made 
which are not of sufficient importance to the science of liogic to 
claim any special attention 

thus terms have been divided into 

 substantives nouns 

 attributives adjectives 

again into 

 concrete viewed in connexion with the individual 
object 

 abstract viewed apart from such connexion 

again into 

 positive denoting a reality 

 negative denoting the aenre of reality 

again into 

 definite marking oat the precise object 

 indefinite not marking out the precise object 

cum multis aliis 

 
extension and comprehension 

the process of generalisation may proceed only to 
a very small degree and thus form a concept having 
a very few objects noted under it or it may proceed 
to a very high degree and include an immense number 
of objects all united into one concept by extremely 
general resemblances 

thus the term englishman is less general than 
european european less general than man man 
less general than animal animal less general than 
organised being and organised being less general 
than substance 

by the extension of a term then we mean the 
precise degree of generality that is attached to it 
thus an individual or singular term has the least ex 
tension a universal word like substance the 
greatest extension 

the comprehension of a term signifies just the 
reverse of the extension in proportion as any term 



 

becomes less general it comprehends a greater number 
of ideas under it and is more complex in its significa 
tion thus the word european comprehends more 
ideas in it than the word man and man more than 
animal 

while the extension of a term accordingly depends 
upon the number of individuals it includes the com 
prehension depends upon the complexity of tlie ideas 
the term substance involves all possible individual 
existences ie has the greatest possible extension 
the individual term caesar comprehends in it on the 
other hand all the ideas which are involved in the 
more general terms european man animal or 
ganised being and substance the one marks the 
universality oi un idea — the other marks ms complexity 

hence the greater the extension of a concept the 
less the comprehension and vice versa the greater 
the comprehension the less the extension 

 
predicables 

to predicate is to affirm one thing of another in 
making an aihrmation tlie thing predicated must neces 
sarily be more general than that respecting which the 
affirmation is made thus if i say animals are men 
the proposition is untrue in its whole extent if i 
say human beings are men the proposition is true 
but merely verbal if i say men are animals then 
there is a valid assertion made which is universally 
true 

in the first the subject of the assertion is more 
general than tlie predicate in the second they have 
both the same degree of generality while in the third 

 sometimes the predicate is literally speaking of the same 
generaliiy as the subject only consisting of more intelligible ian 
gunge but in these cases the affirmation only amounts to 
piere definition terma and does not convey any new truth 



 

the predicate is more general than the subject all 
predicates then are of necessity general or universal 
terms but some of course more general than others 
the doctrine of the predicables is an attempt to classify 
them in reference to their generality that is to arrange 
in due order under certain heads every kind of truth 
that can be properly predicated of any subject 

if i affirm of an individual thing that it belongs to 
a certain class as this flower is arose i designate 
in so doing the species if i affirm of a flower that 
it is a vegetable production i now designate the 
genus if i say man is rational i designate neither 
genus nor species distinctively but the particular 
quality which distinguishes him from all other beings 
this is termed the differentia once more if i say 
 man is vertebrated i designate again a universal 
property in man — though not the distinguishing one 
this then is termed simply proprium lastly if i say 
 that man is redhaired i designate a fact which is 
a mere accident to the individual — accidens 

thus then we may predicate of a thing — 

 its genus its species its diflerentia 
 its properties its accidents 

genus the genus is the most universal of the 
predicables so universal that it always has one or 
more species under it it is not always however of 
the same degree of generality hence the distinction of 
summum genus and genus suhalternum the suni 
mum genus is that which has no more universal term 
over it such as substance if a genus on the con 
trary has other genera over it though of course several 
species under it then it is called genus subalternum 
thus the word dog has the term animal above it 
and many different species of dogs below it it is 
therefore a subaltern genus 

species species denotes primarily a class having 
only individuals under it it is frequently used how 
ever to denote species of a more general kind hence 



 

the distinction between species infimay and species 

suhaltema if a species denote the lowest possible 

class it is called species infima if it have classes as 

well as individuals under it it is termed species sub 

alterna hence summum genus and species injima 

stand at the two extremes of generality while au the 

intermediate steps may either be termed a subaltern 

species or a subaltern genus according as they are 

regarded in relation to more general terms above them 

or less general ones beneath them 

thus dog is a subaltern genus in reference to the yarious 
species of dogs but a subaltern species in reference to the 
different kinds of animals 

differentia the differentia is the one particular 
property which marks a species and distinguishes it 
from all others thus the property rational is the 
distinguishing feature of man in reference to all other 
animals 

proprium by proprium we mean logically a pro 
perty which is universal and necessary to a whole 
genus or species but which is possessed at the same 
time by certain other genera or species as well it 
coincides with the differentia in being a universal at 
tribute but differs from it in not being peculiar 

accidens an accident is a property which may or 
may not belong to an individual viewed in relation to 
a species or to a species viewed in relation to a genus 
some accidents are termed separable others insepa 
rable — the former when they can be separated in 
thought from the individual the latter when such 
separation is impossible e m cousin is an inha 
bitant of paris denotes a separable accident because 
he might live elsewhere but m cousin is a native 
of paris is an inseparable accident since the fact can 
never possibly be otherwise

predicables taking man as the subject the words

as the fredicables give us a classification of all 
possible predicates to any given subject so the cate 
gories were intended to classify under a given number 
of heads all the subjects respecting which any thing 
can be predicated aristotles classification is as 
follows — 

 substance 

 quantity 

 quality 

 relation 

 action 

 passion 

 place 

 time 

 posture 
 habit 



 

this classification is now generally allowed to be 
both useless and incorrect the attempt to classify all 
our ideas is so purely a metaphysical problem that it is 
for the most part excluded from treatises on formal 
logic and assigned over to the proper science to 
which it really belongs 



 
division 

by division we mean the distribution of a logical 
wuole into its several parts this process is exactly 
the opposite of generalisation in generalisation we 
lay aside the difierences and form a mental unity out 
of a number of individuals agreeing in some given 
point in division we start from a generalised idea 
and by adding on the differences before laid aside 
redistribute it into its more specific parts thus by 
adding the points of distinction we may divide the 
word metal into gold silver iron lead etc 

the use of division is to assist us in the accurate 
apprehension of any given term which it does by 
presenting the several things which are really included 
under the one common name to divide a subject 
accurately the following rules should be observed — 

st the division must be adequate t e the parts 
must be exactly equal to the whole neither more nor 
less thus if in enumerating the parts of speech we 
were to leave out the preposition or insert the par 
ticiple we should err in the first instance by defect 
in the second by redundancy 

nd the division must be distinct i e the 
parts must really be disjunct and opposed to each 
other when we fail in this respect t e when we 
depart from the principle of classification with which 
we set out and enumerate some two or more terms 
which really include each other we are guilty of what 

b 



 

is called a cross division thus to divide all the land 
into continents islands and peninsulas would be n 
cross division inasmuch as first and third term may 
include each other 

rd the division should be made into parts which 
stand in the same order of generality in reference to 
the whole if this rule be not observed some one of 
the terms of a lower degree of generality will most 
probably be included in one of the others or if this 
is not the case then the division will be inadequate 
the best division is that in which the subject is divided 
into its proximate parts i e into parts only one de 
gree removed in the order of generality from the sub 
ject itself 

there is nothing more important for giving clearness and 
order to onr mental operations than to divide the subject on 
ihich we are thinking with the utmost logical accuracy the 
above rules if rigidly adhered to would obviate many a diffi 
culty and render simple what otherwise seems inextricably 
confused 

it will add much to the facility with which a division is effected 
if we keep in mind the different sentea in which the term whole 
is emiloyed 

 a logiccd whole means a genus while the parts of it are 
the species 

 a formal whole is one which is made up of the parts of 
definition rational animal is a formal whole of which the 
parts are rationality and animal existence 

 an essential whole is viewed in reference to the component 
parts thus man is a whole the body and the soul the parts 

 an integral whole is made up of separable parts a plant 
is a whole the root stem leaves and blossom the parts 

it is simply the first kind of whole that we are immediately 
concerned with in a logical division as that only depends upon 
the laws of generalisation 

 

definition 

fe 

 definition in logic means the perfect explanation 

of what is implied by a given term general terms 



 

are frequently learned by us the real process of 
whose formation we know nothing about hence the 
necessity of their being properly defined in order that 
we may employ them correctly to understand a 
terra accurately we must know two points respecting 
it first in what respect it agrees with other terms 
secondly in what respect it differs from them now 
we show the agreement when we point out the genus 
to which it belongs and we show the disagreement 
when we point out the differentia hence the rule for 
the logical definition of a term is — that we assign its 
genus and its differentia for in that way we express 
the whole essence of the thing in question 

care should be taken that a definition is acetae i e 
neither too extensive nor too narrow if we define a 
violin to be a musical instrument with four strings 
the definition is too extensive or in other words the 
differentia is not correctly assigned so if we define 
an animal to be an organised being with a vertebrated 
spine the definition is too narrow 

species alone admit of real definition the 
summum genus and the individual can only be de 
cribed for we cannot point out either their genus or 
differentia the same may be said of indefinite and 
negative terms of aggregates and concretes 

metaphorical terms are more or less used by all writers and 
speakers and used frequently when they are hardly aware of 
it it is needless to say that such terms do not admit of exact 
definition they must rather be explained — stripped of their 
figurative dress — put into a purely abstract form — and then 
defined

n on feopositions 
 

hitherto we have treated only of individual terms 
and concepts we have shown how they are formed 
how classified how they may he regarded in relation 
to their extension and comprehension how divided 
and how defined a single term does not express 
however a complete thought to do this we require a 
proposition that is according to the usual definition 
 a judgment clothed in words 

every proposition logically considered consists of 
three parts the subject the predicate and the copula 
the subject is that of which something is afiirmed 
the predicate is that which we declare respecting the 
subject the copula consisting of the substantive verb 
 to be connects the two terms together 

sub cop pred 

man is mortal 

in logic the proposition is always regarded as existing in one 
particular form namely as consisting of two terms coupled 
together by the verb to be it is needless to say that gram 
maucauy speaking the proposition assumes a variety of other 
forms the copula being often concealed in the finite verb 



 

substance of propositions 

with regard to their substance propositions are 
either simple or compound a simple proposition is 
said to be categorical because it makes one direct 
assertion without any condition or qualification 

all men are mortal 

compound propositions occur in various forms 
some are copulative some disjunctive some hypothe 
tical and some adversative of these we shall speak 
hereafter • 



 

categorical propositions are sometimes divided into pure and 
modal a pure categorical proposition is one which asserts a 
truth without any qudification whatever a modal proposition 
is one which asserts a truth in some particular form or with 
some particular qualification as 

john is gone home — pure 

john is probably gone home — modal 

in modal propositions the assertion is called the dictum the 
qualification the modus every modal proposition may be con 
verted into a simple one by turning the dictum into a subject 
and the modus into a predicate and then forming a new pro 
position of them thus that john has gone home is probable 



pure categorical propositions 

 

quality 

every categorical proposition possesses quality 
by the quality of a proposition is meant its power of 
expressing an afisrmative or a negative judgment 

gold is a metal — affirmative 
salt is not a metal — negative 

the negation in propositions is expressed variously 
sometimes by the negative particle as above and 
sometimes by no neither not any etc as 

no fools are admired 

if the negative particle affects only the predicate 
the proposition may be treated as affirmative as 

sub cop fred 

these men are no fools 

 

quantity 

every proposition has quanhty by the quantity 
of a proposition is meant the power it has of affirming 
something of the whole or of only some part of the 

b 



 

subject a proposition which affirms something 
respecting the whole extent of the subject is called 
universal as 

all men are mortal 

a proposition which affirms something respecting a 
part only of the subject is called particular as 

some men are wise 

thus the quantity of a proposition depends upon 
whether the subject is taken in the whole of its exten 
sion or only a part of it 

a the following subjects are considered as taken 
universally that is in technical language as being 
distributed 

 singular terms as john is happy 

 terms with some adjective prefixed whether 
affirmative or negative which denotes universality as 
all every no not any etc — as 

ail men or every man i i mortal 

no man or not any man is to be despised 

 indefinite terms so used as to imph universality 

as bees are wise insects 

b the following subjects are considered as taken in 
a particular sense t e as being undistributed 

 terms with an adjective prefixed tliat denotes 
particularity — 

some men are wise 

 indefinite terms so used as to imply a particular 
rather than a universal signification — 

cherries are ripe 

the way in which the quantity of indefinite terms is decided 
 by considering the matter of the proposition itself when the 
tmth expressed implies necessity or universality an indefinite 
term is taken in its whole extension when a mere contingent 
truth is expressed an indefinite term is to be regarded as parti 
cular it u universally true for example that bees are wise 



 

insects but only contingently so that cherries are ripe hence 
 bees is regarded as a uniyersal term cherries as a parti 
cular one 



 
quantity of the predicate 

the quantity of a proposition taken as a whole 
depends upon the subject being either universal or 
particular as the case may be but it is equally im 
portant for us to consider the quantity of the predicate 
since there are various important conclusions de 
pending upon it 

the general rule for the extension of the predicate 
is that in all affirmative propositions it must be 
regarded as particular while in all negative propo 
sitions it is universal 

the reason of this will be evident when we consider 
that all we assert in an affirmative proposition is that 
the predicate includes the subject thus in the pro 
position 

all stones are minerals 

we only employ the word minerals in so far as it coin 
cides with the word stones that is only in a part of 
its extension 

on the other hand in a negative proposition we 
assert that no part of the subject is contained in any 
part of the predicate thus when i say 

no stones are metals 

i exclude the notion stones from the entire extension 
of the word metals and consequently use it in its 
whole generality 

if the quantity of the predicate were properly expressed ie 
the exact extent in which tlie term is employed in each case 
clearly noted it woald add much to the simplification of all the 
succeeding logical forms whether in the conversion of proposi 
tions or in the mechanism of the syllogism as this idea how 



 

ever first proposed by sir w hamilton has not yet been gene 
rally adopted we shall present the syllogism in the usual 
manner merely indicating where simplifications might be made 
by means of the quantification of the predicate 



 



we have now explained — of what parts every 
proposition consists viz of a subject predicate and 
copula we have shown how propositions may be 
classified in reference to their substance in re 
gard to simple categorical propositions we have 
pointed out what is meant by their quality and their 
quantity and we have shown last of all how to 
determine the quantity of the predicate 

for convenience saie logicians have agreed to re 
present propositions in reference to their quality and 
quantity by the four vowels a e i thus as 
there are two kinds of quality and two of quantity the 
four kinds of proposition resulting from their combi 
nation are as follows 

 universal affirmative a 

 universal negative e 

 particular affirmativei 

 particular negative 

we have next to show when any given proposition 
is presented to us what other propositions may be cor 
rectly and logically drawn from it 

let us take as an example the oftrepeated pro 
position 

all men are mortal 

what can we at once conclude from this i c what 
other propositions can we affirm as included in it 

first then if we know that all men are mortal we 
can positively affirm the less general truth some 
men are mortal this conclusion of a particular 
truth from a universal is termed subaltemation 



 

secondly hj transposing the terms we can also 
affirm that some mortals are men this is termed 
conversion 

thirdly by turning the affirmative into a negative 
we can again predicate that no men are not mortal 
this is termed opposition we must next explain 
therefore the laws of subalternation of conversion 
and of opposition 



 

subalternation 

by subalternation we mean the conclusion of a par 
ticular truth from a universal the correctness of the 
conclusion depends upon the relation which a logical 
whole bears to its parts if the whole includes the 
parts then what is true of the whole must be true of 
each part taken separately the universal truth is 
called the subalternans and the particular one deduced 
from it the subalterna the two rules of subalter 
nation then are as follows 

 from the truth of the subalternans follows ne 
cessarily the truth of the subalterna 

all men are mortal — subalternans 
 some men are mortal — subalterna 

 from the truth of the subalterna nothing can be 
concluded respecting the truth of the subalternans 
from the proposition some birds are rapacious you 
cannot conclude anything whatever respecting all birds 



 

conversion 

to convert a proposition means to transpose the 
terms and thus draw another proposition from it of 
the same quality 



 

in some propositions this is very readily accom 
plished a simple transposition of the terms being all 
that is necessary to do so 

thus from the proposition no stones are metals it 
follows at once that no metals are stones so also it 
follows from the proposition some birds are rapacious 
that some rapacious things are birds 

but a simple transformation will not always hold 
good thus we cannot conclude from the proposition 
all metals are minerals that all minerals are metals 
nor from the proposition some minerals are not stones 
that some stones are not minerals 

from the above instances we see that the two kinds 
of propositions in which a simple transposition can take 
place are a universal negative e and a particular 
affirmative i and the reason of this is plain — for as 
in e both subject and predicate are distributed there 
is no change made in the extension of either term by 
a simple transposition of them so also as in i both 
terms are undistributed they are both taken exactly in 
the same extension when converted 

on the contrary if we take a universal affirmative 
a such as all metals are minerals here the subject is 
universal and the predicate particular § but if we 
transpose the terms immediately the predicate which 
wa particular becomes universal and the subject 
which was universal becomes particular so that 
any conclusion thus drawn would violate the rules of 
subalternation § to convert a proposition a 
therefore we must not only transpse the terms but 
limit the quantity and conclude another proposition 
in i thus from the proposition all metals are 
minerals you can simply conclude by transposition 
that some minerals are metals this is called conversio 
per accidens or otherwise conversion by limitation 

but then what are we to do with o which can be 
converted in neither of these two ways the simplest 
method is to attach the negative to the predicate 



 

then becomes i and can be simply converted 
thus from — 

sub cop pred 

some minerals are not stones 

it follows that some things that are not stones are mi 
nerals this is termed conversion by negation 

as a proposition in e can be converted by limitatioti 
as well as simply and a proposition in a can be con 
verted by negation as well as by limitation the whole 
of the possible methods of conversion may be thus 
summed up — 

e i are converted simply 

a e are converted by limitation 

a o are converted by negation 

if the exact qaantity of the predicate were expressed in each 
case then every proposition might be simply converted for then 
each term being affirmed of every other in a precise sense the 
simple transposition would take place without violating any of 
the rales of subaltemation 



 
opposition 

by opposition we mean the difference in quality be 
tween propositions which have the same subject and 
predicate take the two following opposites — 

all stones are minerals 
some stones are not minerals 

now here there is a positive contradiction of such 
a nature that if one of the propositions be true the 
other milst be false hence if you know the truth of 
either of these propositions you can at once conclude 
on the falsity of the other — an inference which directly 
follows from the laws of subaltemation 

again if i affirm as true no stones are metals it 
is equally certain that the proposition some stones 



 

are metals is false and for the same reason as that 
above stated 

in these two cases it will be seen there is a com 
plete opposition not only in quality but also in quart 
tuy between the two propositions in question hence 
they are calledc ontradictories contradictories then 
are so related that one of them must be false and the 
other true this may be exemplified in the following 
couple — 

all men are good 
some men are not good 

where we see by a moments reflection that we have 
one false proposition and one true one logic has 
nothing to do with determining which one is false and 
which true it merely decides their relation to each 
other 
but again take the following two propositions — 

all stones are minerals 
no stones are minerals 

now of these two propositions you may immediately 
conclude as before the falsity of one from the known 
truth of the other but it may also happen that both 
of them are false which will certainly be the case if 
the predicate happens only partially to agree with the 
subject as in the following couple — 

all men are good — false 
no men are good — false 

opposition then between two universal affirmative 
propositions is called contrariety and the two pro 
positions are called contraries to each other 

once more take the two following propositions — 

some stones are minerals 
some stones are not minerals 

now both of these propositions may be true but they 
cannot possibly both be false it may easily be the 



 

case however that the one is true and the other false 
opposition between two propositions such as these ie 
between two particular affirmations is called subcon 
trariety and the propositions themselves are called 
suhcontraries 

the laws of opposition then maj now be summed 
up in few words opposition can take place in three 
ways — 

 between two universal propositions 

 between two particular propositions 

 between two propositions the one of which is 
universal and the other particular 

the first are called contraries 

the second are called subcontraries 

the third are called contradictories 

in the first both may be false but both cannot be 
true and if one is true the other mtist be false 

in the second both may be true but both cannot 
be false but if the one is false the other must be 
true 

in the third one must be false and then the other 
must be true 

with regard to the question which of the propo 
sitions is true and which false in each instance this 
of course depends upon the matter whether it be 
necessary or impossible or contingent in necessary 
matter the affirmative will always be true and the 
negative false in impossible matter the negative will 
always be true and the affirmative false while in 
contingent matter the particular will always be true 
and the universal false 

opposition between two singulars is reckoned as contradiction 
not contrariety because they absolutely exclude each other 

the following scheme conveys to the eye the whole 
of the principles of opposition — n i c meaning 



 



respectively necessary impossible and contingen 
matter and t and f meaning true and false thei 
n t will mean in necessary matter true i f ii 
impossible matter false etc

compound propositions 

we have shown the most important points to be 
noted respecting simple categorical propositions it 
only remains under this division of the subject to ex 
plain briefly the varieties of the compound proposition 

 the copulative proposition is that in which the 
parts are joined by the copulative particle and 
as — 

england and france are in europe 

here for the proposition to be true au the parts 
must be true 



 

 the disjunctive proposition is that in which the 
parts are united by the disjunctive particle or 
as — 

john or marj is to blame 

here for the proposition to be true only one of the 
parts need be correct 

 the adversative proposition is that in which the 
parts are related by an adversative particle such as 
 though or although — 

though cicero was a roman he was also a 
philosopher 

 the hypothetical proposition is that in which 
the parts are united by some conditional particle such 
as if— 

j£ animals think they have souls 

while a term simply answers to a generalised idea a proposi 
hon answers to a complete thought in which there is a perceived 
relation between two ideas of a different degree of generality 
the copula simply expresses this relationship thus if i say 
 coal is black all that i mean logically is that the cluster of 
other qualities forming the phenomenon coal is always asso 
ciated with the one quality black so if i say coal is a 
mineral all i mean logically is that the qualities peculiar to 
coal are only found in connexion with the general qualities which 
make up the concept mineral thus every logical proposition 
is a species of equation having qualities for the terms employed 
and all logical statements may be thus shown to admit of an 
algebraical form — vide boole investigation of the laws 
thought 



 



m on reasoning 
 

in explaining the nature of subalternation conver 
sion and opposition we showed how from a given 
proposition a number of other propositions might be 
correctly drawn in these cases however the new 
propositions did not contain any new truth they were 
simply different ways of arranging the very same terms 
so as to present the contained truth in a variety of 
different forms 

in reasoning however we deduce from two or more 
given propositions a new truth which is not directly 
contained in either of them 

when reasoning is stated in a purely logical form 
it is termed a syllogism our object therefore in 
the present division of the subject will be to explain 
the nature of syllogisms — their mechanism and their 
laws 

the following is a syllogism in regular form — 

all philosophers are studious 
caius is a philosopher 
caius is studious 

let us see of what it consists 

proximately it consists of three propositions the 
two first are called the premises and the last is called 
the conclusion 

if we look more closely into each of these propo 
sitions we shall find that they are altogether made up 
of three terms the question which has to be dis 
cussed and the conclusion we desire to draw is the 
fact contained in the last of the three propositions 
viz caius is studious in this proposition as in all 
sy the subject is necessarily less extensive than the 




 

predicate hence the predicate of the conclusion has 
been named the major term and the suhject of the 
conclusion the minor term this is invariahlj the case 
in all regular syllogisms 

now to compare the two terms caius and stttdious 
and prove their congruity we select a third term 
which we know to be related to both so that by 
showing the agreement of the major and minor with 
this third or middle terra we can determine their 
agreement with each other 

the process is in form similar to that by which we 
ascertain any two objects at a distance to be of the 
same length as we cannot compare one with the 
other directly we compare them both with some com 
mon standard and by means of their relation to it 
conclude upon their relations to each other 

in making this comparison in the above syllogism 
we first take the major term studious and compare it 
with the middle term philosophers thus — 

all philosophers are studious 

this is called the major premiss because it is that 
which contains the major term 

next we take the minor term caius and compare 
it also with the middle term thus — 

caius is a philosopher 

this is called the minor premiss as containing the 
minor term then from the two — 

all philosophers are studious and 
caius is a philosopher 

we deduce — 

caius is studious 

which is the conclusion 



 



 



 
conclusiveness of syllogism 

let us now see on what the conclusiveness of the 
syllogism t e the ms consequentitb depends the 
whole theory is founded upon the relation of a logical 
whole to its parts consequently it springs primarily 
out of the very nature of the concept as a valid act of 
generalisation the relation of a logical whole to its 
parts is such that whatever can he afllrmed or denied 
of a genusy can also be affirmed or denied of all the 
species or individuals included in it 

now in every syllogism there is something affirmed 
or denied of a genus in the major premiss the 
major premiss accordingly really involves the con 
clusion only in too disguised a manner frequently 
to be at first seen the truth eg that all philosophers 
are studious involves the truth that caius is studious 
only it has to be shown that caius is really a philo 
sopher to make that conclusion self apparent 

the major premiss then states the general truths 
upon the knowlee of which the whole argument is 
based— the minor premiss next draws the subject of 
the conclusion into the scope of this general assertion 
by showing that it is a species under the very genus 
respecting which the first affirmation was made this 
being done the conclusion follows that the species or 
individual caius must also agree with that same 
term studwtes with whieh the genus it has been 
shown to belong to viz philosophers also agrees 
this is the principle expressed by the celebrated axiom 
of aristotle generally called the dictum de omni et 
nullo which may be thus expressed — that what 
ever is prediceued of a term in its full extension 



 

whether affirmatively or negatively may in like man 
ner he predicated of every thing contained under it 

 
general laws of the syllogism 

we have explained what the nature of a syllogism 
is and on what general axiom its validity is hased 
the principal things to he kept in mind are — first 
that in every syllogism there are three termsf the 
major the minor and the middle term of these the 
major has the greatest extension the minor the least 
while the middle term has an extension hetween the 
two hence the major and minor terms are some 
times called the extremes secondly that in every 
syllogism there are also three propositions the major 
premiss comparing the major and the middle term 
the minor premiss comparing the minor and the middle 
terms and the conclusion comparing the extremes 
the whole object of the syllogism is to compare these 
extremes with each other by means of their mutual 
relation to a third term 

in the syllogism which we have already adduced 
all the three propositions are universal affirmatives 
a a a such however need not be the case all 
four kinds of propositions affirmative and negative 
universal and particular may take their place in a 
regular syllogism as in the following — 

e — xo stones are metals 
a — all flints are stones 
ve — no flints are metals 

and again — 

a — all stones are minerals 
l — some marbles are stones 
••i — some marbles are minerals 

now there are certain rules which apply to all syl 
logisms the violation of any one of which would pro 

c 



 

duce an illegitimate and false conclusion these rules 
are easily reduced to six three respecting quantity 
two respecting quality and one respecting both 

rule t — the middle term must be once distributed 
ie taken in its whole extension were this not the 
case there would be no fixed standard of comparison 
between the extremes — since one of them might agree 
with one part of the middle term and the other with 
another part so that in fact there would be two middle 
terms employed thus from the following premises no 
conclusion could be drawn — 

some philosophers are studious 
caius is a philosopher 

for the philosophers that are studious and the 
philosophers to which caius belongs might be two 
difiterent species and have no relation to each other in 
respect of studiousness 

rule il — neither of the extremes must be taken 
more universally in the conclusion than they are in 
the premises for if they are we draw a broader in 
ference than the premises warrant take the following 
example i — 

many animals chew the cud 
men do not chew the cud 
vmen are not animals 

here animals is taken only in part of its ex 
tension in the major premiss and in the whole of its 
extension in the conclusion § we have there 
fore an illicit process of the major if it were true 
to say all animals chew the cud then the conclusion 
would be justified 

rule iii — if both premises be particular no con 
clusion whatever can be drawn for in this case 
either the middle term will be undistributed or there 
will be an illicit process similar to that given under 
the last rule 



 

rule iv— if both premises be affirmative the con 
clusion must be so too selfevident 

rule v — if both premises be negative no con 
clusion whatever can be drawn for in this case the 
middle term is shown to disagree with both the major 
and the minor so that it cannot serve as any standard 
of comparison between them 

rule vi — the conclusion always follows the weaker 
part that is if one of the premises be particular 
the conclusion must be particular and if one of the 
premises be negative the conclusion must be negative 
also the first arises from the laws of subalternation 
which does not allow us to conclude any thing respect 
ing a whole genus from what is true of a species 
ihe second arises from the fact that agreement can 
not be inferred from disagreement 

 
of moods 

it has been already shown that all the four kinds 
of propositions viz a e i o may enter into a cor 
rect syllogism it does not follow from this that 
an combination of them will suffice to form an 
argument valid in form many combinations we 
see at once would violate several of the general rules 
laid down in the last paragraph — such as a £ a 
a i e cc now the combinations which a syllo 
gism can take in relation to the quantity and quality 
of its three propositions are called moods and it is 
important to determine both how many moods are 
possible and how many are valid 

with regard to the possible number of moods this 
is a mere question of arithmetic there are four 
kinds of propositions a e i o and three proposi 
tions in each syllogism now any one of these four 
kinds of propositions may be in the major premiss and 
any one of them also in the minor this will give x 

 



 

or different forms for the two premises but each 
of these premises may have any one of the four 
kinds of proposition for a conclusion — consequently 
the possible combinations of them in the syllogism 
are in number x or 

now of these possible combinations no less than 
 are excluded for will be found to violate the 
rd and the th of the general rules violate the 
th rule violate the fourth and one is useless as 
giving a particular conclusion when a general one is 
admissible eleven moods therefore remain as valid 
for framing a legitimate syllogism these are aaa 
aaiaee aeo all aoo eae 
eao eioj lai o a o 

 
of figure 

it has been already shown that the middle term 
appears both in the major and minor premiss of a 
syllogism it is not necessary however that it should 
always hold the same place there 

in most of the syllogisms which we have already 
cited the middle term stands as the subject of the 
major and the predicate of the minor premiss but it 
may be also the subject of both or the predicate of 
both or the predicate of the major and the subject of 
the minor now these four different positions which 
the middle term can take in the premises of a syllo 
gism give rise to what are called the figures 

in the st figure the middle term is the subject of 
the major and the predicate of the minor 

all stones are minerals 
marble is stone 
• marble is a mineral 

in the second figure the middle term is the predi 
cate of both premises 



 

no good man delights in hurting the feelings of 

others 
libellers delight in hurting the feelings of others 
vno good man is a libeller 

in the third figure the middle term is the subject 
of both premises — 

all true penitents will find meroy 
some true penitents have been great sinners 
v some who will find mercy have been great sinners 

in the fourth figure the middle term is the predicate 
of the major and the subject of the minor — 

all stones are minerals 
no minerals are organised 
no stones are organised 

 

 of mood and figure combined 

we have before seen that there are moods which 
do not violate any of the general laws of the syllogism 
of these moods there are which will hold good 
in each figure taking then mood and figure to 
gether there are conclusive forms of the syllogism 
several of these however are useless as giving us a 
paiticular conclusion where a universal one is equally 
legitimate so that the one is really involved in the 
other leaving out therefore the useless moods wo 
find that there are which can staitd in the first 
figure viz aaaeaeaii and e i 
that there are which can stand in the second figure 
viz e a e a e e e i and a that 
there are which can stand in the third figure viz 
aai lai all e ao oaoandeio 
and that there are which can stand in the fourth 
figure viz a a i a e e i a i e a and 
£ i — nineteen available moods in all 



 

to aid the memory of the student these moods have 
been combined into the following hexameter lines 
fig barbara celarent darii ferioque prions 
fig cesare camestres festino haroko secundse 
p q ftertia darapti disamis datisi felapton 

® bokardofferison habet quarta insuper addit 
fig bramantipy camenes dimaris fesapo fre 

sison 
in these lines the three vowels in each of the words 
printed in italics give the moods of each figure 
adopting therefore this phraseology we can speak of 
a syllogism being drawn in barbara in camestres 
c the very mention of which words determines at 
once the mood and tlie figure when the five hexameters 
have once been committed to memory 

 

special rules of the figures 

as each of the four figures places an argument in a 
particular form determined by the position of the 
middle term in the premises so each is subject to 
certain special rules in addition to the six general 
rules before explained 

special rules op the pmst pigure 

 the major must be universal 

 the minor must be affirmative 

for if the minor is negative the major must be 
affirmative rule and the conclusion negative rule 
 then the conclusion being negative the major 
term would of necessity be taken universally in the 
conclmion § whereas it could only be taken 
particularly in the major premiss as being the predi 
cate of an affirmative proposition so that rule would 
be violated also the major must be universal or else 
the middle term being particular in the minor would 
not be once distributed and rule would be violated 



 



special rules of the second figure 

 the major must be universal 

 the conclusion must be negative 

for in the second figure the middle term is the pre 
dicate of both premises hence one of them must be 
negative or the middle term would not be taken once 
universally and consequently the conclusion must be 
negative also the major must be universal othervise 
the major term being taken universally in the conclu 
sion as being the predicate of a negative proposition 
would only be taken particularly in the premises 
violation of rule 

special rules op the third figure 

 the minor must be affirmative 

 the conclusion must be particular 

in the third figure the middle term is the subject of 
both premises now if the minor were negative the 
major would have to be affirmative and consequently 
tlie major term would be particular whereas the con 
clusion being negative it would be there taken univer 
sally violation of rule 

the conclusion must also be particular because one 
of the extremes at least must be particular where they 
are both the predicates of the two premises were 
til is not the case both premises would be negative and 
no conclusion whatever could be drawn 

special rules of the fourth figure 

the special rules of the fourth figure are merely 
hypothetical namely if the major is affirmative 
the minor must be universal if the minor is af 
firmative the conclusion must be particular if 
either premiss be negative the major must be universal 

as the fourth figure is an awkward and in fact use 
less form of syllogistic reasoning we need not dwell 
upon these special rules any farther than merely men 



 

tioning them the student hy a little thought can 
easily verify them for himself 

the first second and third figures have all certain 
advantages according to the kind of argumentation we 
are desirous of carrying on 

the first figure is in form by far the most perfect 
all syllogistic reasoning be it observed proceeds upon 
the subordination of a part to a whole ue on the 
dictum that what is true of the genus is true of all the 
species under it the syllogism therefore should be so 
framed as to show this subordination through the in 
tervention of the middle term in the clearest possible 
way tliis is accomplished only in the first figure 
where everything proceeds regularly according to the 
dictum de omni et nullo — 

all men are mortal 
john is a man 
john is mortal 

the second figure having always a negative con 
clusion is well adapted for disproving something that 
has been affirmed by an opponent — 

none who despise charity are truly virtuous 
bigots despise charity 
bigots are not truly virtuous 

the third figure is a convenient form in which to 
establish a particular objection to some sweeping affir 
mation — 

every animal has feeling 
some animals are men 
some men have feeling 

the fourth figure should never be employed at all 

 

reduction 

the first figure being much more perfect in form 
than the rest logicians have invented methods by 



 

which all the moods of the other three figures may be 
reduced to this the process by which this is effected 
is called reduction 

the whole art of reduction depends on the laws of 
conversion § 

sometimes we need only to convert simply one of 
the premises and the syllogism at once takes the form 
of the first figure 

thus let the syllogism be cesar e — 

no mineral is organised 
all plants are organised 
no plants are minerals 

convert the major simply and we have — 

no organised being is a mineral 
all plants are organised beings 
vno plants are minerals 

which is a syllogism in celarent of the first figure 

sometimes again the premises must be transposed 
as well as converted 

thus let the syllogism be camestres — 

every plant is organised 
no mineral is organised 
no mineral is a plant 

here by converting the minor and then transposing 
the premises we have — 

no organised being is a mineral 
every plant is organised 
vno plant is a mineral 

which is a syllogism in celarent of the first figure 
and we only need to convert the conclusion to get the 
very same truth as was expressed in the conclusion of 
the first syllogism 

when reduction takes place simply by means of con 
version and transposition it is called ostensive 

there is another mode of reduction which is called 
reductio ad impossibile 



 

the process is as follows if the conclusion be false 
then the contradictory of it will be true take the 
contradictory and put it in the place of the minor pre 
miss in this way we shall have a conclusion which is 
the contradictory of the original minor but that 
original minor was true by hypothesis therefore the 
contradictory of it is false if the conclusion then be 
false one of the premises must be so and this can be 
none other than the new minor ie the contradictory 
of the original conclusion hence the original con 
clusion is true 

this is the mode of reasoning commonly known as 
a reductio ad absurdum 

let us take an instance in baroko — 

all plants are organised 
some productions of nature are not organised 
 some productions of nature are not plants 

now if the conclusion be false its contradictory is 
true viz all productions of nature are plants assume 
the truth of this and put it in the place of the minor 
premiss then we have a syllogism in barbara — 

all plants are organised 
all productions of nature are plants 
v all productions of nature are organised 

now this conclusion contradicts the original minora 
which is true by hypothesis it must consequently be 
false a falsity therefore must lie in one of the pre 
mises and that the minor for the original major is 
true by hypothesis but the new minor is the con 
tradictory of the original conclusion so that if it be 
false the original conclusion must be true § 

the four mnemonic lines above quoted are so formed 
as to show not only what moods are conclusive in each 
figure but how the moods of the second third and 
fourth figure may be reduced to the first 

the four initial consonants b c d f show to which 



 

mood of the first figure each of the others may be 
reduced each one namely may be reduced to that 
mood of the first figure which begins with the same 
letter 

moreover the other consonants show how that re 
duction is to be effected 

thus s means that the proposition immediately pre 
ceding it must be simply converted p that it must be 
converted per accidens and m that the propositions 
between which it stands are to be transposed lastly 
k shows that we must employ the reductio ad impos 
sibile and that the proposition immediately preceding 
it must be left out and the contradictory of the con 
clusion assumed in its place 

thus in dimaris the initial d shows that it can be 
converted to darii of the first figure m shows that 
the major and minor premises are to be transposed and 
s shows that the conclusion is to be simply converted 



note 

in the preceding sections we have explained the common 
doctrine respecting the four figures and the method of reducing 
all the moods of the last three figures to corresponding moods in 
the first it can hardly fail to strike any one on first looking 
over this system of logical forms that it is remarkably cumbrous 
in its structure and on that account by no means likely to be a 
perfect representation of our mental operations as all logical 
reasoning depends on showing the subordination of the pans to 
a logical whole by means of a middle term we should naturally 
look for some common symbol of reasoning in which this process 
is made apparent by the very form of the syllogism such a 
symbol as we before showed exists in the syllogisms of the first 
figure so that we ought to regard this as the true type of every 
deductive argument 

the real cause why such an extensive apparatus of moods and 
figures has been invented is to be found primarily in the inde 
finiteness which attaches to the quantity of the predicate in each 
of the premises just as the process of conversion is rendered 
uniform and simple by a duly expressed quantification of the pre 
dicate sec also wiu the whole apparatus of mood and 
figure be obviated by the same simple operation 

all the special laws of the four figures only hold oodvol l 



 

seqaence of the indefiniteness of the predicates quantify the 
predicates and these laws are shown at once to be false 
the special laws of the first figure are — 

 that the major be universal 

 that the minor be affirmative 

but in the following two syllogisms both these laws are set at 
nought 

some men are certain foolish people 

all rational beings are all men 

ssome rational beings are certain foolish people 

again 

all metals are certain minerals 

no stones are metals 

no stones are certain minerals 

in the first of these syllogisms the major is particular and 
in the second the minor is negative yet both are conclusive 
and both in the first figure 

in like manner the special rules of all the other figures may 
be shown unnecessary in fact if the syllogisms of the second 
third and fourth figures be properly arranged according to sub 
ordination of parts to a whole it will be found that they will all 
naturally fall into the form of the first figure 

take the following syllogism cesare of nd fig — 

no metals are stones 
all amethysts are stones 
 no amethysts are metals 

here there is no subordination of parts to a whole clearly 
shown but only one implied namely this no stones are metals 
but all amethysts are stones no amethysts are metals the 
first syllogism is therefore only an awkward and imperfect way 
of stating the last put the terms in the proper order of logical 
subordination and a regular syllogism of the st fig immediately 
becomes apparent 

this new analysis of the process of reasoning has been for 
many years adopted by sir w hamilton and may be found 
pretty fully expounded in mr t s baynes essay on the new 
analytic of logical forms 

the one universal canon of logical reasoning which renders 
the special rules of the figures nugatory and includes all the 
general ones in a single propositioiif is thus stated — 

 what worse relation of subject and predicate subsists be 
tween either of two terms and a common third term with which 
both are related — and one at least positively so — that relation 
subsists between the terms themselves

noncategorical syllogism 



 
irregular syllogisms 

we have now explained pretty fully the nature of the 
categorical syllogism we must next advert to those 
which are not couched in the purely categorical form 
noncategorical syllogisms may be divided into two 
classes irregular and hypothetical 

irregular syllogisms are those which present either a 
deficiency or a redundancy in their mode of statement 

 in common language we more generally than not 
employ an elliptical mode of reasoning — leaving some 
one or other of the premises to be supplied by the mind 
of the hearer for example nothing would be more 
natural than to make such a statement as this — john 
is successful because he is prudent the force of this 
reasoning of course depends on the generally acknow 
ledged sentiment that prudence is the road to success 
more commonly than not indeed we may suppress the 
major premiss in an ordinary argument because the 
mind at once supplies it as a generally received prin 
ciple a defective argument of this nature is called 
an enthymeme 

 a redundant syllogism is one in which there is 
some subordinate statement supplied to maintain one 
or other of the premises take the following — 

every thing known by direct intuition is true since 
upon direct intuition all knowledge and all 
reasoning is primarily based 

but our mental identity is known by direct intui 
tion 

•• our mental identity is true 

this is called an epicherema or an epicherematic 
syllogism the reasoning in an epicherema may 

d 



 

always be reduced to two or more simple syllogisms 
thus in the above case it could be so stated — 
that upon which all knowledge and reasoning is 

primarily based is true 
but all knowledge and reasoning is based upon 

direct intuition 
v every direct intuition is true 
again everything known by direct intuition is true 
our mental identity is known by direct intuition 
•• our mental identity is a truth 
here it will be seen the conclusion of the first syl 
logism is made a premiss of the next a string of 
syllogisms of this kind all aiming at one final conclu 
sion forms a sorites only to render the reasoninoc 
closer the intermediate conclusions are suppressed till 
we come to the end 

the english are a brave people 
a brave people are free 
a free people are happy 
• the english people are happy 

 

hypothetical syllogisms 

hypothetical syllogisms are of two kinds — h con 
ditional and disjunctive 

 a conditional syllogism is one which has a con 
ditional proposition for its major or for its minor or 
for both if both the premises are conditional the 
conclusion must be so too if however the major only 
is conditional it is termed conditional ex parte 

antecedent 

 

as — if napoleon was the scourge of europe 
consequent 



he deserved to be banished 

but he wds the scourge of europe 
•• he deserved to be banished 



 

in conditional syllogisms there are two modes of 
procedure 

 from the position of the antecedent to the posi 
tion of the consequent this is called the modus 
ponens or constructive mode because you affirm in the 
consequent the truth of what is stated conditionally in 
the antecedent and thus get an affirmative conclusion 
the syllogism above stated is an instance of this but 

 we may proceed from the remotion of the con 
sequent to the remotion of the antecedent this is 
called the modus tollens or destructive mode 

antecedent 



thus — if no bigot is a wise man 

consequent 



no bigot is worthy our notice 
but no bigot is a wise man 
•• no bigot is worthy our notice 
here from the negation of the consequent we con 
clude the negation of the antecedent and thus get a 
correct negative conclusion 

the illicit modes of reasoning are to proceed from 
the position of the consequent to the position of the 
antecedent or from the remotion of the antecedent to 
the remotion of the consequent 

st false procedure 
antecedent consequent 

if great philosophersbe virtuous they will be admired 
but great philosophers are admired 
v they are virtuous men 

nd false procedure 
antecedent 



t 

if catiline betrayed his fellow conspirators 

consequent 



he was a wicked man 

j 



 

but he did not betray his fellow conspirators 
• he was not a wicked man 

 

 a disjunctive syllogism is one which has for its 
major premiss a disjunctive proposition affirmative in 
quality 

here as in the conditional there are two legitimate 
ways of proceeding — 

 from the position of one of the parts to the re 
motion of all the rest or 

 from the remotion of all the rest of the parts to 
the position of some one of them — thus taking the 
disjunctive proposition — 

caius lives either in rome or naples or florence 
we may affirm one part viz 

that he lives in rome — 

and from this affirmation we negative all the rest — 

•• he lives neither in naples nor florence 

or we may deny all the parts but one 

he lives neither in naples nor florence 

and conclude that — 

he mves in rome 

there is yet another form of the disjunctive syllo 
gism viz that in which from the remotion of each of 
the parts the remotion of the whole is concluded 
thus cicero argues epicherematically respecting pain — 

if pain is to be feared it must be so either because 
it is long in duration or intense in degree — 

but it is not so when long in duration for then it 
cannot be severe nor when intense in deree for then 
it cannot last long 

 fain ia not to be feared at all 



 

 
dilemma 

the dilemma is a syllogism that partakes partly of 
a conditional and partly of a disjunctive character 

it is an argument such that when all the suppo 
sitions of a case are stated any one of them puts the 
opponent to inconvenience 

the most usual and the most legitimate form of it 
however is — when there are only two suppositions 
either of which being granted overthrows the position 
maintained by the opposing party hence the origin 
of the expression to fix a person on the horns of a 
dilemma 

thus we may state ciceros argument respecting the 
power of a wise man to endure pain in the following 
way — 

if pain is either short in duration or moderate in 
intensity a wise man can bear it 

but it is always either short in duration or moderate 
in intensity 

therefore a wise man can always bear it 

the validity of the dilemma as an argument rests 
fundamentally upon a correct enumeration of parts in 
the statement of the conditions 

thus if i were to argue — 

if a man be a christian he worships the true god 

if he be a heathen he worships an idol 

but he must be either a christian or a heathen 

therefore every man must worship either the true 
god or an idol 
there would evidently be an error in the enumeration 
of conditions some men might not be either chris 
tians or heathen they might be mohammedans or 
atheists 

in the same way as we have seen respecting condi 
tional syllogisms so the dilemma may be either con 

d 



 

structive or destructive it may be either simple 
having a categorical conclusion like the first of those 
above quoted or complex having a disjunctive con 
clusion like the secbnd 

jvbte 

the classification of noncategorical syllogisms may be 
presented in the following scheme — noncategorical syllogisms 
are 

l irrsgulab 

a enthymeme 
h epicherema 
a i sorites 

n hypothetical 

a conditipnal 
b disjanctive 
a dilemma 



 



iv om fallacies 

 

in discussing the nature and mechanism of the syl 
logism we have shown what kind of arguments are 
valid and what kind inconclusive as to their form 
sometimes however we meet with arguments which 
inform are perfectly correct but yet lead to a wrong 
conclusion it is these that we have now briefly to 
discuss under the head of fallacies 

most of the writers on logic divide the different 
kinds of fallacious reasoning into two classes viz 
fallacies in dietioncy and fallacies extra dictionem 
the first class as the name indicates includes all 
those cases where the fallacy lies in the expression 
the second class includes all those where the fallacy 
lies in the subject matter 

 
fallacies in the expression 

under fallacies in expression we designate all those 
cases of incorrect reasoning which arise from the am 
biguity of particular words or expressions we may 
divide them for convenience sake into five different 
classes which we shall briefly explain in order 

the first two species of this class of fallacies which 
may easily be explained together are the homo 
nymia and the amphibolia the former arises 
from one of the words which compose the middle term 
being in tve equivocal t e capable of more than one 
signification the latter from vi txi xxaivcww 



 

phrase rendered doubtful by its position or gram 
matical construction 

the instances in which particular terms assume an 
equivocal aspect are very numerous sometimes eg 
words having accidentally the same orm are totally 
different in meaning other terms again are not un 
frequently chosen to express technically some precise 
and restricted idea when in popular use they are em 
ployed in a more loose and general sense the one being 
termed the first the other the second intention si 
milar indefiniteness arises from the use of analogical 
and elliptical words all of which when employed as 
middle terms in a syllogism give rise to the logical 
error which we express by homonymia a single and 
glaring instance since principles are best seen in ex 
treme cases may suffice to exemplify this fallacy 
employing the equivocal use of the word christians 
the following syllogism might be formed from it — 

all christians are good men 
all englishmen are christians 
 all englishmen are good men 

the different forms of amphibolia are not less nu 
merous ambiguity e arising from the two dif 
ferent cases in which a word might be understood in 
the construction of a sentence is not unfrequently 
found in modern and far more frequently in the an 
cient languages of greece and rome the relative 
clause again may often be referred to two different 
antecedents and indeed any kind of subordinate clause 
is very often applicable to different parts of the whole 
passage in which it stands fallacies arising from 
such causes as these may be easily solved by showing 
that in every case the syllogism has really two middle 
terms and that there is therefore no standard of com 
parison by which the agreement of the major and the 
minor may be tried 

the two next sophisms in dictione are those 



 

called the fallacies of composition and division these 
sophisms which are the most important of their class 
arise from employing the middle term once distribu 
tively and once collectively and thus destroying the 
standard of comparison in the former case t e 
in the fallacy of composition something is established 
of the separate individuals in a class and then in 
ferred of that class taken collectively this may be 
familiarly illustrated by the wellknown fable of the 
father who to impress upon his sons the importance of 
union and harmony aniongst themselves showed them 
that each separate stick of a bundle might be easily 
broken while the whole together were irresistibly firm 
the fallacy of composition would have led them to the 
conclusion that if all the rods were fragile taken se 
parately they would be equally so when bound toge 
ther the fallacy of division is the reverse of this 
and to take the same illustration it would have led to 
the conclusion that if the bundle above mentioned 
were incapable of being broken when taken collec 
tively the separate rods would present the same re 
sistance to our physical efforts this latter sophism 
frequently arises from the ambiguous use of the word 
all which may be taken both distributively and 
collectively as in the following syllogism 

all the angles of a triangle are equal to two right 
angles 

a b c is the angle of a triangle 

•• a b c is equal to two right angles 

these cases may easily be solved by enquiring in 
the outset in what precise sense the word • all is to 
be employed 

the logical fallacy in these two sophisms is spe 
cifically the same as in the last two arising that is 
from the ambiguity of the middle term the middle 
term it will be seen is taken distributively in the 
major and collectively in the minor when we err by 
composition while the case is precisely reversed when 



 

we err by division in both cases therefore two 
middle terms are involved which vary essentially in 
their meaning 

the th and last kind of sophism in this division 
is that termed — fallacia figurse dictionis 

the most common form in which this fallacy pre 
sents itself is in the case of paronymoui words in 
which two terms of the same root and closely con 
nected with each other etymologically are employed 
as though on that account identical in meaning when 
through conventional use their actual meaning has 
become considerably modified the following syl 
logism is an example of this error 

none but immortal beings will live for ever 
but all men are mortal 
vno men will live for ever 

here through conventional usae the word tm 
mortal is applied to the soul and mortal to the 
body so that the words not being really opposed 
cannot be substituted for each other as in the above 
syllogism other instances of the fallacia figurie 
dictionis occur from the use of a word first in its 
etymological and then in its popular sense or from 
employing a grammatical termination so as to render 
the real meaning of the sentence ambiguous to these 
some logicians add sophisms which arise from em 
ploying figurative language and reasoning upon it as 
if it were real but these may perhaps he better 
classified as instances of false parallels which we shall 
mention under the next division 

viewing this general division as a whole it is evi 
dent that all the cases might be reduced to the head 
of ambiguity f since it is in an ambiguity of one form 
or other that the error in every instance consists 
or to render the generalization rather more definite 
and distinctive we might form them into two classes 
one in which the ambiguity anaes tom li vaord and 



 

the other from the phrase and thus by an extension 
of the first two species include under them the re 
maining three 

 

fallacies in the matter 

we proceed next to the fallacies extra dichonem 
or fallacies in the thought itself a class far more fre 
quently to be met with and by no means so easy in 
the majority of instances to be detected 

these will fall according to aristotles arrange 
ment under seven heads which we shall take up 
successively in order at once to explain their nature 
and the various forms under which they are found 

l the first of these is the fallacia accidentis 
in forming a class out of individuals we always have 
some particular point or points of resemblance by 
virtue of which we unite them these individuals 
however may still have many points of dissimilarity 
which do not affect the classification and which are 
usually called accidents now we often afiirm of a 
class of things generally something that is only true of 
it accidentally and reasoning upon this affirmation 
arrive very soon at a false conclusion thus it is 
generally true that lions are fierce animals but we 
cannot conclude from this that lions which have been 
under a particular course of training are so this is 
an accident which modifies the general conditions of 
the case it is by a fallacy of this kind that all the 
errors and weaknesses of a party are often attributed 
to an individual simply because he happens to belong 
to it in all such instances we have the old fallacy of a 
twofold middle term and need only point out the 
ambiguity which arises from using it in one instance 
particularly and then universally thus destroying the 
uniformity of the standard by which the extremes are 
to be tested in order to solve the case 
 the next fallacy is tliat ot totxi 



 

secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter which is in 
fact only the reverse of the fallacia accidentis and 
is resolved on precisely the same principle the 
error here lies in reasoning not as hefore from the 
absolute to the conditional but from the conditional to 
the absolute or in other words in inferring that to be 
truly predicated of a subject when viewed dhsoliuely 
which is true of it only upon the supposition of some 
modifying conditions 

thus were i to argue that because arsenic is not 
unfrequently used in medicine to preserve health it is 
not destructive of human life i should be inferring a 
general conclusion of arsenic taken in its whole essence 
from a particular case in which the essential qualities 
of the poison are modified by other accidental additions 
here as before the error lies in there being really 
four terms to the syllogism thus if i were to argue 
that because the natives of europe are white men a 
hottentot born in europe must be white also i should 
be taking the middle term native of europe in two 
different senses one meaning the natural inhabitants 
of this quarter of the globe the other including any 
one who might accidentally be born in it 

 we come next to a very important sophism 
termed ignoratio elenchi the error in this is of a 
nature entirely different from any other we have before 
noticed the syllogism may be in itself correct the 
conclusion following properly from sound premises 
while yet that conclusion is not applicable to the real 
point in question 

an elenchus is properly a syllogism the conclusion 
of which is the contradictory to the conclusion of 
another which it is our intention to refute and it is 
evident that if the point established be not contra 
dictory to the one we are opposing they may be both 
true or both false without materially interfering with 
each other 
sometimes an argument ia stated vaawtslvj and 



 

then triumphantly refuted which is popularly called— i 
setting up a man of straw and then knocking him 
down sometimes the very point in question is m 
iaken and then disproved — a case exceedingly common 
in almost every kind of moral argumentation ano 
ther instance oiignoratio elenchi is when an argument 
is drawn from a case supposed parallel hut not really 
 as when berkeley proves the possibility of there 
being an invisible agency at work in the creation from 
the existence of animal spirits which he takes for 
granted to be actual though invisible realities errors 
arising from the use of figurative terms as though 
they were literally true may be ranged likewise under 
this head 

the last kind of this species of fallacy is that of 
imputing consequences and then arguing from them to 
the detriment of our opponent in every case of 
ignoratio elenchi we must show what the real question 
is and point out when we have placed the conclusion 
of the elenchus by its side that the one does not 
logically contradict the other 

 the fourth species of fallacy is one which presents 
itself under a grest variety of forms and is perhaps 
more frequently than any other employed for purposes 
of false and deceptive reasoning namely the petitio 
principii or begging the question the essence of 
this fallacy lies in taking for granted the very thing to 
be proved or assuming some point which equally 
requires to be established by additional evilence in 
every argument it is required that there should be a 
middle term and that this should be something with 
which the extremes may be advantageously compared 
in order that we may estimate by it as a known 
standard their comparative agreement or disagree 
ment hence the middle term must be something 
better known than the extremes otherwise it can be 
of no utility as a test 

when therefore we take a iveaxui a ytqsivv 



 

is quite as little known and requires quite s much 
demonstration as the very point in question we are 
guilty of one form of the petitio principii a simuar 
fault is committed when the middle term though 
differently expressed is really identical with one of 
the terms of the question and this is peculiarly 
liable to take place in a language which like our 
own is compounded of the radical parts of two or 
three others so that we can readily express the same 
idea by employing totally different phrases we may 
include indeed under the petitio principii all instances 
in which either of the premises in an argument are 
insufficiently supported and consequently unduly as 
sumed the sophistry involved in such reasoning is 
often by no means easy to detect especially when it 
occurs in the enthymematic form and the suppressed 
premiss is the very point in which the fallacy lurks 
a remarkable modification of this fallacy is that termed 
reasoning in a circle i e when two propositions are 
made mutually to prove each other each being one 
of the premises from which the other is deduced this 
error is often committed by christian apologists who 
prove the truth of the bible from the doctrines it con 
tains and then prove the truth of the doctrines from 
their being in the bible 

 the fifth species of fallacy is that termed the 
non causa pro caull which like the last presents itself 
under several modifications in some instances a 
cause is assumed which has no title to be called a vera 
causa at all i e which has no real observed or de 
monstrated existence such is the case when men 
amuse themselves with framing hypotheses upon slen 
der grounds and then reduce to them as general 
principles or laws observed facts in the operations of 
nature 

another form of this fallacy is that termed non talis 

causa pro tali or assigning a cause which is insufficient 

to account for the effect tudw i loatid may be 



 

classed the objections made against christianity from 
the feuds and animosities which have often accompanied 
it since it is totally unfitted to account for them with 
out the supposition of the other and more real causes 
existing in human nature a further case under this 
same head is that termed post hoc ergo propter 
hoc or supposing two things to be mutually cause and 
effect because they are respectively antecedent and 
consequent in time to each other the two former 
modes of this fallacy are evidently cases of petitio 
principii and may be shewn to be inconclusive from 
tlie gratuitous nature of the premises the last is a 
species of the fallacia accidentis and may be solved 
on the principle there pointed out 

 the sixth fallacy fallacia consequentis is the 
converse of the last there the antecedent was false 
here the consequent is so for example we may 
build an argument upon the converse of a propo 
sition which is not logically converted or violate in 
a similar manner the laws of opposition and illation 
and thus arrive at a conclusion far from being warranted 
by the premises the way in which this fallacy is to 
be solved is by pointing out the proper rules of con 
version etc which are violated and showing thus that 
the conclusion is not necessitated thus were a 
russian to argue that his country is far happier to live 
in than our own because there are fewer taxes to be 
piaid to the government we might show that a country 
without taxes is not opposed to an unhappy or a 
country with taxes to a happy one 

 the seventh and last sophism which we have to 
consider is that termed fallacia plurium interroga 
tionum in which a complex question is proposed in 
such a manner as to elicit if possible a simple or 
categorical answer if the sophist succeed in this on 
whatever side the answer may be returned he can 
employ it equally to silence his opponent this faxloa 
whether containing two or more awxiv ot v s 




 

more predicates maj be exposed hj pointing oat the 
separate parts of which the question consists and then 
giving a disjunctive answer 

thus were a sceptic to ask whether all such forms 
of religion as heathenism christianity iiohamme 
danism etc are not mere delusions of a superstitious 
mind we could not answer him catoricallj but 
should have to separate the subject of the question 
into its component parts and then answer each of 
iktm singly 

in viewing this second division of fallacies as a class 
one of two kinds of errors we observe occurs in every 
instance either the premises themselves are faulty or 
the cohciusiomy though deduced from correct premises 
is vicious or irrelevant to the question the great 
points therefore upon which we should keep our eye 
fbcd as thoce in which sophisms are most liable to 
lie concealed are first to see that the middle term is

conclusion is cmrrect and relevant to the subject in

a 

coclusion 

we have now given a brief sketch of the principal 
points usually included in the science of fonniil logic 
in doing so we have shown the nature of ahsiract 
idtas — their varieties and charwrteristics next we 
hftve dicsaedlileivpasalkmand pnnted out all the 
dftfemtt diange which it may nndergow and lastly 
v iat axhibtlad the laws of correct reasoning as 

kumdipoa te natiure of abstraction and geaerausatiool 

it ia mpogtmit thfl ei stndent should bear in mind 

otm whai proposed by this invesiigaliott some 



 

processes employed for the investigation of truth and 
expounds everi method by which we can arrive at a 
conclusion whatever grounds might be assigned for 
giving such an extension to the term logic taken 
alone yet assuredly there can be no reason for putting 
such an interpretation upon the term formal logic 
formal logic of which alone we have proposed to 
treat has a perfectly distinct field of its own it em 
braces simply the laws of generalisation the modes in 
which we express our judgments and the principles 
of accurate deduction 

it should always be kept in mind that there are 
two applications of the power of thinking essentially 
different from each other we may employ our 
reason either in investigating new truths or we may 
employ it in criticising what is already virtually 
known in arranging it into due order and in drawing 
particular inferences from the data actually before us 

now as to the apprehension of new truths there 
are many ways in which we arrive at them we may 
do so through the medium of the senses — that is by 
means of personal experience or we may do so by 
means of the testimony of others or we may do so by 
induction from facts presented to us either through 
experience or through testimony all these different 
methods of investigation form distinct objects of study 
we may lay down the canons of kxperience or 
arrange in order the laws of testimony or pursue 
the philosophy of induction each as a subject by it 
self these questions however have nothing directly 
to do with formal logic thei are all different 
methods of productive thought whereas logic is 
simply critical and analytic 

it has been not unfrequently taken up as an ob 
jection against the utility of the syllogism that it 
does not teach you to arrive at new truths but simply 
draws out into a definite conclusion what is already 
contained in the premises it mi k 



 

jected to grammar that it does not teach us new 
languages or help us to speak our own grammar 
teaches us the general laws of language and logic 
teaches us the general laws of thought the one as 
well as the other is a mental discipline that tends not 
to new discoveries but to clear the mind in the use 
of the knowledge it has already in its possession 

and this is an end assuredly which it is of the 
utmost importance to aim at the mere possession of 
a vast multiplicity of ideas — of facts — of experiences 
is by itself of comparatively little use to make 
them of use we need that degree of mental discipline 
which enables us to govern facts to harmonise them 
to combine them into a body of connected truth 

we do not promise accordingly from tlie study of 
logic to unfold any new fields of positive knowledge 
we do not pretend either to give any direct organum 
for the investigation of new truths but we do promise 
to afford some amount at least of that mental disci 
pline which shall give precision to the intellect a dis 
criminating power to the judgment and a facility for 
arranging and systematising our ideas those who 
think this of equally great importance with the accu 
mulation of the mere crude material of truth will not 
regret the time and the labour that is spent upon what 
is intended merely as a mental discipline
