preface 



i have called this book logic for the million by 
this title i meaa that here the art of beasoning is ex 
plained in such a way as to be readily understood even 
by those men and women who have not had the advantage 
of a literary education 

the imperfection of the existing works on logic as 
means of popular instruction is thus stated by mr 
blakey — 

 there seem to be two principal causes which render 
modem systems of logic both tiresome and comparatively 
useless juad these are first the employment of a vast 
number of the old scholastic terms and phrases derived 
fiom logicians of former times which throw over the art 
such an air of diflculty and perplexity that the reader 
before he has well entered upon the study of his subject 
is worn out by the mere pressure of imcouth words and is 
ad to make his retreat from such an irksome task with 
all possible expedition the second cause and one which 
is by r the most important is that our common books 
of logic may be said rather to treat of metaphysical systems 
than to unfold those rules precepts and suggestions which 
are instrumental in directing the judgment to right con 
clusions on the various important subjects with which it 
is necessary that man should be well acquainted the 
generality of the books here alluded to have been founded

upon the principle that before we could exercise our 
reasoning powers with energy and effect — before we could 
form right notions and give method and consistency to 
our conceptions — it was absolutely necessary that we 
should be expert metaphysicians ould be acquainted 
with all the mental speculations of the day and intimately 
and miliarly conversant with the anatomy and physiology 
of our own minds but this i apprehend is a radical 
error in our common treatises on logic 

the first cause refers to scholastic logic the second to 
metaphysical logic 

the advocates of the scholastic system of logic still 
contend for the use of a technical language it has been 
a great hindrance to popular education that as soon as 
any branch of knowledge is exalted into a science it is 
surroimded by a number of uncouth words the imder 
standing of which is more difficult than the imderstanding 
of the science the practice of using hard words to 
denote common things was ridiculed in butlers hudi 
bras with reference to the rhetoricians and the ridicule 
will apply with equal justice to the scholastic logicians — 

 for rhetoric he could not ope 
his mouth but out there flew a trope 
and when he happend to break off 
i the middle of his speech or cough 
he ahflrd words ready to show why 
and tell what rules he did it by 
else when with greatest art he spoke 
you d think he talkd like other folk 
for all the rhetoricians rules 
teach nothing but to name his tools 

metaphysical logic consists in the knowledge of the 
nature of those powers of the mind which are exercised in

the act of reasoning this subject is not discussed in the 
following pages it does not appear to me that this meta 
physical knowledge is at all necessary to the art of reason 
ing the analogy between the body and the mind seems 
to hold good in this case dancing is an act of the body 
reasoning is an act of the mind as it is not necessary 
to imderstand ike anatomy of the body in order to dance 
well so it is not necessary to understand the anatomy of 
the mind in order to reason well the study of meta 
physical science seems rather to teach the art of doubting 
than the art of reasoning by this kind of study berkeley 
was led to doubt the existence of matter and hume that 
of mind no man observes mr blakey appears more 
unfit for argumentative discussion on the common and 
everyday topics which engage the attention of men of the 
world than the profound thinker or the man of mental 
abstraction his power of mental analysis is too refined 
for objects of a formidable and gigantic nature and when 
he comes out into common life to measure his strength 
with the rustic minds aroimd him he too often finds to 
his great mortification that he is worsted and driven from 
the field by the athletic vigour of those who know nothing 
but what nature has taught them about the abstract 
nature of mind or the recondite rules of mental philo 
sophy 

it would be tedious to enumerate all the particulars in 
which the system of logic described in this work difiers 
from the other systems now before the public in one 
respect the diflference will be obvious — that is in the 
character and number of the illustrations i have not 
copied from other logical works trivial and fictitious ex 
amples capable of no practical apphcation my illustra 
tions have been gathered from authors of established 
reputation and are generally upon subjects of great pubhc

or private interest i have taken most of mj quotations 
from the bible from books on political economy and from 
newspapers others from books referring to the ordinary 
affairs • of life — chiefly to health education and conduct 
i have not stopped to examine whether i do or do not 
concur in all the sentiments they express i adduce them 
as illustrations of reasoning though i ielieve they will 
 generally be found also to be otherwise useful some have 
been selected because they are entertaining others be 
cause they teach lessons of still higher importance than 
even the art of reasoning 

few alterations have been made in this edition except 
in regard to the illustrationa some of these have been 
shortened some transposed some • omitted ajid others in 
troduced their bearing as examples of reasoning has 
occasionally been more clearly exhibited by a change of 
type the freer use of italics and the excision of superfluous 
sentences so that the student may not allow the informa 
tion the instruction or the humour of the quotation to 
render him unmindm of its logical character for the 
sake of those who might wish to study the science of logic 
as well as the art i have placed in the notes a few 
references to the philosophical work recently published by 
mr samuel bailey on the theory of reasoning the 
object of these changes has been to render the work more 
efficient as a teacher of the art of reasoning in either the 
closet the parlour or the schoolroom without making it less 
interesting to the railway traveller or the general reader 

let no one commence the perusal of this book imder 
the impression that he is about to engage in an exercise 
that is dry toilsome or difficult he will not find it so 
here are no intricate theories in which the reader may 
become bewildered — no knotty questions by which he may 
be embarrassed — and no hard word which he cannot

logic the system which this work professes to teach is 
the logic of common sense that this system is adapted 
to the spirit of the age and that the mode of illustration 
i have adopted is not unsuitable to the subject seems 
abundantly shown by the rapid sale of the first edition 
and the strong commendations of many of our oigans of 
criticism it is very gratifying to observe that the first 
attempt to place before the million in a simple form the

logic foe the million 



you are informed gentle eeader that this book is written 
upon the art of reasoning and is divided into five parts 
the first part treats of the introduction to reasoning 
the second and third parts treat of the principles of 
reasoning the fourth part treats of the forms of 
reasoning and the fifth part treats of the applications 
op reasoning 



part i 

the intkoduction to reasoning 

it seems proper that before we attempt to reason we 
should understand something of the name and nature of 
the art of reasoning — of the subjects on which we reason 
— of the utility of reasoning — of the disposition of mind 
we should possess while engaged in reasoning — and of the 
information that we should previously acquire ¦ these 
several topics will therefore form the subjects of the five 
following sections which taken together are called an 
introduction to the art of reasomng

section l 

the name and nature of the art of reasoning 

the art of reasoning is called logio but you kno 
shakspeare has said — 

wliat we call a eose 
by any other name would smell as sweet 

in the present case we have no occasion for any name 
we might simply say the art of reasoning in the 
same way we say the art of nursing the art of teaching 
the art of dancing or the art of fencing had either of 
these arts a greek name a writer would begin his treatise 
with stating the meaning of this name and probably 
learned men would differ as to the propriety and extent 
of its application 

there is however a convenience in giving distinct 
names to distinct branches of knowledge but have a 
care of supposing that because an art or a science has 
got a hard name there must be something very diflcult 
in the art or science itself many of our arts and sciences 
were taught by the greeks and when our learned men 
first wrote upon them in english they very naturally 
called them by their greek names thus the word logic 
is derived from a greek word logos that signifies dis 
course but these words have no natural connexion with 
the arts and sciences to which they are applied you will 
have made no imimportant step in a knowledge of the 
art of reasoning when you at all times recollect that the 
names of things are quite distinct from the things them 
selves all the processes of reasoning can be as clearly 
described in household words as in those greek words 
in which they are usually expoimded to reason clearly 
and forcibly it is not necessary that you should mder 
stand any other language than your own 

 argumentation or reasonings says dr watts is that 
operation of the mind whereby we irifer one ihing that is

what is logic 

xme proposition from two or more propositions premised 
or it is the drawing a conclusion which before was either 
unknown or dark or doubtful from some propositions 
which are more known and evident so when we have 
judged that matter cannot think and that the mind of 
man doth think we then infer and conclude that therefore 
the mind of man is not matter 

 so we judge that a just governor will make a difference 
between the eil and the good we judge also that god is 
a just governor and from thence we conclude that god 
will make a difference between the evil and the good 

 this argumentation may be carried on further thus 
god will one time or another make a difference between the 
good and the evil but there is little or no difference made 
in this world iiierefore there must be another world 
wherein this difference shall be made 

 these inferences or conclusions sue the effects of rea 
sonings and the three prcsitions taken all together are 
called a syllogism or argument 

 archbishop whately observes mr mill has defined 
logic to be the science as well as the art of reasoning 
meaning by the former term the analysis of the mental 
process which takes place whenever we reason and by the 
latter the rules groimded upon that analysis for conducting 
the process correctly 

zoic then comprises the science of reasoning as well 
as an art founded on that science but the word reason 
ing like most other scientific terms in popular use abounds 
in ambiguities in one of its acceptations it means syllo 
gising in another of its senses to reason is simply to 
infer any assertion from assertions already admitted the 
latter and more extensive signification is that in which 
i mean to use it 

 our object will be to attempt a correct analysis of the 
•intellectual process called reasoning or inference and of 
ch other mental operations as are intended to ilitate 
hiis as well as on the foundation of this analysis and 
pari passu with it to bring together or frame a set of

rules or canons for testing the sufficiency of any gives 
evidence to prove any given proposition 

the reader will perceive that mr mills book is written 
on the science of reasoning our book is written on the art 
of reasoning we use the word reasoning in the wider 
sense used by mr mill and as including what is denoted 
by arguing proving inferring confirming refuting and 
all similar words in the sense in which they are popularly 
understood a knowledge of the art of reasoning is essen 
tial to the study of the science but an acquaintance with 
the science is not necessary to the practice of the art 
indeed it is only by the use of the art that the science 
can be studied we meddle not with the science we 
profess not to analyse any of the powers of the mind nor 
to lay down any new rules for conducting the process of 
reasoning we shall attempt only to describe those rules 
that are already known and to apply them correctly and 
we shall consider their application chiefly with reference to 
tho things with which people are most fjeuniliar 

if a man who understands grammar hear a person say 
 i speaks he will know from general practice that the 
language is improper but he will moreover quote the 
rule that a verb should agree with its nominative case in 
number and person now a collection of such rules form 
grammar or the art of speaking correctly so if a man 
hear a person say — all men are liars for a party has just 
ttld me a lie he will know from his own common sense 
that this is not soimd reasoning but if he has studied 
logic he will also cite the rule universals cannot be in 
ferred from particulars now a collection of all these 
rules form logic or the art of reasoning correctly and the 
man who has a knowledge of these rules and is correct and 
ready in applying them in practice is called a logician a 
man may reason accurately without rules but if he can 
give the rules he will have more confidence in the truth 
of his reasonings he will also be better able to perceive 
the incorrect reasonings of others and to show the sound 
ness or unsoundness of any opinions propounded for his 
consideration 

these practiced rules of reasoning collected together 
form the art of reasoning in the same way as a collection

jof rules for speeiking and writing with propriety form the 
art of speaking and writing with propriety the one art 
is called logic — the other art is called grammar these two 
arts are useful to each other thoughts are expressed in 
words if we think clearly we shall speak clearly and when 
we are learning to arrange our words with accuracy and 
order we are learning to think with accuracy and order 

a person who has acquired a knowledge of grammar 
will afterwards speak and write grammatically without 
ever thinking of the rules of grammar so a person who 
has acquired a knowledge of logic will afterwards reason 
logically without ever thinking of the rules of logic the 
rules will have become so deeply fixed in his mind that 
he will habitually reason accurately and by practice he 
will come to reason promptly and forcibly it is the chief 
business both of grammar and logic to teach us how to 
avoid errors grammar teaches us how to avoid the use of 
words and sentences that are contrary to its rules but a 
beautiful or powerful style of writing must arise from the 
txfistitution of our own minds or the peculiar direction of 
our studies and is not to be acquired merely by an observ 
ance of grammatical construction so logic teaches how 
to know and to discard bad arguments to be able to 
reason promptly and forcibly depends upon our attain 
ments in knowledge — the constitution of our mental powers 
—the extent of our practice — and the degree with which 
we are familiar with the writings of those learned men 
who are celebrated as the masters of the art of reasoning 
drcampbell in his philosophy of rhetoric compares logic 
to the soul and grammar to the body the union of both 
being essential to an excellent discourse

mind may think of things without reasoning about them 
and it may remember things without reasoning about them 
we shall in this section take a view of those truths with 
which we become acquainted by other means than reason 
ing they may be classed into truths of the senses — 
truths of consciousness — truths of the intellect — and truths 
of testimony on these topics we shall quote dr watts 

 truths of the sehses — 

 the evidence of sense is hen we frame a proposition ao 
oordinj to the dictates of any of our senses so we judffe that 
grass is green that a trumpet gives a pleasant sound that jgure 
bums wood water is soft and iron is hard for we haye seen 
heard or felt all these it is upon this evidence of sense that 
we know and believe the daily occurrences in human life and 
ahnost au the histories of mankind that are written by eye or 
earwitnesses are built upon this principle 

under the evidence of sense we do not only include that 
knowledge which is derived to us by our outward senses of 
hearing seeing feeling tasting and smelling but that also which 
is derived from the inward sensations and appetites of hunr 
thirst ease pleasure pain weariness rest cand all those things 
which belong to the body as hunger is a painful appetite light 
is pleasant rest is sweet to the weary limbs 

 truths of consciousness — 

as we learn what belongs to the body by the evidence of 
sense so we learn what belongs to the soul by an inward conscious 
ness which may be called a sort of internal feeling or spiritual 
sensation of what passes in the mind as i think before i speak 
i desire large knowledge i suspect my own practice i studied 
hard today my conscience bears witness of my sincerity my 
soul hates vain thoughts fear is an uneasy passion long medi 
tation on one thing is tiresome 

 thus it appears that we obtain the knowledge of a multitude 
of propositions as well as of single ideas by those two principles 
which mr locke calls sensation and reflection one of them is a 
sort of consciousness of what affects the body and the other is 
a consciousness of what passes in the mind 

 truths of the intellect — 

 intellect relates chiefly to those abstracted propositions which 
carry their own evidence with them and admit no doubt about 
them our perception of this self evidence in any proposition is 
called intelligence it is our knowledge of those first principles

of trtith which are as it were wrought into the rery nature 
and make of our minds they are so evident in themselves to 
every man who attends to them that they need no proof it is 
the prerogative and peculiar excellence of these propositions 
that they can scarce ever he proved or denied they cannot easily 
heprooed because there is nothing supposed to be more clear or 
certain from which an argument may oe drawn to prove them 
they cannot well be denied because their own evidence is so 
brignt and convincing that as soon as the terms are understood 
the mind necessarily assents such are these — whatsoever acted 
hath a being nothing has no properties a part is less than the 
whole nothing can be the cause of itself 

 these propositions are called axioms or marimt or first prin 
ciples these are the very foundations of all improved imowledge 
and reasnmgs and on that account these have been thought to 
be innate propositions or truths bom with us 

 truths of testimony — 

 when we derive the evidence of any proposition from the 
testimony of others it is called the evidence faith and this is 
a large part of our knowledge ten thousand things there are 
which we believe merely upon the authority or credit pf those 
who have spoken or written of them it is by this evidence that 
we know there is such a country as china and there was sxtch a 
man as cicero who dwelt in eome it is by this that most of the 
transactions in human life are managed we know our parents 
and our kindred by this means we know the persons aifd laws of 
our present governors as well as things that are at a vast distance 
from us in foreign nations or in ancient ages 

according as the persons that inform us of anything are 
many or few or more or less wise and faithful and credible so 
our faith is more or less firm or wavering and the proposition 
believed is either certain or doubtful but in matters oi faith an 
exceeding great probability is called a moral certainty 

the truths of reasoning are distinct from all these 
they are derived from these truths or such as these by 
natural and just methods of argumentation 

as logic is the art of reasoning it has nothing to do with 
those truths that are selfevident or which are known to 
be true without reasoning the positive testimoiiy of the 

 mr bailey observes p in philosophical strictness we can be said to know 
ttiif those things which we perceive or have perceived through our organs of 
lense and those states of mind or mental events of which we are or have been con 
idoas other things we believe on evidence more or less cogent that is to sav 
they are matters of inference if so the truths of testimony wiu have to be 
ehised under truths of inference but the word know is often used in a 
more extmded sense

senses supersedes the necessity for reasoning if you have 
the toothache or the gout you want no logic to prove to 
you that you sufifer pain and as we know what passes 
without us by the organs of hearing and seeing — and 
what passes in our bodies by means of our sensations — so 
we know what passes in our minds by means of conscious 
ness we know that we think — that we judge — that we 
remember we know that we hope and we fear — we love 
and we hate all these and a variety of other operations 
and feelings pass within our minds j and we want no logic 
to convince us of their existence there are also many 
other truths that are selfevident we know that two and 
two make four — that a part of anything is less than the 
whole — that a cause must precede the effect — and that a 
proposition cannot be both true and not true at the same 
time and in the same respect these are called jlrst 
truths or truths of intuition they are wrought into our 
very nature and we cannot disbelieve them if we wouldi 
if we meet a man who denies them we do not reason with 
hinu we conclude either that he does not understand the 
meaning of the words or that he has lost his reasoning 
£euulties — here logic has nothing to do 

as logic is merely the art of reasoning it follows that 
logic has nothing to do with those mental operations in 
which we do not reason the mere giving or receiving of 
information is not reasoning if you say to a friend it is 
a cold day there is no logic in that but if you say i 
think we shall have rain in the course of the day that is 
a logical conclusion and if asked to do so you ould be 
prepared to give reasons for your opinion so the acquis 
tion of knowledge by reading or clearing is not reasoning 
you may possibly read history or biography learn seveiil 
languages and become acquainted with botany natural 
history and several sciences without reasoning all this 
requires nothing more than a good memory and hence it 
is possible to become a very learned man and yet not be a 
logician but if you begin to reason about anything you 
learn you immediately become a logician take for illus 
tration a case in history you have read the life of napo 
leon bonaparte and you remember all the events recorded 
and also the opinions of the historian you are no logician

here but if you stop to ask if any particular event 
be true — if you inquire whether in certain actions he 
evinced sagacity or courage — and consider what were the 
effects of his course on the state of eiuxpe— as soon as you 
commence to discuss these or any similar questions you 
become a logician 

as logic has nothing to do with receiving or retaining 
information so also it has nothing to do with imparting 
information or with the giving of advice or commands 
there is no logical process in the following words — be 
not wise in your own conceit — kecompense to no man evil 
for evil — provide things honest in the sight of ail men — 
if it be possible as much as in you lieth live peaceably 
with all men — be not overcome of evil but overcome evil 
with good — but sometimes the terms though simply the 
language of advice or command will imply a logical pro 
cess thus— go to the ant thou sluggard consider her 
ways and be wise which implies that there is some con 
nexion between going to the ant and becoming wise and 
thus it denotes a logi process in the mind of the speaker 
so also if a motive is added this brings the command or 
advice within the province of logic tiius — honour thy 
£ather and thy mother that thy days may be long in the 
land — honour the lord with thy substance and with 
the firstfruits of all thine increase so shall thy bams be 
filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with 
new wine 

logic has no province of its own if you reason at all 
you must reason about something and that something 
may belong to any one of the arts or sciences there is 
no object in nature nor any fact in history but what may 
become a subject of argument thus while logic as an 
art has no domain of its own it has a province in every 
other domain — or rather it is called in whenever necessary 
to settle disputes and exercise supremacy in all the other 
departments of human knowledge a judge on circuit 
has no property in the county in which he administers 
justice nor any authority over its population but shoidd 
any estates in the coimty become the subject of litigation 
or any person become a party in civil or criminal pro 
ceeding then are they immediately brought under his

jurisdiction so whenever any difiference in opinion arises 
either in the arts and sciences or in ordinary life it is the 
province of logic to adjust the dispute thus every object 
in nature every feeling of the mind and every event in 
history may become connected with a logical process we 
will illustrate this by a few examples

stand they generally reason well bat sometimes they 
reason ill and tis the business of the art of reasoning to 
show them when they reason ill and to teach them how to 
reason well such an art cannot be otherwise than usefid 
it must be useful to know how to do weu anything we 
have to do every day and several times aday and when 
we recollect that much of our health our success in busi 
ness our moral and religious character our present and 
 future happiness our reputation in the world and our 
usefulness to others will depend upon the soundness of 
our reasonings the axt will appear to us to be of very high 
importance we shall point out a few respects in which it 
is useful — 

i the art of baasoning is useful by enabling us to form 
our own judgments 

you talk of course about a great many things you 
talk about yourself about your mends and relations and 
acquaintances about your trade and profession about 
the accidents and offences you read of in the newspaper 
about public measures and public men about france 
and russia and america and other nations with whom we 
may be or expect to be at war about right and wrong 
justice and injustice wealth and poverty slavery and 
liberty and on sundays if not on other days you will 
talk about religion or at least about the pope and the 
church and the parson and about people who are sup 
posed to be religious now upon all these subjects and 
a variety of others you will probably give opinions and 
most likely very correct opinions provided you talk only 
of what you understand but to guard against giving 
mcorrect or unguarded opinions you may as well take a 
lesson or two upon the right way of reasoning 

you will say that you can do all this without the aid 
of logic so you can but logic will teach you how to 
do it better logic will teach you tliat you must form 
your opinions by reason alone without any bias from your 
passions or feelings logic wiu teach you that you must 
he able to give a reason for all the opinions you entertain 
logic wiu teach you that you must look at both sides of 
the question and examine the arguments that can be 
advanced against ny opinion as weu as those that may be

advanced in its fitvonr and that you must weigh these 
arguments and see which side preponderates logic will 
teach you that after having done this you must be ready 
to admit any new cts or arguments that may appear on 
either side of the question in these various ways a know 
ledge of the art of reasoning will be useful to yourself 

by thus examining the reasons for your opinions you 
will soon learn to distinguish between good reasons and 
bad ones you will get into the practice of using good 
reasons and discarding bad ones you will thus acquire 
the habit of reasoning well and when assailed with bad 
reasons you will know how to refute them 

ii the art of beasoning is useful in teaching us how 
to give instruction and advice to others 

you will have occasion to give instruction or advice to 
others you will often have occasion to do this in your 
fiunily but besides you may be a director in a publid 
company or on the committee of a charitable institution 
or may be consulted by your friends in cases of emergency 
in all these positions it is desirable you should be able to 
give good advice and to enforce it by reasonable conside 
rations you know that the counsel of ahithophel was so 
highly esteemed that it was as if a man had inquired at 
the oracle of god sam xvi and doubtless you 
have known men who though not gifted with eloquence 
or talent have yet been so remarkable for soundness of 
judgment that they have been treated with universal re 
spect if you accustom yourself to reason well when 
forming your own opinions you will insensibly acquire the 
habit of reasoning well when stating those opinions to 
other people 

iii the art of beasoning is useful by enabling us to 
defend our own principles against the attacks of opponents 
and to give them currency in the world 

you may have to ddend your opinions against the 
attacks of those who hold contrary opinions you must 
not hesitate to do this when the cause of truth or of justice 
requires it when your own character or that of your 
friends or yomr political or religious principles are assmled 
you are bound to make resistance and it will be useful to 
be able to do it well the political and religious differ

ignoble weapons — you will be conscioiis that the force 
of truth and the power of logic will have much greater

 a dispute says mr robinson is an oral controversy and 
a controversy is a written dispute to controvert or dispute 
a point either by word or writin£ is only to agitate a question

religion does not admit of this the whole of the jewish 
religion was a controversy against heathenism the writings of 
prophets are eminently argumentative the book of job is a

themsmes acts xv and they convinced the jews and the 
gentiles by disjmtin with both acts xvii xix every 
article of relijon is denied by some and cannot be believed 
without examination and discussion bv any religion authorizes 
us to investigate debate dispute ana controvert each article in 
order to ascertain its evidence 

iv the art of reasoning is useftd by strengthening the 
memory and systematizing our knowledge — 

 memoiy may be wonderfully strengthened says iclney 
smith by referring single facts and observations to one simple 
principle and by these means we can either remember the pnn 
die bv remembering the fact or the fact bv remembering the 
principle thus if we were to prove that democracy leads to 
despotism we may refer to juuus ctesar cromwell and bona 
parte france has fallen under the dominion of a single man so 
aid rome so have innumerable free countries the cause in many 
instances has been precisely the same — that anarchy which has 
been produced by the licentiousness of the people and which has

v the art of reasoning is useful by tending to prevent 
those evils that arise from the passions or the imagination 
obtaining an ascendancy over the judgment 

 the registers of the bicetre for a series of years show that 
even when madness afltects those who belong to the educated 
classes it is chiefly seen in those whose education has been im 

eerfect or irregular and very rarely indeed in those whose minds 
ave been fully equally and systematically exercised priests 
artists pftinters sculptors poets and musicians whose professions 
so often appear marked in that register are often persons of very 
limited or exclusive education their faculties have oeen unequally 
exercised they have commonly given themselves up too much to 
imagination and have neglected comparison and have not habi 
tuafly exercised the judgment even of this class it is to be 
remembered that it is commonly those of the lowest order of the 
dass in point of talent who become thus affected whilst of 
naturalists physicians chemists and geometricians it is said not 
one instance occurs in these registers if one go from individual 
to individual in any lunatic establishment and investigate the 
character and origin of the madness of each we shall find for 
every one who has become insane from the exercise of his mind 
at least a hundred have become insane from the undue indulgence 
of their feelings those men who really most exercise the 
faculties of their minds meaning thereby all their faculties their 
attention refiection or comparison as well as their imagination 
and memory are least liable to insanity an irregular and in 
judicious cultivation of poetry and pamting has often concurred 
to produce madness but nothing is rarer than to find a mad 
mathematician for as no study demands more attention than 
mathematics so it secures the student during a great part of his 
time from the recurrence of feelings which are always the most 
imperious in those who are the least occupied f

misomid arguments and vague and empty declamation occupy

it is not however solely or chiefly for polemical purposes 
that the cultiyation of the reasoning faculty is desirable in per 
suading and investigating in learning or teaching — in all the 
multitude of cases in which it is our object to arrive at just con 
dusions or to lead others to them it is most important a 
knowledge of logical rules will not indeed supply the want of 
other knowledge nor was it ever proposed tby any one who 
really understood this science to substitute it for any other but 
it is no less true that no other can be substituted for this that 
it is valuable in every branch of study and that it enables us to 
tise the knowledge we possess to the greatest advantage — pre

judioes arising from things from words from oiirselye 
and from others we shall oopj from that chapter and 
fixm some other parts of his work his obsenrations on 
two dispositions which those who wish to reason well 
ought to cultivate we mean the love of truth and a 
spirit of mental independence 

i the love of truth— 

 search for evidence of truth with diligence and honesty and 
be heartily ready to receive evidence whether for agreement or 
disagreement of ideas 

 search loith diligence spare no labour in searching for the 
truth in due proportion to the importance of the proposition 
read the best authors who have writ on that subiect consxdt 
your wise and learned friends in conversation and be not un 
willing to borrow hints toward your improvement from the 
meanest person nor to receive any glimpse of light from the 
most unlearned dilince and hummty is the way to thrive in 
the riches of the understanding as well as in gold or silver 
search carefully for the evidence of truth and dig for wisdom aa 
for hid treasure 

 search with a steadv honesty of soul and a sincere impartiality 
to find the truth watch against eveir temptation that might 
bribe your judgment or warp it aside nrom truth do not in 
dulge yourself to wish any unexamined proposition were true or 
false a wish often perverts the judgment and tempts the 
mind strangely to beheye upon slight evidence whatsoever we 
wish to be true or false 

 keep your mind always open to receive truth and never set 
limits to vour own improvement be ready always to hear what 
may be objected even against your favourite opinions and those 
which have had longer possession of your assent and if there 
should be any new and uncontrollable evidence brought against 
these old or beloved sentiments do not wink your eyes fast 
against the light but part with anything for the sake ot truth 
remember when you overcome an error you gain truth the vic 
tory is on your side and the advantage is all your own 

 in your whole course of reasoning keep your mind sincerely 
intent on the pursuit of truth and fosow soud argument where 
soever it leads you let not a party spirit nor any passion or 
prejudice whatsoever stop or avert the current of your reasoning 
m quest of true knowledge 

 when you are inquiring therefore into any subject maintain 
a due regard to the arguments and obiections on both sides of a 
quation consider compare and balance them well before you

to hnnt after arguments only to make good one side of a question 
and entirely to neglect ana refuse those wliich favour the other 
side if we have not given a due weit to arguments on both 
sides we do but wilfully misguide our judgment and abuse our 
reason bv forbidding its search isifter truth tvlien we jespouse 
opinions by a secret bias on the mind through the influences of 
fear hope honour credit interest or any other prejudice tuid 
then seek arguments only to support those opimons we have 
neither done our duty to god nor to ourselves and it is a matter 
of mere chance if we stumble upon truth in our way to ease and 
preferment the power of reasoning was given us by our maker 
for this very end to pursue truth and we abuse one of his 
richest gifts if we basely yield it up to be led astray by any of 
the meaner powers of nature or the perishing interests of this 
life reason itself if honestly obeyed will lewi us to receive the 
divine revelation of the gospel where it is duly proposed and 
this will show us the path of life everlasting 

ii the spirit of mental independence — 
 independence of mind implies exemption from the 
influence of authority — 

 to believe in all things as our predecessors did is the ready 
way to keep mankind in an everlasting state of infancy and to 
lay an eterxud bar against all the improvements of our reason and 
our happiness had the present age of philosophers satisfied 
themselves with the substantial forms and occult qualities of 
aristotle with the solid spheres eccentrics and epicycles of 
ptolemy and the ancient astronomers then the great lord 
bacon ckpemicus and descartes with the greater sir isaac 
newton mr locke and mr boyle had risen in our world in 
vain we must have blundered on still in successive generic 
tions among absurdities and thick darkness and a hundred use 
ful inventions for the happiness of human life had never been 
known 

besides let us consider that the ffreat god our common 
maker has never given one mans understanding a hgex and 
rightful sovereity to determine truths for others at least after 
they are past tne state of childhood or minority no single 
person how learned and wise and great soever or whatsoever 
natutd or civil or ecclesiastical relation he may have to us cm 
daim this dominion over our faith st paul the aposue in his 
private capacity would not do it nor hath an inspired man any 
sodi authority until he makes his divine commission appear

 presbyter no synod or coimcil no church or assembly of men 
since the days of inspiration hath power derived to them from 
god to make creeds or articles of futh for ns and impose them 
npon our understandings we must all act according to the best 
of our own light and the judgment of our own consciences using 
the best advantages which providence hath civen us with honest 
and impartial difigence to inquire and search out the truth for 
 every one of us must give an account of himself to god 

 independence of mind implies exemption from the 
influence of the passions — 

 the various passions or affections of the mind are numerous 
and endless springs of prejudice they disguise every object 
they converse with and put their own colours upon it and thus 
lead the judgment astray from truth it is love that makes the 
mother think her own cwd the fairest and will sometimes per 
shade us that a blemish is beauty hope and desire make an hour 
of delay seem as long as two or three hours hope inclines ud 
to think there is nothing too difficult to be attempted despair 
tells us that a brave attempt is mere rashness and that eveir 
difficulty is insurmountable fear makes us imagine that a bush 
shaken with the wind has some savage beast in it and multiplies 
the dangers that attend our path sorrow and melancholy tempt 
us to thmk our circumstances much more dismal than tney are 
that we may have some excuse for mourning and enoy represents 
the condition of our neighbour better tlum it is that there may 
be some pretence for her own vexation and uneasiness anger 
and ioratn and revenge and all those hateful passions excite in 
us far worse ideas of men than they deserve and persuade us to 
believe all that is ill of them a detail of the evil influence of 
the affections of the mind upon our judgment would make a large 
volume 

 independence of mind implies exemption from the 
influence of constitutional infirmities — 

 the credulous man is ready to receive everything for truth 
that has but a shadow of evidence eveir new book that he reads 
and every ingenious man with whom he converses has power 
enough to draw him into the sentiments of the speaker or writer 
he has so much complaisance in him or weakness of soul that 
he is ready to resign liis own opinion to the first objection whidi 
he hears and to receive any sentiments of another that are as 
serted with a positive air and much assurance 

 the man of contradiction is of a contrary humour for he 
stands ready to oppose everything that is said he gives a slight

attention to the reasons of other men from an inward scornful 
presumption that they have no strenh in them when he reads 
or hears a discourse different from his own sentiments he does 
not give himself leave to consider whether that discourse maj 
be true but employs all his powers immediately to confute it 
lour great disputers and your men of controversy are in con 
tinual danger of this sort of prejudice they contend often for 
yictoiy and will maintain whatsoever they nave asserted while 
truth is lost in the noise and tumult of reciprocal contradictions 
and it frequently happens that a debate about opinions is turned 
into a mutual reproach of persons 

another sort of temper that is very injurious to a right 
judgment of things is an inconstant fickle changeable spirit and 
a very uneven temper of mind when such persons are in one 
humour they pass a judgment of things agreeable to it when 
their humour changes thev reverse their first judgment and em 
brace a new opimon they have no steadiness of soul they 
want firmness of mind sufficient to establish themselves in any 
truth and are ready to change it for the next alluring falsdiood 
that is agreeable to their change of humour this fickleness is 
sometimes so mingled with their very constitution by nature or 
by distemper of body that a cloudy day and lowering sky shall 
strongly incline them to form an opinion both of themselves and 
of persons and things round about them quite different from 
what they believe wiien the sun shines and the heavens are 
serene 

 this sort of people ought to judge of things and persons in 
their most sedate peaceful and composed hours of life and 
reserve these judgments for their conduct at more unhappy 
seasons 

 independence of mind implies exemption from thq 
influence of manner — 

 there is another tribe of prejudices which is near akin to 
those of authority and that is when we receive a doctrine be 
cause of the manner in which it is proposed to us by others i 
have alreadv mentioned the powerful mfluence that oratory and 
fine words nave to insinuate a false opinion and sometimes truth 
is refused and suffers contempt in the lips of a wise man for want 
of the charms of language but there are several other manners 
of proposals whereby mistaken sentiments are powerfully con 
veyed mto the mind 

 some persons are easily persuaded to believe what another 
dictates with a positive air and a great degree of assuraiice they 
feel the overbearing force of a confident dictator especially if he

 some are quickly oonvinced of the truth of any doctrine 
when he that proposes it puts on al the airs of piety y and makes 
solemn appeals to heayen and protestations of the truth of it 
the pious mind of a weaker cnristian is ready to receive any 
thing that is pronounced with such an awful solemnity 

it is a prejudice near akin to this when a humue soul is 
frighted into any particular sentiments of religion because a man 
of great name or character pronounces heresy upon the contrary 
sentiments casts the disbehever out of the church and forbids 
him the gates of heaven 

 others are allured into particular opinions by gentler prac 
tices on the understanding not only the soft tempers of mankind 
but even hardy and rugged souls are sometimes led away captives 
to error by the soft air of address and the sweet and engaging 
methods of persuasion and kindness 

 inhere is another manner of proposing our own opinion or 
rather opposing the opinions of others which demands a mention 
here and that is when persons make a jest serve instead of an 
argument when they refute what they call error by a turn of wit 
and answer every obiection against their own sentiments by 
casting a sneer upon tiie objector these scoffers practise with 
success upon weak and cowardly spirits such as have not been 
well established in religion or morality have been laughed out of 
the best principles by a confident buffoon they have yielded up 
their opinions to a witty banter and sold their faith and religion 
for a jest 

 there is no way to cure these evils in such a degenerate 
world as we live in but by learning to distinguish well oetween 
the substance of any doctrine and the manner tf address either in 
proposing attacking or defending it and then by setting a just 
and severe guard of reason and conscience over all the exercises 
of our judgment resolving to yield to nothing but the convincing 
evidence of truth religiously obeying the lignt of reason in mat 
ters of pure reason and the dictates of revelation in things that 
relate to our faith

schoolmaster very severe easily believes that fondness always 
belongs to uncles and that severity is essential to masters or in 
structors he has seen also soldiers with red coats or ministers 
with long black gowns and therefore he persiiades himself that 
these garbs are essential to the characters and that he is not a 
minister who has not a long black gown nor can he be a soldier 
who is not dressed in red it would be well if all such mistakes 
ended with childhood 

when we have just reason to admire a man for his virtues 
we are sometimes inclined not only to neglect his weaknesses but 
even to put a good colour upon them ana to think them amiable 
when we read a book that has many excellent truths in it and 
divine sentiments we are tempted to approve not only that whole 
book but even all the writings of that author when a poet an 
orator or a painter has performed admirably in several illustrious 
pieces we sometimes also admire his very errors we mistake his 
olunders for beauties and are so ignorantly fond as to copy after 



 this sort of prejudice is relieved by learning to dutinguish 
things well and not to judge in the lump there is scarce any 
thing in the world of nature or art in the world of morality or 
reugion that is perfectly uniform there is a mixture of wisdom 
and folly vice and virtue good and evil both in men and things 
we oidd remember that some persons have great wit and little 
iudgment others are judicious but not witty some are good 
humoured without compliment others have all the formalities of 
complaisance but no good humour we ought to know that one 
man may be vicious and learned while another has virtue without 
learning that many a man thinks admirably well who has a 
poor utterance while others have a charming manner of speech 
but their thoughts are trifling and impertinent some are good 
neighbours and courteous and charitable toward men who have 
no piety towards god others are truly religious but of morose 
natural tempers some excellent saying are found in very silly 
books and some silly thoughts appear in books of value we 
should neither praise or dispraise by wholesale but separate the 
good from the evil and judge of them apart the accuracy of a 
good judgment consists much in making such distinctions

thb knowledge necessary to the art op reasoning 

i need hardly observe that to reason well you must have 
common sense this can be obtained only from nature 
while learning will increase your information extend 
your range of inquiry and unlock new sources of the 
most refined pleasure it will not give you common 
sense nor does it appear that this common sense is ever 
much improved by learning as is the child in this 
respect so is the man it is possible to have a strong 
memory and a weak understanding fools have become 
learned and still have remained fools men of vast 
erudition have shown themselves weak in judgment even 
in regard to those branches of knowledge in which they 
have obtained distinction — and miserably deficient in the 
ordinary aflrs of life it is only by common sense that 
we can reason and can judge of the soundness of our 
reasonings this power or faculty of the mind is not 
sparingly bestowed it is given to almost every man and 
to an extent that is found adequate for all the functions 
he is called upon to discharge common sense has been 
good sense in every age of the world 

presuming then gentle reader that ypu are endowed 
with common sense i will proceed to show you what 
further is required to enable you to reason well our 
instructions will be taken chiefly from the logic of dr 
watts 

 to reason well you must imderstand the subjects 
that you reason about 

go to the marketplace and listen to the conversation 
between the buyers and the sellers how readily the 
sellers advance arguments to show that their goods are 
very cheap and how promptly the buyers answer these 
arguments and strongly argue on the other side now 
hof is it that these uneducated people are enabled to 
argue so forcibly and so fluently it is that they im

logical definitin 

derstand what they are talking about and this must be 
the first step in all our reasonings 

we begin therefore by stating clearly what is the sub 
ject of discussion and this is ojled giving a definition 
tf it 

in order to form a definition of any things we must put forth 
thee three acts of the mind 

pirst compare the thing to he defined with other things that 
are most like itself and see wherein its essence or nature agrees 
with them and this is called the general nature or genus in a 
dnition so if you would define wnat wine is first compare it 
with other thin like itself as cider perry c and you to find 
it agrees essentially with them in this that it is a sort of juice 

 secondly consider the most remarkable and primary attri 
bute property or idea wherein this thin differs from those other 
things that are most like it and that is its essential or specific 
difference so wine differs from cider andperry and all other 
juices in that it is pressed from a pe this may be called its 
special nature which distinguishes it irom other juices 

thirdly join the general and special natiure together or 
which is all one the genus and the difference and these make up 
a definition so the juice of a grape or juice pressed from 
grapes is the definition of wine 

 so if i would define what winter is i cmsider first wherein 
it agrees with other things which are most like it namely 
stumner spring autumn and i find they are all seasons of the 
year therefore a season of the year is the genus then i ob 
serve wherein it differs from these and that is in the shortness 
of the days for it is this which does primarily distinguish it 
firom other seasons therefore this may be cled its special 
nature or its difference then hj joining these together i make 
a definition mnter is that season of the year wherein the days 
are shortest 

but everything cannot be defined in this formal mann 
and we may adopt any mode of expression we please pro 
vided it will convey to others a correct description of what 
we mean thus we may say — 

 motion is a change of place swiftness is the passing over a 
long space in a short time a natural day is the time of one 
altnate revolution of light and darkness or it is the duration 
of twentyfour hours an eclipse of the sun is a defect in the 
suns transmission of lit to us by the moon interposing snow

 to reason well you must clearly understand what is 
asserted about the subjeot 

a proposition is a sentence wherein two or more ideas or terms 
are joined or disjoined by one affirmation or negation as tlato 
was a philosopher every angle is formed by two lines meeting 
no man living on earth can be completely happy when there 
are ever so many ideas or terms in the sentence yet if they are 
joined or disjoined merely by one single affirmation or negation 
they are properly called but one proposition though they may be 
resolved mto several propositions which are implied tnerein as 
will appear hereafter 

 tnere are three things which go to the nature and constitu 
tion of a proposition namely the subject the predicate and the 
copida 

the subject of a proposition is that concerning which anything 
is affirmed or denied so plato aujgle man living on eartv re 
the subjects of the foregoing propositions 

 the predicate is that wmch is affirmed or denied of the sub 
ject so philosopher is the predicate of the first proposition 
formed by two lines meetinff is the predicate of the second 
 capable of being completely nappy the proper predicate of the 
third 

 the subject and predicate of a proposition taken together 
are called the maiter of it for these are the materials ofwhich 
it is made 

 the copula is the form of a proposition it represents the act 
of the mind affirming or denying and it is expressed by the words 
am art is are o or am not art not is not are not c 

the stjject and predicate of a proposition are not always 
to be known and distinguished by the placing of the words in the 
sentence but by reflectmg duly on the sense of the words and 
on the mind or design of the speaker or writer as if i say in 
africa there are many hons i mean many lions are existent in

logical language 

africa many lions is the subject and existent in africa is the 
predicate it is proper for a plulosopher to understand geometry 
here the word proper is the predicate and dl the rest is the 
subject except is the copula 

but there are some propositions wherein the terms of the 
subject and predicate seem to be the same yet the ideas are not 
the same nor can these be called pure identical or trifling pro 
positions such as home is home that is home is a convement 
or delightful place socrates is socrates still that is the man 
socrates is still a philosopher the hero was not a hero that is 
the hero did not snow his courage what i have written i have 
written that is what i wrote i still approve and wiu not alter 
it what is done is done that is it cannot be undone it may 
be easily oberved in these propositions the term is equivocal 
for in the predicate it has a different idea from what it has in 
the subject 

 to reason well you must know how to express your 
self in clear and intelligible language 

as we are led into the knowledge of things by words so we 
are oftentimes led into error or mistake by the use or abuse of 
words abo and in order to guard against such mistakes as 
well as to promote our improvements in knowledge it is necessary 
o acquaint ourselves a little with words and terms 

words whether they are spoken or written have no natural 
connexion toith the ideas they are designed to signify nor with the 
things which are represented in those ideas there is no manner 
of affimty between the sounds white in english or blanc in french 
wid that colour which we call by that name nor have the letters 
of which these words are composed any natural aptness to signify 
that colour rather than red or green words and names there 
fore are mere arbitrary signs invented by men to communicate 
their thoughts or ideas to one another 

 words and terms are either univoeal or equivocal univocal 
words are such as signify but one idea or at least but one sort of 
thing equivocal words are such as signify two or more different 
ideas or different sorts of objects tke words book bible fish 
flouse elephant may be called univocal words for i know not 
that they signify anything else but those ideas to which they are 
generally fixed 



 but head is an equivocal word for it signifies 

the head of a nail or of a pin as well as of an animal nail is an 
equivocal word it is used for the nail of the hand or foot and 
for an iron nail to fasten anything post is equivocal it is a 
piece of timber oi swift messenger a church is a reugious 
assembly or the large fair building where they meet and some 
times the same word means a synod of bishops or of presbyters 
and in some places it is the pope and a general councu

 here let it be noted that when two or more words signify 
the same thing as wave and billow mead and meadow they are 
nsoallj called synonymous words but it seems very stran that 
words which are directly contrary to each other should some 
times represent almost the same ideas yet thus it is in some few 
instances a valuable or an invaluable blessing a shameful or a 
shameless villain a thick skull or a thinskulled fellow — a mere 
paper skull a man of a large conscience little conscience or no 
conscience a famous rascal or an infamous one so uncertain a 
thing is human language whose foundation and support is custom 

as words signifying the same thing are called synonymous so 
equivocal words or those which signify several things are called 
homonymous or ambijgous and when persons use such ambigu 
ous words with a desi to deceive it is called equivocation 

in your own studies as well as in the communication of your 
thoughts to others merely for their information avoid ambiguous 
atd equivocal terms as muck as possible do not use such words 
as have two or three definitions of the name belonging to them 
that is such words as have two or three senses where there is 
any danger of mistake where your chief business is to inform 
the judgment and to explain a matter rather than to persuade 
or aifect be not fond of expressing yourselves in neurative 
language when there are any proper words that signify the same 
idea in their literal sense 

when we communicate our notions to others merely with a 
desi to inform and improve their knowledge let us in the be 
ginmng of our discourse take care to adjust the definition of 
names wheresoever there is need of it that is to determine 
plainly what we mean by the chief words which are the subject of 
our discourse and be sure always to keep the same ideas when 
soever we use the same words unless we give due notice of the 
change this will have a very large and happy influence in 
securing not only others but ourselves too from confusion and 
mistake for even writers and speakers themselves for want of 
due watchfulness are ready to affix different ideas to their own 
words in different parts of their discourses and hereby bring per 
plexity into their own reasonings and confound their hearers 

 in communicatbig your notions use every word as near a 
possible in the same sense in which mankind commonly use it or 
which writers that have gone before you have usually affixed to 
it upon condition that it is free from ambiguity though namea 
are m their original merely arbitrary yet we should always keep 
to the established meaning of them unless great necessity recuires 
the alteration for when any word has been used to sigmfy an 
idea that old idea will recur in the mind whdh the word is heard 
or read rather than any new idea which we may fasten to it 
and this is one reason why the received defimtion of nameai 
should be changed as little as possible

 to reason well you must accustom yourself to ob 
serve the reasonings of others whether in books or conyer 
sation and try to improve your own by meditation and 
practice 

accustom yourselves to dear and distinct ideas to evident 
propositions to strong and convincing arguments converse 
mnch with those friends and those books and those parts of 
learning where you meet with the greatest clearness of thought 
and force of reasoning the mathematical sciences and particu 
larly arithmetic geometry and mechanics abound with these 
advantages and if there were nothing valuable in them for the 
uses of human life yet the very speculative parts of this sort of 
learning are well worth our stuay for by perpetual examples 
they teach us to conceive with clearness to connect our ideas and 
propositions in a train of dependence to reason with strength and 
demonstration and to distinguish between truth and falsehood 
something of these sciences snould be studied by every man who 
pretends to learning and that as mr locke expresses it not 
so much to make us mathematicians as to make us reasonable 
creatures 

 we should gain such a familiaritv with evidence of perception 
and force of reasoning and get such a habit of discmin clear 
troths that the mind mav be soon offended with obscurity and 
confosion then we shall as it were naturally and with ease 
lestram our minds from rash judgment before we attain just 
evidence of the proposition which is offered to us and we snail 
with the same ease and as it were naturally seize and embrace 
every truth that is proposed with just evidence 

this habit of conceiving clearly of judging justly and of 
reasoning well is not to be attained merelv by the happiness of 
constitution the brightness of genius the oest natural parts or 
the best collection of logical precepts it is custom and practice 
that must form and establish this habit we must apply ourselves 
to it till we perform all this readily and without reflecting on 
roles a coherent thinker and a strict reasoner is not to be 
made at once by a set of rules any more than a good painter or 
musician may be formed extempore by an excellent lecture on 
music or painting it is of infinite importance therefore in our 
younr years to be taught both the value and the practice of 
conceiving dearly and reasoning right for when we are grown 
up to the middle of hfe or past it it is no wonder that we should 
not learn good reasoning any more than that an ignorant down 
should not be aue to learn fine language dancing or a courtly 
behaviour when his rustic airs have grown up with him till the

part ii 

the pbinciples of reasoning 

wb have now made some progress we have gone 
through the first part of our book we have considered 
the nature of reasoning — the subjects to which it is 
applied — its useftdness and the dispositions and knowledge 
necessary to enable us to reason well 

we have ascertained that reasoning is that operation of 
the mind whereby we infer one proposition from another 
proposition it is obvious that there must be some con 
nexion or relation between these two propositions there 
must be a relation between the proposition containing the 
proof and the proposition which is to be proved these 
relations are the foundation of all our reasonings they 
are the principles on which we reason there must be 
a relation between any doctrine and the reasons we assign 
for believing that doctrine there must be a relation 
between any act and the reason we assign for performing 
that act if we say 

fire wiu bum 
water will diown 

here are two independent propositions they have no con 
nexion with each other we can infer nothing from them 
if we say fire will bum and therefore water will drown 
we see at once that the reasoning is absurd both the 
facts are true but there is no foundation for the word 
 therefore one fact is not the cause of the other but 
if we say fire will bum and therefore do not approach it 
too nearly water will drown and therefore do not bathe 
in deep water mdess you can swim here the reasoning is 
obvious here is a relation or connexion between liie 
proposition and the inference 

the power or facidty by which the mind perceives these 
relations is called commonsense we cannot explain

subject and attbibutb 

how it is but so it is these relations are so numeroiis 
that we cannot attempt to desoribe them all but we 
will specify a few and discuss them in the following 
order — 

 the relation of subject and attribute 

 the relation of a whole and its parts 

 the relation of genus and species 

 the relation of cause and effect— physical causes 

 the relation of cause and eflfect—moral causes 

 the relation of cause and effect — conditional causefil 

 the relation of cause and effect — final causes 



section l 

the relation op a subject and its attributes 

by attribute we mean generally ft quality or circumstance 
which is ascribed to some person or thing and the subject 
is that to which the attribute is ascribed to explain — 
you understand grammar you know that a substan 
tive is the name pf any persouj place or thing and that 
an adjective is a word added to a substantive to denote its 
quality well for substantive and adjective say subject 
and attribute and you will understand pretty clearly the 
topics of the present section but the word attribute has 
a more extensive meaning than the word adjective every 
adjective denotes an attribute but sometimes an attribute 
is expressed by a verb a particle or by several words put 
together often too an adjective united to a substantive 
wul become a subject when you say simply a righteous 
man the word man denotes the subject and righteous 
ness is the attribute but when you say a righteous man 
regardeth ihe life of his beast ihe words righteous and 
man united denote the subject and rgardeth the hfe 

• the cogency of no direct and simple process of reasoning can b the subject 
of proof the only question is does the reasoning vhen clearly expressed pro 
duce conviction or in other words do the facts when presented ciearly to the 
mind determine it to believe that which is expressed in what is called the con 
clusion t if they do we have reached an ultimate fact or law or principle of 
out mental constitution beyond which it is impossible to go— bailey p

 logio for the million 

of his beast is the attribute of the righteous man what 
ever you talk about is a subject and what you say about 
it is an attribute in many propositions the subject oi 
the attribute is often the subject of the proposition and 
the attribute is the predicate but this will depend on 
the grammatical construction of the sentence for ex 
ample in the following sentence blessed is the man 
that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor 
standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of 
the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord 
and in his law doth he meditate day and night the word 
 blessed denotes the attribute and all the rest of the 
sentence is the subject 

some attributes are called specific they belong to the 
subject and to no other subject these are attributes 
chiefly that distinguish one class or species firom others 
thus man is called a rational animal rationality is 
the specific attribute that distinguishes him fiom other 
animals the specific attribute is called by logicians a 
specific difference 

other attributes are called common they are essential 
to the subject but they belong also to other subjects 
thus it is an attribute of gold to be yellow if a metal is 
not yellow it is not gold but other things are yellow 
besides gold the colour yellow is an attribute common 
to many subjects these common attributes are called 
properties 

other attributes are accidental whatever attribute 
can be removed fiom the subject without destroying the 
subject is considered to be accidental a hat may be 
white or black or made of beaver silk or straw these 
are accidental attributes for they all might be changed 
and yet the subject remain a hat these attributes are 
called accidents 

this relation of subject and attribute is a very extensive 
 one almost everything we see or hear or know is a 
subject and has some kind of attributes the usual way 
in which we define or describe anything is by an enume 
ration of its attributes we shall here adduce a few pro 
positions expressing this relation and then we shall show 
how this relation is employed in reasoning

you will now obeerve how the relation of subject aod 
attribute is applied in reasoning 

 from the presence of the subject we infiar the 
presence of the attribute 

 a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in 
till forwards — frov xxii 

hence we should infer that if this man be a fool he 
wiu utter all his mind and if he be a wise man he will 
be cautious in his conversation from the presence of the 
subject we should infer the presence of the attribute 

arguments of this kind are often expressed in a con 
ditional form thus we may say — if this be a magnet 
it will auract iron if this be an oyster it is good for food 
if he be a wise son he will obey his fethers instruction 
if he be an honest man he will pay his debts when he has 
the power even though his creditors may have given him 
a legal release if he be a good feither he will attend to 
the education of his children could not this man 
which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even 
this man should not have died — john xi 

so if a man has wealth we may infer that he has the 
luxuries enjoyments and influence attendant on wealth 
if he has xdsdom we may infer that he will profit by in 
struction give instruction to a wise man and he will 
be yet wiser if a man is a rogue we may infer that it 
is not advisable to lend him any money for the wicked 
borroweth and payel not again 

 from the presence of the qecific attribute or of 
all the common attributes we infer the presence of the 
subject 

 ye shall know thn by their fruits bo men gather grapes 
of thorns or figs of thistles p even so every good tree brmgeth 
forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a

good tree cannot bring forth evil froit neither can a corrapt tree 
brinff forth good hv—matt vii — 

 le are mj mends if ye do whatsoeyer i command yon— 
joim xv u 

you whl observe that this role is the reverse of the 
former by the former rule from the presence of the 
subject we inferred the presence of the attribute by this 
rule from the presence of the attribute we infer the 
presence of the subject in the former case we said — this 
is a good tree therefore it will bear good fruit in the 
present case we say — this tree bears good fruit therefore 
it is a good tree 

thus if we saw a tree bearing apples we should know 
that it was an appletree and from tiie quality of the 
fruit we should judge of the character of the tree in the 
same manner from the language or conduct of an indivi 
dual we should form an opinion of his chioaoter — these 
are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil 
open the eyes of the blind — john x 

so if we oidd find a metal having all the common 
attributes of gdd we should know that it is gold this 
principle is of great use in chemical experiments thus 
we know that certain bodies have certain affinities for 
other bodies to ascertain therefore whether this body 
be present in any compoimd substance we add some body 
for which the body whose presence we wish to detect has 
an affinity or upon which it produces a known effect 
there are certain chemical tests which are in constant use 
in such cases thus the presence of the specific attribute 
shovts the presence of the subject 

so if an auctioneer had to sell a house he would enume 
rate au its attributes in order to show that it is a most 
agreeable residence the projector of a new comjny enu 
merates all its attributes in ord to show that its shares 
would turn out a most profitable iwvettment a candidate 
hr a seat in the house of commons states all his attributes 
in order to prove that he should be a most valuable member 

to enable you to infer from a single attribute the 
presence of tiie subject that attribute must be a specific 
attribute that is it must belong to no other subject see 
p thus if it be an attribute of an express train on 



y google 



d xiogio vor thbslolliok 

any railway that it does not stop at the intermediate 
stations you may say — this train does not stop at 
the intermediate stations therefore this train is aii 
eiress train here from the presence of the attribute 
we infer the presence of the subject but mind if there 
are other trains besides the express trains that do not stop 
at the intermediate stations this conclusion may not be 
correct for then the attribute is no longer a specific 
attribute but a common attribute and from the presence 
of an attribute that is common to several subjects you can 
not infer the presence of any particular subject all you 
can do is to infer the presence of either one or other of the 
subjects thus the express trains and the mail trains 
are the only trains that do not stop at this station the 
train which has just passed has not stopped at this station 
therefore the train which has just passed is either an 
express irain or a mail train 

but in conformity with the first rule you may always 
from the presence of the subject infer the presence of the 
attributes even though the same attributes may belong to 
other subjects thus you may say — none of the express 
trains stop at the intermediate stations the train that 
leaves at nine oclock is an express train therefore the 
train that leaves at nine oclock will not stop at the in 
termediate stations 

 from the absence of the subject we infer the absence 
of its specific attribute 

 if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of 
abraham — john viii 

 he that is of god heareth qods words je therefore hear 
them not because ye are not of god — john viii 

thus we may say — this animal is not a human being 
therefore he is not endowed with reason religion is lie 
only source of happiness this man has no religion there 
fore he is not happy this man is not an educated man 
therefore he is not qualified to be a teacher this man has 
had no experience in war therefore he cannot be qualified 
to be a general he has an impediment in his speech 
therefore he is not fit for an orator those who had no

trial exhibition of somp of the exhibitors had no 
mason tickets therefore some of the exhibitors did not 
attend the opening of the exhibition 

although the absence of a subject shows the absence 
of its fpedjic attribute it does not prove the absence of any 
of its common attributes or properties for these attri 
butes belong also to other subjects thus honesty is an 
attribute of religion but we cannot say that if a man is 
not a religious man he is not an honest man for a man 
may be honest without being religious but we may 
reverse the case and from the absence of the common 
attribute infer the absence of the subject we may say — 
if a man is not an honest man he is not a religious man 

 from the absence of an essential attribute we inf 
the absence of the subject

in the illustration we have given it is presumed that the

pity if any have no feeling for their fellowcreatures wants and 
are contented to enjoy themselves without bestowing a thought 
on those who have m this life evu things you plainly perceive 
that the blessing bestowed on the merciful is not adoressed to 
you you must expect judgment without mercy if you have 
shown no mercy

 if any two attributes may be ascribed to the same 
subject then we may infer that these two attributes are 
not inconsistent with each other 

sir isaac newton was a great philosopher and also a 
man of strong religious principle hence we infer that 
philosophy is not incompatible with religion the late 
sir bobert pee had a taste for the fine arts he was also a 
good man of business hence we infer that a taste for the 
fine arts is not incompatible with habits of business sir 
thomas fowell buxton was a very benevolent man and 
yet a great sportsman and hence we infer that beneyolent 
feelings are not incompatible with a fondness for field 
qports the law of moses required the israelites to treat 
all strangers with justice and kindness and yet the law of 
moses allowed the israebtes to receive interest for money

writers on scholastic logic repeat the subject in this 
kind of argument so as to form two propositions which 
they usually place under one another and the conclusion 
under them and these three propositions taken together 
they call a syllcism thus — 

sir robert peel had a taste for the fine arts 
sir bobert peel was a good man of business 
therefore a taste for the fine arts is not incompatible 
with habits of business

no bombastic yriters are worthy of imitatioiu 

some bombastic writers are amusing 

some things amusing are not worthy of imitation 

this mode of reasoning may also be expressed in the 
form of example thus — a taate for the fine arts is not 
incompatible with habits of business in proof of this we 
may cite the example of sir robert peel some who do 
honour to their country have not escaped poverty which is 
proved by the history of some of our distinguished poets 
 a very interesting book may consist chiefly of quotations 
witness disraelis curiosities of literature the fol 
lowing are instances of the same kind of argument expressed 
in a different form — the example of virgil shows that a 
great poet may be seduced into some faults by the practice 
of imitation a man remarkable for his knowledge and 
policy the wisdom of his maxims the justness of his 
reasoning and the variety distinctness and strength of his 
characters may want exactness in his diction and be care 
less in the art of writing for we find all these qualities 
united in lord clarendon 

you will observe that this argument must not be pushed 
too fiar it does not prove that either of the two attributes 
is the cause of the other or that they always or even 
often accompany one another but merely that they are 
not incompatible thus if we say the tastorian gibbon 
was a man of great learning and a man of infidel opinions 
this woiild not prove that great lemming is the cause ot 
infidel opinions or that they often accompany each other 
it shows only that they are not incompatible — that they 
may coexist in the same subject 

 if the same attribute cannot be ascribed to two 
specified subjects then we may infer that those subjects 
are difierent firom each other 

thus if the soul of man can reason and the soul of a 
brute cannot reason we infer that the soul of a man is 
different from the soul of a brute if all fever produces 
thirst and the patient does not suffer thirst we infer that 
the patient has no fever a spirit hath not flesh and 

 these examples illustrate the third figure of syllogistic reasoning the 
maxim is when the whole of a class possess a certain attribute and the whole 
dr part of the class possess another attribute then ome things that possess one 
of these attributes possess the other also— see bailey p

 the presence of similar attributes in two or more 
subjects shows the probability of their corresponding in 
other attributes this is called reasoning by analogy 
which we shall discuss more at length hereafter we will 
here give only one example 

 it is natural to mankind to judge of things less known by 
some simihtude real or imaginary between them and things more 
familiar or better known and where the things compared have 
really a great similitude in their nature when there is reason to 
think that they are subject to the same laws thmre may be a 
considerable degree of probability in conclusions drawn from 
analogy thus we may observe a very great simihtude between 
this earth which we inhabit and the other planets saturn jupiter 
mars venus and mercury they all revolve round the sun as 
the earth does although at different distances and in different 
periods they borrow all their light from the sun as the earth 
does several of them are known to revolve round their axis 
like the earth and by that means must have a like succession of 
day and night some of them have moons that serve to give 
them light in the absence of the sun as our moon does to us 
they are all in their motions subiect to the same law of gravi 
tation as the earth is prom all this similitude it is not un

 the presence of any attribute shows the absenoe of 
 contrary attribute this of course refers only to acci 
dental attributes for an essential attribute cannot be 
absent from its subject thus if the weather be hot it 
is not cold if a man be humble he is not proud if 
avaricious hie is not liberal if he have the gout he is not 
in good health 

the presence of an accidental attribute in one initance 
proves the possibility of suck a subject becoming united 
to such an attribute in any similar case wisdom is the 
accidental attribute of a man and therefore we are justified 
in inferring that a man may become wise in tho same 
way wealth learning virtue happiness are attribu of 
man and though not essential attributes but only acci 
dental yet they may all be acquired sometimes as we 
have observed at page an accidental attribute may be 
united to a subject and form a new subject which may 
have other attributes thus we may say — a wise man wiu 
receive instruction here the word wise is not viewed 
as an attribute but as with man forming a subject and 
a readiness to receive instruction is an essential attribute 
of a wise man 

in reasoning upon the relation subsisting between subject 
and attribute it is always necessary to distinguish between 
those attributes which are essential and those which are acci 
dental for if we take accidental attributes and aigue upon 
them as though they were essential our reasonings will be 
erroneous dius tbe poet ovid had a large nose this 
was a mere accidental circumstance and was by no means 
essential to him as a poet i therefore we were to meet a 
man in the street with a lai nose we ediotild not be justi 
fied in inferring that he was a poet some men of great 
minds have had feeble bodies but it does not follow that a 
feeble body tends to invigorate the mind some men of 
great inteuectual powers have been addicted to great vices 
but it does not follow that great vices are a mark of 
intellect

the things that have parts are subjects having attributes 
such are all animals all vegetables all material objects 
and all particles of matter and all mechanical instruments 
of every kind an animal may be divided into head 
trunk and limbs a tree may be divided into root trunk 
branches leaves and fruit a steamengine may be divided 
into the several parts of which it is composed a day may 
be divided into hours a book may be divided into parts

into sections or verses an art or science may be divided 
into parts political economy may be divided into pro 
duction distribution interchange and consumption the 
business of a manufactory may be divided into its various 
operations a cotton manufacture may be divided into 
the departments of spinning weaving dyeing and printing 
a pound sterling may be divided into shillings and ea 
shilling into pence a bushel may be divided into gallons 
and each gallon into quarts and pints a mile may be 
divided into furlongs and each furlong into yards a ton 
weight may be divided into hundreds and these into poimds 
and ounces a palace may be divided into apartments 
a house may be divided into rooms a farm may be 
divided into acrjs 
upon this subject we shall quote dr watts — 

each part singly taken must contain less than the whole hut 
all the parts taken collectively or together must contain neither 
more nor less than the whole therefore if in discoursing of a 
tree you divide it into the trunk and leaves it is an imperfect 
division because the root and the branches are needful to make 
up the whole

immediate parts of the subject and not divide it at once into the 
more minute and remote parts it would by no means be proper 
to divide a kingdom first into streets and lanes and fields out 
it must be first divided into provinces or counties then those 
counties may be divided into towns villages fields c and 
towns into streets and lanes 

the several parts of a division ought to be opposite that is 
oa part ought not to contain another it would be a ridiculous 
division of an animal into head limbs body and brains for the 
brains are contained in the head 

 let not subdivisions be too numerous without necessity for 
it is better many times to distinguish more parts at once if the 
subject will bear it than to mince the discourse by excessive 
dividing and subdividing it is preferable therefore in a treatise 
of geophy to j tlmt in a city we will consider its walls its 
gates its duildings its streets and lanes than to divide it for 
mally first into the encompassing and the encompassed parts the 
encompassing parts are the walls and gates the encompassed 
parts include the ways and the buildings the ways are the streets 
and the lanes buildings consist of the foundations and the 
superstructure c 

divide every subject according to the special design you have 
in view one and the same idea or subject may be divided in 
very different manners according to the different purposes we 
have in discoursing of it so if a printer were to consider the 
several parts of a book he must divide it into sheets the sheets 
into pages the pages into lines and the lines into letters but a 
grammarian divides a book into periods sentences and words or 
parts of speech as noun pronoun verb o a logician considers 
a book as divided into chapters sections arguments propositions 
ideas and with the help of ontology he divides the propositions 
into subject object property relation action passion cause 
effect c but it would be very ridiculous for a logician to 
divide a book into sheets pages and lines or for a printer to 
divide it into nouns and pronouns or into propositions ideas 
• properties or causes 

in all your divisions observe with greatest exactness the 
nature of things 

we shall consider the relation between a whole and its 
parts with reference to arithmetical numbers physical 
objects and moral ideas 

 with regard to arithmetical numbers

parts as it contains units and again a unit may be divided 
into any number of fractional parts it is obvious that

all the parts into which any number is divided must when 
added together be equal to the whole number a sove 
reign is equal to twenty shillings if then ydu receive m

infer that you have not the whole a pound weight is 
equal to sixteen ounces i then in buying a poimd of tea 
 or of sugar you get only fifteen ounces you will infer that 
you have not the whole 

again if two numbers that are equal to one another be 
multiplied respectively by any number the products will 
be equal if one indian rupee be equal to one shilling and 
tenpence you will infer that twenty rupees will be eqiml to 
twenty times one shilling and tenpence so also — 

if equal numbers be added to equal numbers the totals 
will be equal 

if equal numbers be subtracted from equal nimibers 
the remainders will be equal 

if equal numbers be divided by equal numbers the 
quotients will be equal 

these maxims are too obvious to require any illustration 
they form the foundation of much of our reasoning with 
regard to figures and quantities 

addition subtraction multiplication and division are the 
four operations with regard to numbers and these opera 
tions are often called into exercise not only with regard to 
our physical but also with regaid to our moral reasonings

to which they may be applied thus we leam that cer

discover the effects of particular kinds of food —

 let us now observe how the value of a commodity resolves 
itself into three component parts take for instance a load of 
hay its price pays first the wages of the labourer who cut down 
the grass and made it into hay — then the profits of the farmer

this therefore constitutes the whole cost of production of the 
load of hay and may be called its natural value — mrs marcet 

 we shall now consider the application of this prin

the word moral is not used here in its ethical sense as 
opposed to immoral but as opposed to physical we 
cannot divide these ideas into parts so readily as we can 
divide arithmetical numbers or as we may carve a fowl

to denote the simple ideas of which they are composed

number of managers is prosperous each manager will 
take to himself a high degree of credit for having caused 
that prosperity on the other hand when the society 
becomes involved in difficulties each manager is anxious 
to show that no part of the blame belongs to him thus 
the totals of the praise or blame which each manager 
is willing to take to himself is more or less than the total 
that belongs to the whole body it should be recollected 
in such cases that whether of applause or censure the 
total of all the parts cannot be either more or less than

the belation of genlts and species 

this relation is founded upon the act of classification 
let us take a tree there are many kinds of trees as the 
oak the elm and there is a great number of oaks and 
elms here then a tree is the oenus oak elm are the 
species and a particular oak or elm that we may happen 
to see is aa individual 

in au the branches of natural history classification is 
very generally introduced it is a rule that the genus 
can always he asserted of each species thus we can say 
an oak is a tree — an elm is a tree — a vine is a tree 
this shows that tree is a genus and that oak elm and 
vine are species under that particular genus we may 
say — a horse is an animal an ox is an animal a dog is an 
animal this proves that animal is a genus and that dog 
horse and ox are species under that genus each species 
may again be divided into inferior species as there are 
various kinds of dogs horses and oxen 

genus and species have a reference to moral ideas as 
well as to physical ones thus we may say industry is a 
virtue frugality is a virtue temperance is a virtue this 
shows that virtue is a genus and that frugality industry 
and temperance are its species

sake the relation of genus and species you must always 
remember that while a genus may be divided into speciea 
each species may again be subdivided into individiials i 
use these words genus and species being words in common 
use to express the general idea of classification the word 
genus denotes a large class — the word species a small class

 the rules for dividing a genus into its species are 
similar to those for dividing a whole into its parts a 
species is part of a genus 

 each part singly taken must contain less than the whole but 
all the pahs taken collectively or together must contain neither 
more nor less than the whole or as logicians sometimes express 
it the parts of the division ought to exhaust the whole thing 
which is divided 

 in all distributions we should first consider the larger and 
more immediate kinds or species or ranks of being and not 
divide a thing at once into the more minute and remote 

the several parts of a distribution ought to be opposite that 
is one species or class of beings in the same rank of division 
ought not to contain or include another so men ought not to be 
divided into the rich the poor the learned and the tall for poor 
men may be both learned and tall and so may the rich 

let not subdivisions be too numerous without necessity 
therefore think quantitv is better distinguished at once into a 
hne a surface and a solid than to say as ramus doe that 
quantity is either a line or a thing lined and a thing lined is 
either a surface or a solid 

 distribute every subject according to the special design you 
have in vie so far as is necessary or useful to your present in 
quiry thus a politician distributes mankind according to their 
civil characters into the rulers and the ruled and a physician 
divides them into the sick or the healthy but a divine distri

 it is to this doctrine of distribution of a genus into its several 
species we must also refer the distribution of a cause according 
to its several effects as some medicines are heating some are 
coolinj or an effect when it is distinguished by its causes as 
faith is either built upon divine testimony or human it is to 
this head we refer particular artificial bodies when they are dis

is either of brass of marbl or wood g and any other beings 
when they are distinguished according to their end and design as 
the furniture of body or mind is either for ornament or use to

 the mode of reasoning from genus and species is 
merely to show that a certain species is properly claajsed 
imder a certain genus and then to affirm or deny of the 
species what you may affirm or deny of the genus 

• thus you may say all fruit is useful to health the 
apple is a kind of fruit therefore the apple is useful to 
hth i may observe that this principle of reasoning 
from genus to species is the only kind of reasoning in 
which you gain anything by placing it in the form of a 
syllogism and here mind the argument gains nothing 
in point of strength but sometimes it gains a little in point 
of clearness or at least it gives a clearer statement of the 
meaning of the reasoner 

the following are the examples given in the logic of 
dr watts — 

 every wicked man is truly miserable 

all tyrants are wicked men 

therefore all tyrants are truly miserable 

he thats always in fear is not happy 
 covetous men are always in fear 

therefore covetous men are not happy 

whatsoever furthers our salvation is good for us 

some afflictions further our salvation 

therefore some afflictions are good for us 

 this is the principle of the first figure of syllogistic reasoning or as mr 
bailey calls it class reasoning the maxim is whatever is predicated 
universally of any class of things may be predicated in like manner of anything 
comprehended in that class— see sailey p

osnus and speib 

nothing that must be repented of is truly desirable 
some pleasures must be repented of 
therefore there are some pleasures which are not truly 
desirable 

here you will observe that in the first iuogism the 
genus is every wicked man — that is all wicked men 
— and the species all tyrants 

in the second syllogism he thats always in fear is 
the genus and covetous man is the species under that 
genus 

in the third syllogism whatever furthers our salva 
tion is the genus and some afflictions is the species 

in the fourth syllogism nothing that must be repented 
of is the genus and some pleasures is the species 

in natural logic we need not use these syllogisms we 
should in the above cases express our reasons in the 
following manner — 

all tyrants are truly miserable because they are wicked 
men 

covetous men are not happy because they are always 
in fear 

some afflictions are good for us because they further 
our salvation 

some pleasures are not truly desirable because they 
must be repented ofl 

 the application of a general principle to a particular 
case is another mode of reaboning from the relation of 
genus and species

 in the application of general proverbs we reason from 
the relation of genus and species 

thus honesty is the best policy therefore when a 
public company has sustained losses it is the best policy to 
announce them in its annual report to the shareholders as 
that is the most honest procedure this is one of the 
numerous cases to which this maxim may be apphed dr 
franklin describes several specific characters under the 
genus that they paid too dear for their whistle and in 
daily life we meet with people to whom is applied the 
maxim that they have too many irons in the fire or 
that they carry too many eggs in one basket or that 
 they are penny wise and pound foolish in these cases 
the proverb is regarded as the genus and the particular 
case to which it is apphed is the species this will appear 
the more evident if placed in the form of a syllogism 

it is unwise to have too many irons in the fire 

the man who carries on more trades than he can attend 
to has too many irons in the fire 

therefore the man who carries on more trades than he 
can attend to acts unwisely 

 eules and examples in any art or science sustain the 
relation to each other of genus and species

or more nouns joined together in the manner stated we 
apply the rule and if we find that the yerbs nouns and 
pronouns agreeing with them are put in the plural number 
we infer that the sentence is grammatical but if other 
wise we say the sentence is imgrammatical now then 
try by this rule the following sentences — socrates and 
plato were wise they were the most eminent philosophers 
of greece here the rule is observed and so was also 
james and john the sons of zebedee who were partners 
with simon here the rule is violated 

you perceive then that the application of any general 
tide to a particular case is a logical process and forms an 
argument on the principle of genus and species i may 
also observe that although in teaching an art systema 
tically we lay down our rules first and then give the 
examples yet in the practical opemtions of teaching espe 
cially in conversation it is usually best to state the example 
first and then state the rule as a deduction from the 
example indeed most general rules were probably in the 
first instance deduced from examples men did not invent 
grammar first and then learn to speak but speech existed 
before grammar the same remark may be appued very 
extensively poets existed before critics aiid the practical 
arts before the sciences

uniting the old and the new together in one testimony it 
declares that god who at sundry times and in divers manners

new testaments closing the canon of divine truth it solemnly 
affirms all scripture is given by inspiration of god and if any

 under this head of genus and species we may place 
reasoning from the definition 

the genus and the specific difierence as we have already 
stated are joined together to make a formal definition 
thus in the example quoted fiom dr watts at page 
juice is the genus and pressed from grapes the specific 
difierence and those together the juice of the grape is the 
definition of wine a definition formed in this way by the 
imion of the genus and the difference is called by scho 
lastic logicians a formal definition we cannot always 
obtain a definition of this kind but when we can do so we 
may reason fiom it in various ways 

we may infer that everything to which this definition 
will apply are so many species under this generic temi 
thus port sherry claret champagne being all juices of 
grapes are so many species of wine au subjects will 
not as we have said admit of this formal definition but 
you may generally commence your definition by stating 
the genus or general nature thus if asked what is justice 
you may say it is a moral virtue this is the genus 
and then you may state wherein it differs from other 
moral virtues as temperance cleanliness patience c 
and you may say justice is a moral virtue which consists 
in giving to every one his due so if you have seen the 
hippopotamus and are asked what sort of a thing it is 
you may say it is an animal that resembles a pig this is

ihd genus and then you may state the points wherein it 
differs from a pig and this will complete the description 
now having got a definition you may consider it as 
a species and aflrm of it what you may affirm of the 
genus thus having defined justice to be a moral virtue 
you may infer that it ought to be cultivated inasmuch as 
all the moral virtues ought to be cultivated then you 
may consider the definition as a general principle appli 
cable to individual cases and as sie specific difference of 
justice consists in giving to every one his due you will 
infer that a master who defrauds his servant of his wages 
a tradesman who cheats his creditors a slanderer who 
speaks ill of worthy men a magistrate who punishes the 
innocent or who lets the guilty go free does not act con 
sistently with justice as these parties do not give to every 
one his due 

but you must not be too precise about this matter of 
definition if your opponent is disposed to cavil he may 
easily find fvlt with any definition you can give even 
men of great talent and learning cannot agree among 
themsewes upon this subject the most eminent polir 
tical economists give different definitions of such plain 
words as capital profit rent wages — words that we use in

any difficulty or mystery about them sydney smith the

 we reason erroneously from the relation of genus 
and species when we place under the genus several species 
that do not belong to it and then assert of each species 
what may be truly asserted of the genus

society of friends publiihed a book entitled illustr 
tions of lying in au its branches under the class of

if we use the word liar in the sense in which it is usually 
employed the wearer of felse hair is not a species of that

genus a lie implies something immoral but we do not 
think it is immoral to conceal defects that are inconvenient 
to the party himself or that would be unpleasant to the 
beholders mrs opies argument stands thus — 

a liar is one who wishes to deceive he who wears 
false hair wishes to deceive therefore he who wears mse 
hair is a liarr 

we may refute this argument in the following ways — 
we may say that the words wishes to deceive hacve 
not the same meaning in the first or major proposition 
which they have in the second or minor proposition and 
hence the two propositions are independent of each other 
and they have no relation that can be a foundation for any 
reasoning respecting them see page 

or we may admit that in both propositions the words 
wishes to deceive have the same meaning but then 
they merely denote a common property — not a specific 
difference — and hence they do not prove that the two 
subjects are the same gold is yellow and safion is 
yellow but it does not follow that saffron is gold so in 
the present case the common attribute does not prove 
that the two subjects are the same see page 

or we may reduce the oonclusion to an absurdity thus 
— all liars shall have their portion in the lake that bums 
with fire and brimstone the man who wears false hair 
is a liar therefore the man who wears false hair shall 
have his portion in the lake that bums with fire and 
brimstone this conclusion shows the absurdity of the 
classification 

in actual life we often meet with erroneous classificar 
tions of this kind the words want of courtesy is a 
general term often unjustly applied to individual actions 
a person goes to transact some business at a public office 
and is detained much longer than he expeted he be 
comes irritated and declares he is treated with want of 
courtesy whereas the delay may have been occasioned 
by the necessary forms of the office or by his own igno 
rance of those forms when a servant for some trifling 
oversight is charged with neglect of duty it is a fellacy 
of the same kind the words neglect of duty is a

serious omisaons to apply it in trifling cases is to use 
it illogically whenever we wish to represent any act in 
its worst oolonrs we use generic terms of so wide a mean 
ing as to include several species of offences of a deeper 
dye than that we are called upon to censure and on the 
other hand when we wish to extenuate we employ generic 
terms that shall include only offences of a lighter hue 
all these are fallacies arising from erroneous classification 
similar to that we have exemplified from mrs opie 

 we must also avoid the error of confounding two 
or more species hecause they helong to the same genus 

thus when we find that two species resemhle each other 
in some respects which of coiuse they always must o 
we should not infer that they resemble each other in all 
respects for example — 

 he that says you are an animal sayp true he that 
bays you are a goose says you are an auunal therefore he 
that says you are a goose says true here the two pre 
mises are true and yet the conclusion is absurd it is true 
that you are an animal and that a goose is an animal and 
yet it is not true of course i mean hterally that you are 
t goose for you and the goose belong to different species 
and although you resemble each other so for as to be 
properly classed under the same genus animal yet you 
cannot be asserted to be each other so dog horse camel 
elephant are species of animal but a dog is not a horse 
nor is a camel an elephant 

in the case of the genus animal we are not in much 
danger of falling into error but we meet with similar errors 
elsewhere i have read a debate in the house of commons 
in which unitarians were called mahometans both these 
bodies agree in disbelieving the doctrine of the trinity 
but under this generic description they form two widely 
different species and one cannot logically be confounded 
with the other you will often observe this practice in 
party writers they will class the party against whom 
they write with some other party tfiat has a disreputable 
name and confound them both together under some generic 
description 

 in reasoning on this principle we should always be 
on our guard agaiost mere mental classifications i mean

such as exist only in the mind and not in the nature of 
the things themselves the following qiiotation from dr 
watts will explain what i mean 

i may borrow a remarkable instance for my purpose ahnost 
out of every garden which contains a variety of plants in it 
most or all mants agree in this that they have a root a stalk 
leaves buds blossoms and seeds but the gardener ranges them 
under very different names as though they were really different 
kinds of beings merely because of the different use and service 
to which they are apphed by men as for instance those plants 
whose roots are eaten shall appropriate the name of roots to 
themselves such are carrots turnips radishes c if the leaves 
are of chief use to us then we call them herbs as sage mint 
thyme if the leaves are eaten raw they are termed salad as 
lettuce pursbin if boiled they become potherbs as spinage 
coleworts and some of those plants which are potherbs in one 
family are salad in another if the buds are made our food they 
are called heads or tops so cabbage heads heads of asparagus 
and artichokes if the blossom be of most importance we call 
it a flower such are daisies tuhps and carnations which are 
the mere blossoms of those plants if the husk or seeds are 
eaten they are called the fruits of the ground as peas beans 
strawbemes c if any part of the plant be of known and 
common use to us in medicine we call it a physical herb as car 
duus bcurvygrass but if we count no part useful we call it a 
weed and throw it out of the garden and yet perhaps our next 
neighbour knows some valuable property and use of it he plants 
it in his garden and gives it the title of an herb or a flower 

 now when things are set in this clear light it appears how 
ridiculous it would be for two persons to contend whether dan 
delion be an herb or a weed wnether it be a potherb or a salad 
when by the custom or fancy of different families this one plant 
obtains all these names according to the several uses of it and 
the value that is put upon it 

a dispute somewhat similar to what is here intimated 
took place between mr maculloch and mr malthus upon 
the classification of lalourers into productive and unpro 
ductive mr malthus following adam smith applied the 
word productive to such labourers only whose exertions 
directly produced mtterial wealtl mr maculloch ex 
tended the word so as to include those also whose labour 
indirectly produced wealth hence arose the important 
question whether a dancer at the opera should be styled 
a productive or an unproductive labourer some good

oenus and bfecie 

paper and printing were expended in this wordy warre 
and after au it was only a dispute about classification for 
in other respects the antagonists did not differ in opinion 
this example may teach us to use caution in the choice 
of the words we employ to denote our classifications the 
words prodilctive and unproductive seem to convey praise 
and censure had other words been employed adam 
smiths distinction would not probably have been thought 
worthy of so much reproach 

 in reasoning firom this relation of genus and species 
we should carefully notice the kind of universality which 
is attributable to th genus for if the general proposition 
be taken in too extensive a sense the conclusion will be 
erroneous on this subject we quote dr watts — 

 universal terms may either denote a mathematical a physical 
or a moral luiiversauty 

 a mathematical universjility is when all the particulars con 
tained under any general idea nave the same predicate belonging 
to them without any exception whatsoever or when the predi 
cate is so essential to the universal subject that it destroys the 
very nature of the subject to be without it as all circles have 
a centre and circumference all spirits in their own nature are 
immortal 

 k physical or natural universality is when according to the 
order and common course of nature a predicate agrees to all the 
subjects of that kind though there may be some accidental and 
preternatural exceptions as all men use words to express their 
thoughts yet dumb persons are excepted for they cannot speak 
all beasts have four feet yet there may be some monsters with 
five or maimed who have but three 

a moral universality is when the predicate agrees to the 
greatest part of the particulars which are contained under the 
miiversal subject as all negroes are stupid creatures all men 
are governed by affection rather thwi by reason all the old 
bomans loved their country and the scripture uses this language 
when st paul tells us the cretes are always hars 

now it is evident that a special or singular conclusion cannot 
be inferred from a moral universality nor always and infallibly 
from a physical one though it may be always inferred from a 
imiversality which is mathematical without any danger or possi 
bility of a mistake 

• we fear mr bafley has committed an error of this kind in dividing reasoning 
toto demonstrative and contingent page in defiance of all explanation the 
mind will associate some degree of uncertainty with the word contingent

let it be observed also that usually we make little or no 
distinction in common lanuage between a subject that is physi 
cally or mathematically umversal 

you will find that some political economists lay down 
general propositions and reason from them as though they 
possessed a mathematical universality but from the 
nature of the science this cannot be the case it is a 
moral science and its general propositions have only a 
moral universality i mean that these rules have a good 
many exceptions for example one of its principles is 
that the government should not interfere with matters of 
trade — a very good rule as a general rule but when we 
are told that this rule is so inflexible that the government 
must not interfere even in behalf of humanity and religion 
then we contend that its advocates claim for this rule 
a imiversality to which it is not entitled in this sense 
we deny the soundness of the rule nay even those 
political economists who maintain most strongly this 
principle maintain at jthe same time that the govern 
ment ought to pass laws for the regulation of the currency 
— a subject with which trade has a very close affinity 

it is rarely that a mathematical universality can be 
obtained with regard to those propositions that we usually 
act upon in ordinary life we beueve that all noblemen 
have honourable and patriotic feelings — that all judges are 
impartial in their decisions — that all london merchants 
are honest in their dealings — that no clergyman wovdd tell 
an imtruth — that our fnends whose constancy we have 
tried will never desert us — that a man who has main 
tained a high reputation for thirty years will maintain it 
as long as he lives but we have only moral evidence 
for all these propositions and we can get no more he 
who in these and similar instances would refuse to act 
until he should obtain mathematical evidence would show 
a want of that wisdom and decision which are essential to 
the good administration of the afiairs either of a femily a 
commercial establishment or a political community 

 we may observe that all argimients formed on the 
relation of subject and attribute may also be brought 
under the relation of genus and species 

all subjects may be distributed into classes according to 



y google 



genus and species 

their attributes thus some horses are of a grey colour 
now we may consider grey as an attribute of the horses 
or we may consider grey horses as forming a class and our 
reasonings will be substantially the same though perhaps 
changed in regard to form let us take an example from 
dr watts — 

 no liar is fit to be believed 

every good christian is fit to be believed 

therefore no good christian is a liar 

here the words fit to be believed express an attri 
bute and as this attribute will not apply to both the 
subjects we infer that these subjects are different see 
page 

but let us suppose that these words fit to be believed 
denote a class then the argument will stand thus — 

 no man who is fit to be believed is a liar 
every good christian is fit to be believed 
therefore no good christian is a liar 

here fit to be believed denotes a class of persons and 
a good christian is one of that class 
let us take another instance of a different kind — 

 whosoever loves god shall be saved 
all the lovers of god have their impjerfections 
therefore some who have imperfections shall he saved 

here we consider shall be saved and have their 
imperfections as denoting attributes and as these attri 
butes belong to the same subject we infer they are not 
incompatible with each other see page but we may 
put the argument in a different form we may consider 
the words lovers of god as denoting a class or genus 
and some who have imperfections as a species under 
that class the reasoning would then stand thus — 

 all the lovers of god shall be saved 
some who have imperfections are lovers of grod 
therefore some who have imperfections shall be saved 

 so arguments founded on the principle of cause and 
eflfect may be brought under the principle of genus and 



one of the examples taken firom dr watts will exem 
plify this some afflictions are good for us because they

 logic for the million 

fuiiiier our sajvation here we have evidently cause and 
effect and this in fact is the best mode of stating the 
aigument but in the syllogism dr watts makes a claab 
of all those things that further our salvation and then 
some auctions become a subordinate class under that 
laiger classy a species under a genus 

whatsoever furthers our salvation is good for ua 
some affictions further our salvation 
therefore some afflictions are good for us 
again a good education is highly valuable for it 
softens the manners and ameliorates the dispositions of 
the heart here is the relation of cause and effect but 
a scholastic logician would not be satisfied with the aigu 
ment in this form but would turn it into genus and 
species this is done by making the effect a genus and 
the catlse a species thus — 

 everything that softens the manners and ameliorates 
the disposition of the heart is highly valuable 

but a good education softens the manners and amelio 
rates the dispositions of the heart 

therefore a good education is highly valuable 

you will observe that this relation of genus and species 
does not strengthen your argument it rather wikens 
it or at least it widens the field of objection an 
opponent might deny your first proposition he might 
say i do not admit that everything that softens the 
manners and ameliorates the disposition of the heart u 
highly valuable for there are some things that produce 
these effects but at the same time produce other effects of 
a dangerous character such things for instance it might 
be said are theatrical exhibitions here you see a new 
field of argumentation is at once thrown open had you 
stuck to your original principle of cause and effect you 
would have been on safer ground it is never advisable 
in argumentation to put yourself in a position to be called 
upon to prove the affirmative of a universal proposition 
if a single exception can be adduced your proposition is 
refuted and your argument is overthrown 

it is generally best to argue from those principles of 
reasoning which arise from the relation of the things

themselves aii not to attempt by mere verbal changes 
to bring your reasonings under a different principle you 
should be on your guard against this practice lest you fell 
into that istem of scholastic logic which refers only to the 
use of words and leaves unnoticed the nature of things 



section iv 

the relation op cause and effect — physical causes 

the kelation of cause and effect is a principle of exten 
sive itse in the art of reasoning but as causes are of 
various kinds we must consider them separately in dif 
ferent sections and in this section we shall confine our 
attention to those causes that refer to material substances 
and are consequently styled physical we shall in the 
subsequent sections consider those causes that are morale 
conditional and final we may observe with regard to 
these four kinds of causes — physical moral conditional 
and final — the first has reference to the physical sciences 
as botany physiology geography chemistry fec the 
second has a reference to the sciences of politics and 
political economy the third has a reference to jurispru 
dence and the affairs of ordinary life the fourth has a 
reference to ethics and theology we do not mean an 
exclusive reference but a general reference 

 the first class of causes we call physical causes to 
tins class of causes we refer all those effects which are pro 
duced by the uniform and necessary operations of nature 
thus it is an established law of nature that the earth 
shotild move roimd the sun and that the moon should 
move roimd the earth all the phenomena which result 
from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies are the result 
of natural causes it is a law of nature that all bodies on 
the earth should tend towards the centre and that dif 
ferent kinds of matter whether fluid or solid should have 
certain properties and that some of them should have an 
aflsnity for each other hence all reasonings connected 
with astronomy mechanics chemistry and the oljier

branches of experimental philosophy are founded on 
natural causes the reasonings founded on this class of 
causes amount to demonstration the cause necessarily 
and invariably produces the eflfect the following are 
examples —

the hills they give dnsk to every heast of the field the wild 
asses quench their thirst by them the fowls of the heaven have

 the benefits arising from the loinds are almost innumerable 
they purify the air moderate the heat dry wet lands and damp 
houses chase away the fogs and hazy weather and bring us rain 
in due season also frost and snow and even mild weather 
they are particularly serviceable for navigation and commerce 
when the air is so full of heavy vapours tliat it can no longer 
sustain them then these small moist particles run together and 
fall down in fine drops which we call rain the rain descending 
in drops is a further manifestation of divine wisdom for if it 
fell in strong streams it would injure the earth by washing away 
its fine light mould from the roots and seeds of plants and we 
should suffer great inconvenience fixm it — jqycet catechism

the annual overflowif of the nile is caused by the periodical 
rains in ethiopia the river begins to rise in the latter end of 
june and attains its utmost height about the middle of august 
when egypt presents the appearance of a vast sea while the cities 
and towns appear like so many islands after this the waters 
gradually subside and about the end of november the river has 
returned to its ordinary limits during this period the earth or 
mud which the waters held in solution has fallen on the soil 
and on the retiring of the waters the whole land is covered with 
a rich manure and according to herodotus required so little 
cultivation that in some cases it was only necessary that the 
seed should be thrown upon the surface and trodden down by 
pigs — lectures on ancient commerce 

 there are four ways of reasoning in regard to these 
physical causes first from the existence of the cause we 
may infer the existence of the effect if the sun has arisen

we know it must be day if the eaith comes between the 
bun and the moon the moon will be eclipsed if a body of 
less specific gravity than water be thrown into water we 
know it will float if fire be applied to gunpowder an 
explosion will take place if the colours blue and yellow 
be mixed together they will produce a green if a man 
has had his head cut off we may infer that he is dead 
the second mode of reasoning is from the existence of 
the effect to infer the existence of the caitse all theories 
or systems are foimded upon this mode of reasoning we 
observe the appearances of nature and we endeavour to 
ascertain the causes which have produced them if we see 
an abundant harvest we may infer that the land is good 
the third mode of reasoning is from the nonexistence of 
the cause to infer the nonexistence of the effect in the 
deserts of arabia there is no rain consequently there can 
be no vegetation the fourth mode of reasoning is from 
the nonexistence of tlie effect to infer the nonexistence 
of the cause the streets are not wet therefore it cannot 
have rained recently 

upon the farther application of this principle to reason 
ing we quote dr watts — 

tliere is a system of beinffs round about us of which we our 
selves are a part which we cajl the world and in this world there 
is a course of nature or a settled order of causes effects antece 
dents concomitants consequences c from which the author of 
nature doth not vary but upon very important occasions 

where antecedents concomitants and consequents causes 
snd eifects signs and things sicnified subjects and adjuncts are 
necessarily connected with eacu other we may infer the causes 
m the effects and effects from causes the antecedents from 
the consequents as well as consequents from antecedents c 
and thereby be pretty certain of many things both past present 
and to come it is by this principle that astronomers can tell 
what day and hour the sun and moon were ecupsed five hundred 
jears ago and predict all future eclipses as long as the world 
aiiall stand they can tell precisely at what minute the sun rises 
or sets this day at pequin in china or what altitudes the dogstar

not far off if we behold a tree groving on the earth we know it 
has naturally a root under ground 

where there is a necessary connexion between causes and 
effects antecedents and consequents signs and things signified 
we know also that like causes will have like effects and propor 
tionable causes will have proportionable effects contrary causes 
will have contrary effects and observinff men may form many 
judgments by the rules of similitude and proportion where the 
causes effects c are not entirely the same 

 where there is but a robable and uncertain connexion be 
tween antecedents concomitants and consequents we can give 
but a conjecture or a probable determination if the clouds 
gather or the weatherglass sinks we suppose it will ram if a 
man spit blood freauently with coughing we suppose his luns 
are hurt if very dangerous symptoms appear we expect his 
death 

 we are in danger of false reafioning when we ascribe 
effects to wrong causes 

thus for many ages the appearances of the celestial 
bodies were ascribed to their motion round the earth 
whereas it has since been demonstrated that these effects 
could not be produced by such a cause the french 
philosopher des cartes imagined certain whirlpools in 
the atmosphere by which he attempted to account for the 
appearances of nature thunder and lightning earth 
quakes and volcanoes are effects which have been ascribed 
to a variety of causes according to the hypotheses of 
different philosophers the flux and reflux of the tide 
the origin of rivers the phenomena of electricity and 
many other appearances connected with natural philo 
sophy have furnished curious specimens of fiilse reasoning 
in assigning causes 

 i would make thi matter a little plainer still by instances 
borrowed fixm the peripatetio philosophy which was mce taught 
in all the schools the nrofessor fancies he has assigned the true 
reason why all heavy boaies tend downward why amber will draw 
feathers or straws and the loadstone draw iron when he teus you 
that this is done by certain gravitating and attractive qualities 
which proceed from the substantial forms of those various bodies 
he imagines that he has exphdned why the loadstones north pole 
shall repel the north end of a magnetic needle and attract the 
south when he affirms that this is done by its sympathy with one 
end of it and its antipathy against the other dad whereas in

tnitli all these names of sympathy antipathy suhstantial forms 
and qualities when they are put for the causes of these effects 
in bodies are but hard words which only express a learned and 
pompous ignorance of the true cause of natural appearances 

writers on metaphysics have also adopted theories cal 
culated to weaken our confidence in the relation of physical 
causes and effects the most remarkable of these writers 
is bishop berkeley — since he asks the mind does not 
perceive physical objects but merely the images of those 
objects formed in the eye how do you know that any such 
objects exist to this we may reply that the representa 
tion formed in the eye is the effect of the external objects 
an is in itself a proof of their existence when we look 
at an object through a telescope we know that the object 
exists though we see only the image formed by the specu 
lum mr mill observes in his system of logic — 

i aflsrm that i saw my brother at a certain hour this morning 
if any pioposition concerning a matter of fact would commonly 
be said to be known by the direct testimony of the senses this 
surely would be so the truth however is far otherwise i 
only saw a certain coloured surface or rather i had the kind of 
visual sensations which are usually produced by a coloured sur 
face and from these as marks known to be such by previous 
experience i concluded that i saw my hrother milps logic 
tol ii p 

upon this theory we should suppose that as soon as 
an infant can recognise its mother it has begun to draw 
conclusions and has also had sufficient experience in the 
arts to know that a human body may be represented on a 
coloured surface 

to all theories of this description we may reply in the 
words of br watts — 

 though our senses are sometimes hable to be deceived yet 
when they are lightlv disposed and fitly exercised about their 
proper objects with the just assistance of reason they give us 
sufficient evidence of truth 

this may be proved by an argument drawn from the wisdom 
goodness faithfulness of ood our creator it was he gave us 
our senses and he would not make us of such a constitution as to 
be lis to perpetual deception and unavoidable error in using

these faculties of sense in the best manner we are capable of 
about those very things which are the proper objects of them 

 this may be proved ako by the ill consequences that would 
follow from the sunposition of the eontraty if we could have no 
certainty of the dictates of onr senses we could never be sure of 
any of the common affairs and occurrences of life men could 
not transact any of their civil or moral concerns with any cer 
tainty of justice nor indeed could we eat or drink walk or move 
with safety our senses direct us in all these 

again the matters of religion depend in some measure upon 
the certainty of the dictates of sense lot faith comes by hearing 
and it is to our senses that god appeals in working miracles to 
prove his own revelation now if when our eyes and ears and 
other organs of sense are rightly disposed ana exercised about 
their proper objects they were always liable to be deceived there 
could be no knowledge of the gospel no proof of divine revela 
tion by visions voices or miracles 

 to prove the connexion between a physical cause and 
its effects is not the province of reasoning but of obser 
vation and experiment 

during the middle ages the scholastic logicians treated 
the physical sciences in the way intimated by dr watts 
lord bacon first advocated the necessity of a different 
course soon afterwards the royal society for the im 
provement of natural science was establishec and itstretns 
actions were very influential to leading to a more accurate 
mode of ascertaining the causes of natural phenomena 

 but it must not be forgotten how much is due to lord 
bacon who died only thirtysix years before the incorpo 
ration of the royal society with a comprehensive and 
commanding mind patient in inquiry subtile in discrimi 
nation neither affecting novelty nor idolizing antiquity 
bacon formed and in a great measure executed his great 
work on the instaurcuion of the sciences which being 
clearly connected in its main features with the roysd 
society connects itself with our ixajuiry the design was 
divided into six capital divisions the first proposes a 
general survey of human knowledge and is executed in 
the admirable treatise the advancement of learning in 
this lord bacon critically examines the state of learning 
in its various branches at that period observes and points 
our defects and errors and then suggests proper means for 
supplying omissions and rectifying mistakes

 the second and the most considerable part is the

as a mere instrument of disputation and putting no trust 
in the hypothetical systems of ancient phuosophy recom 
mends the more slow but more satisfactory method of 
induction wiiich subjects natural objects to the test of 
observation and experience and subdues nature by experi 
ment and inquiry it will be seen how rigidly the early 
fellows of the boyal society followed bacons advice 

 whilst the memory of this great man was cherished 
and the spirit of his philosophy abroad the establishment 
of the royal society was accomplished a great number 
of eminent men existed at that period in england nearly 
all of whom weie warmly interested in the progress of 
science and it thus only required the cessation of domestic 
troubles to cause their attention to be turned to experi 
mental philosophy 

in the year the royal society obtained a charter 
of incorporation from charles ii the following is an 
extract from the preamble — 

 and whereas we are well informed that a competent 
number of persons of eminent learning ingeniity and 
honour concording in their inclinations and studies towards 
this employment have for some time accustomed them 
selves to meet weekly and orderly to confer about ike

and correct tmcertain theories in philosophy and by their 
labours in the disquisition of nature to prove themselves 
real benefactors to mankind and that they have already 
made a considerable progress by divers useful and remark

onr royal vour patisonage and all due encouragement 
to this illustrious assembly and so beneficial and laudable 
an enterprise — history of the royal society hy c r weld 

it has been asserted that the incorporation of the

to form theories without investigating the fiacts was the 
method of the aristotelian philosophy to ascertain the 
facts first by experiment was the method introduced and 
recommended by lord bacon

of cattle inasmuch as these cattle become unfit for food 
we think these complaints have no soud foundation the 
cattle are not fattened for food they are fattened to teach 
the art of fettening and whether these few cattle thus 
fiittened to excess should be eaten or not is a matter of 
little importance as compared with the practical know

diflferent constitutions there is much need of sound rea 
soning but after all the result is the only test of medical 
skill the surest proof of good treatment is the recovery 
of the patient 

homoeopathy must likewise be tested by experiments 
the homoeopathists contend that every disease has a specific 
remedy this remedy wiu cure the disease with as much 
certainty as bark cures ague or as acids cure scurvy they 
say they have discovered all these specific remedies this 
is the ftmdamental principle of the system the doctrine 
of small doses is subordinate they say that by tritura

small dose will have a greater effect than a larger dose 
which has not undergone this operation these are the 
two main principles of homoeopathy their truth must be 
proved by experiment not by reasoning but reasoning 
may be useful in deciding on the best ways of making the 
experiments 

the relation between physical causes and effects is first 
proved by observation and experiment having ascer 
tained thifif we employ reasoning for the purpose of apply

 with rard to moral causes we may adopt the fol 
lowing modes of reasoning 

first from the existence of the cause we may infer the 
existence of the effect thus if a man be industrious we 
may infer that he will get rich if a man be given to 
intoxication we may infer that he will reduce himself to 
beggary if a man exercise his intellectual faculties we 
know he will improve them 

secondly from the existence of the effect we may 
infer the existence of the cause thus if a servant enjoy 
in a high degree the confidence of his master we may infer 
that he has served him well if a man be involved in 
debts which he is imable to pay we may infer that he has 
been either imprudent or unfortunate 

thirdly from the nonexistence of the cause we may 
infer the nonexistence of the effect thus if a man has 
not been unfortunate nor improvident we may argue that 
he cannot be poor 

fourthly prom the nonexistence of the effect we may 
infer the nonexistence of the cause thus we may say 
such a person is not poor he cannot then have been 
extravagant such a person is not an intelligent man be 
cannot then have spent much time in reading and study 
he does not speak correctly therefore he cannot have 
learned grammar on one occasion when speaking to the 
vorking classes rowland hill observed — i dont think 
much of that mans religion who is without his sunday 
coat when a good providence gives him plenty of work — 
sherman 

 in the relation of moral causes and effects we have 
generally in the first instance to prove by reasoning that 
such a relation exists 

if for instance i contend that education produces good 
morals and hence ask my neighbours to assist me in esta 
blishing a school for the poor — i may be aked to prove 
in the first instance that education does produce good 
morals for imless i can prove the relation of cause and 
effect in this case my efforts will be unavailing so in 
many of the acts of ordinary life and in nearly all our 
public proceedings whether a certain cause will produce a 
certain effect is in feet the whole question in dispute

moral causes 

in reasoning upon motsl causes we are exposed to much 
difficulty from the circumstance that one effect is often 
produced by a vainly of causes 

the greatest sophistry arises from imputing to one par 
ticular cause an effect which results from the joint opera 
tion of m£uiy causes thus the ruin of an individual may 
be the consequence of the accidental burning of his house 
of imprudent cohduct of the treachery of friends and of 
robbery by thieves the fell of a stsu may be the effect 
of the imited operation of a tyrannical govelnment a sedi 
tious people the encroachments of a foreign enemy and 
pestilence and femine now should a person take the 
effect and argue that it was produced solely by one cause 
he would be in error 

we shall also fall into error if we deny the existence of 
any one cause because other catises contrihiued to prodiice 
the effect 

thus it has been contended that sir robert peels act 
for regulating the currency passed in the year was 
a cause of the commercial distress that occurred in the 
year in reply it was contended that the distress 
of was produced by the famine in ireland and the 
speculations in railways now this is no refutation of the 
former opinion for all the three causes may have united 
in producing the same effect 

we should also fall into error were we to infer that of 
two events one is the cause of the other merely because it 
occurred first in the order of time 

this mlacy is often ridiculed by a reference to the 
building of tenterden steeple being the cause of the good 
win sands the story is told i believe by bishop latimer 
there was a time when the goodwin sands which he in 
the neighbourhood of dover did not exist sometime 
after they had collected government commissioners were 
appointed to ascertain the cause they accordingly pro 
ceeded to the spot to examine witnesses among others 
an old man assured them that the cause of the goodwin 
sands was the building of the tenterden steeple they 
asked him how this could be he stated he could not 
tell how but he knew it was so for he recollected that 
when there was no steeple there were no sands but soon

after the building of the steeple in came the sands he

we shall give an example of the way in which this allu 
sion is applied 

the following argument is taken fixm the sophisms 
of free trade by a barrister 

 all great manuaeiures had their origin in the protective 
wttem take our own the greatest and least sicdy of any 
all onr own mannfactures took their rise in a system of protective 
duties so high as to amount to prohibitions in addition to this 
owing to the fearful hostilities that raged in europe for nearly 
a quuier of a century before we enjoyed a further acci 
dental monopoly of the manufacturing inaustiy of the world 
and this stringent protection has not only created manufactures 
hut created them where thev would not naturally have existed in 
spite of great natural disaavantages other nations have cotl 
and iron ore as well as we the united states are even richer 
in this respect but other nations have also what we have not 
they have native raw materials it has been justly observed that 
great britain is singularly poor in the raw materials which con 
stitute the basis of the greater jortion of her manufacturing in 
dustry we have no cotton no silk no fine wool even our best 
iron tor the manufacture of hardware comes from sweden our 
oils gums colours woods from the ends of the earth 

 next to us in manufacturing industry is france her 
manufacturing industry though still inferior to ours has never 
theless since the peace augmented in an even greater ratio but 
under strict and jealous protection — sophisms of free trade by 
a barrister 

the following reply is taken from free trade and its 
socalled sophiinns 

 there is no doubt that until recently the governments of 
almost all countries considered that the way to establish an 
industry and make it prosper was to protect it and conse 
quently whenever an industry flourishes simultaiieously with 
the existence of protection a great shout of triumph is raised as 
if the former were dependent on the latter — the old fallacy of 
post hoe ergo propter hoe it is only necessaiy to refer to the 
wellknown case of tenterden steeple and the loodwin sands for 
an illustration— jfvw trade and its socalled sophisms 

the reader will obserre that the barristers argument 
with regard to manufactures is that in several countries 
protection preceded prosperity and he infers that po

tection was the cause of prosperity his opponent replies 
that though protection preceded prosperity it was not the 
cause of probperity the two fects haying no more relation 
to each other than tenterden steeple and the goodwin sands 

in order to prove that two events sustain the relation 
to each other of cause and efifect it is necessary to show 
first that ike two events did actually occur secondly that 
the event which we call the cause occurred in the order 
of time before the effect and thirdly that there was an 
adaptation in the cause to produce the effect in refutation 
we may state that one or both of the two events did not 
occur— or that they did not occur in the order of time — 
or that there was no adaptation in the one to produce the 
other we may go further and maintain that the alleged 
cause so far from being the cause was an obstruction to 
the effect the words in spite of are sometimes used 
on such occasions gentlemen i contend that trade did 
not prosper in consequence of protection but that it pro 
spered in spite o protection 

 public measures are usually approved or condemned 
on acpoimt of the effects they are alleged to produce 

here is a de field for controversy the afifeirs of a 
nation are so multifiarious so many causes are perpetually 
at work that it is difficult to trace with certainty the pre 
cise effects of any one cause even after measures have 
become law and we have had some experience of their opera 
tion the same difference of opinion is still maintained if 
a measure aheady adopted is applauded on accoimt of the 
good effect it has produced we may contend in opposition 
to this that the event called the effect has not taken 
place— or admit that the event has taken place but was 
not the effect of that cause or we may go ftirther and 
admit that the event was the effect of the cause but that 
the effect was a bad effect or we may go still further 
and admit that the effect was a good effect and then 
contend that the same cause produced other effects of 
a different character so that the bad consequences more 
than counterbalanced the good ones

stances sustain the relation of cause and effect tvhich is the 
cause and which is the effect

heretofore the landlords have been aooused of keeping 
up the price of com by demanding high rents but dr 
chalmers observes that there is no sounder principle in 
political economy than that the high prices of com are not 
the effect but the cauu of high rents the country bankers 
were accused of causing a general rise in prices by an ex 
cessive issue of their notes but they stated in reply that 
it was not the increased issue of notes that caused the high 
prices but the high prices called out the notes 

 the error of the ricardo system of jolitical economy on the 
snbject of rent has been weu characterised by mr t rerronet 
thomson as the fallacy of inversion it confounds the effect 
with the cause it is not because of the existence of inferior 
soils that the superior pay a rent but it is because the superior 

say a rent that the inferior are taken into occupation there 
oes not occur to us any logical term by which to denominate the 
fallacy that is now under consideration but it is not less a fallacy 
notwithstanding — br chalmers 

if the effect may have been produced by several causes 
and we can prove the absence of all the caitses except oncy 
this fixes the effect upon that one cause we take the 
following extract from the report of the general board of 
health on the supply of water to the metropolis — 

 with respect to this case of botherhithe the fact of the 
people in the nrst street mentioned having been the first victims 
m the great outbreak shows that they must have been highly 
predisposed and as they lived in decent houses and were in 
comfortable curcumstances two of the more ordinary causes of 
the disease— overcrowdiag and poverty — could not have operated 
those considerations can leave no doubt tiai the one main cause 
of the mreat severity of the attack was the use for domestic pur 
poses l polluted thames water 

in investigating the relation of cause and effect it is 
sometimes advisable not to stop at the immediate causes 
but to go further back and ascertain whai are the original 
catues of that immediate cause it has been disputed 
whether the price of food has any influence on the rate of 
wages it hias been answered no for the rate of wages 
is regulated by the proportion between the demand for 
labour and the supply admitting the latter opinion to 
be correct it does not refute the former for the demand

and the supply of labour are influenced by anterior causes 
and the price of food may be one of those anterior causes 
so we are told that the rate of interest is regulated by the 
proportion that may exist between the demand and the 
supply of capital this throws but little light upon the 
matter imless we are told at the same time what are the 
anterior causes that regulate this demand and this supply 
if it be a matter of dispute whether two events sustain 
the relation of cause and eflfect we may be able to solve 
the diflculty if it is found that the revnoval of the supposed 
cause is followed hy the removal of the supposed effect 

 there was the case of a man who lived in the coburffroad in 
camberwell parish in a semidetached house in a healtny situa 
tion and with a garden behind the premises his wife had noticed 
that the water supplied to them was exceedingly bad and having 
been informed that it was likely to affect the health of her family 
she invariably boiled and filtered it all kept in perfect health 
except the father who objected to drink this water from its 
being flat and nnaerated he would still drink it as it came from 
the waterbutt and the consequence was that he was attacked 
with choleraicdiarrhcea he afterwards drank no more of it and 
got toell— report of the board of health 

thus it was disputed whether the act of for regu 
lating the currency was the cause of the monetary pressure 
of but it was found that when the act was suspended 
in october the pressure immediately ceased a 
writer on this subject observes — it has been denied that 
this pressure was produced or increased by the act but 
how stand the facts the act was passed and as pre 
dicted a pressure came — the act was continued and the 
pressure increased — the act was suspended and the pres 
sure went away these are not opinions — they are fects 

in reasoning upon moral causes and effects we should 
inquire whether at all times and under all circummances 
llie same causes will produce precisely the same effects 

we often meet with cases of this kind in the consider 
ation of historical and international questions thus it fs 
fiaid the woollen manufecture in england and the linen 
manufacture in ireland prospered in consequence of pro 
tective laws and therefore the same laws would cause in

sometimes we meet with zealous advocates who reduce 
their own principles to an absurdity hy deducing from

dr chalmers adopted the malthusian theory of popu

legitimate conclusions that his readers were led to doubt 
the soundness of the theory they judged of the tree by 
its fruits dr alexander of edinburgh in an address re 
specting recent events has pointed out a similar example 
in the conduct of some advocates of a popular principle — 

it is possible to drive a good horse to death it is equally 

sssible to drive a sound principle to weakness and contempt mr 
ouoways pills are we believe very fair and honest sort of

served in the same way with some people it seems the one 
truth for the age it is the grand religious catholicon — the 
panacea of piety — like the mistletoe of the druids a healall for 
the ills of the community we dread the effect of this indiscreet 
advocacy on the minds of the nation at lare we fear that it 
will retard rather than promote the cause of voluntaryism we 
fear lest when men are incessantly told tliat it is good for every 
thing they will turn from it in disgust and hold it to be good 
for nothing 

k an absurd conclusion can be legitimately deduced 
from any general principle itu a sufficient proof that the 
principle is unsound but in this case we should careftdly

 akin to the reduction ad abturdvm is an exposure 
of the fallacy called proving too much 

this fedlac j is an argument that if admitted to proye the 
point in dispute would if carried nrf to all its intimate 
consequences also jyrove other pointi that neither of the dis 
ptuants admit to be true 

as an example of proving too much we may adduce 
all the arguments that go to prove the impropriety of 
closing the postoflces throughout the country on the 
sunday for if these arguments prove the point in regard 
to provincial towns they also prove the propriety of 
opening the postoflce on sunday in london but if the 
argument foils when applied to london then d fortiori 
it must be inconclusive when applied to a country town 
this argument can be resisted only by showing that there 
are peculiar circumstances in the country which do not 
apply to london 

so the argument of mr cobden against granting loans 
to the emperor of russia proves too much for if it were 
immoral to lend money to the emperor because he might 
employ it in carrying on war against the hungarians then 
by parity of reasoning it would also be immoral to have 
any transactions with him by which his finances might be 
improved and hence all trade with russia should cease 
upon the same ground we ought to abstain from the use 
of sugar and cotton and all other commodities which are 
produced by the labour of slaves if by using them we 
increase the property of those who in defiance of all the 
principles of morality hold in bondage their fellowman

matlock and buxton imported from florence rome and other 
parts of italy specimens of the art which were seen and imitated 
by the workers of derbyshire until at leneth they are able to 
equal and in some respects surpass the proauctions of florence 
and if the small exhibition of matlock has been the means of 
producing an entirely new and beautiful art amongst the inha 
bitants of the peak of derbyshire what maj we confidently 
expect to residt from this great and mighty exhibition which in 
comparison to that at matlock is like the broad atlantic to a

the relation of cause and effect— conditional causes 

a conditional cause is a circumstance or state of things 
which is necessary to the production of an effect but 
which does not actively produce that eflfect 

thus if a man fsill from his horse it is a necessary con 
dition that he should previously have been on his horse 
otherwise he could not have fallen if a man is hanged 
for forgery the active or efficient cause of his being hanged 
is the commission of the crime but if he had never learned 
to write he coidd not have committed a forgery hence 
his knowledge of writing is a necessary condition 

as the condition does not thus actively or necessarily 
produce the effect we do not usually use the words con 
ditional cause and effect but we say the condition 
and the sign thus a physician feels the pulse of his 
patient to ascertain the state of his health the state of 
health is the condition the state of the pulse is the sign 
now a man may be in a bad state of health and yet his 
pulse may be regular the existence of the condition is no 
proof of the existence of the sign but if thq pulse be irre 
gular it shows that the health is disturbed the existence 
of the sign is a proof of the existence of the condition 

so it is a necessary condition to the performance of any 
act that the man who performs it should be alive now 
then if a will is produced of a date some years subse 
quent to the death of the alleged testator it proves that 
the will is a forgery the man might have been alive 
without making a will but he could not have made a will 
unless he had been alive the condition must have 
preceded the sign 

 this relation of condition and sign supplies us with 
various modes of reasoning 

from the nonexistence of the condition we infer the 
fionrexistence of the sign

qtuilifications instruments and opportunities are neoes 
sary conditions to the performance of any act if we 
prove the absence of these we prove the nonperformance 
of the act if a man has committed murder it is a neces 
sary condition that he should have been at the puice when 
the murder was committed and at the time tie murder 
was committed now if he can prove an cuihi this word 
is latin for elsewhere that i if he can prove that he was 
at a distant place at the time the murder was committed 
this proves that he did not commit the murder the non 
existence of the condition proves the nonexistence of the 
sign but you cannot reverse this rule the existence of 
the condition will not of itself prove the existence of the 
sign for he might have been at the place where and at 
the time when l£e murder was committed and yet might 
not have committed the murder it might have been com 
mitted by some of his companions 

again from the existence of the sign we infer the exists 
ence of the condition 

take the same instance if a man is proved to have 
committed a murder it proves the condition that he was 
at the place where and at the time when the murder was 
committed but if it is proved that he did not commit 
the murder that is in itself no proof that he was not 
present when the murder was committed the non 
existence of the sign is no proof of the nonexistence of 
the condition 

sometimes it is contended in fevour of a proposed 
measure that it is a necessary condition ie a conditional 
cause to some other measure of still greater importance 

thus the earl of shaftesbury advocated in the house of 
lords ihe establishment of lodging houses for the poor 
upon the ground that domestic coinfort is a necessary con 
dition to their intellectual and moral improvement 

 could their lordships suppose that these physical evils pro 
duced no mischievous moral consequences ele was sorry to 
have to inform them that they produced the most fatal and deadly 
consequences they generated habits of drinking — they led to 
the overthrow of decency every function of nature was per

any purpose j — there was no domestic education — nay education

br hamilton uses th same kind of argument in his 
sermon upon early closing the shops in london — 

vainly my friends shall we multiply the means of rational 
instnictioii if we do not shorten the hours of labour vainly 
shall libraries and readingrooms hold out their attractions and 
vainly shall popular lectures and polytechnic exhibitions keep 
open till late at night unless along with the lecture or the show 
we give the leisure to look and listen and vainly shall kind 
hearted tradesmen treat their hands to an occasional holiday 
eyening in order to visit some instructive sight or hear some 
appropriate address — unless the boon be prolonged and perpetua 
tecl unless time be afforded to follow up the study or drink 
agam the stream they have once tasted 

by a similar mode of reasoning we sometimes adduce 
 precept to prove a doctrine the truth of which seems 
a necessary condition to the justice of the command 
thus the commands of scripture to repent believe obey 
imply as a necessary condition that ihan has the power to 
repent believe and obey the threatenings of pimishment

bishop whately cites an injunctionf to almsgiving as a 
scriptural authority for the institution of property — 

 it is plain from this and from many other such injunctions 
of the apostles that they did not intend to destroy among chris 
tians the security of property which leads to the distinction be 
tween the rich and the poor for their exhortations to the rich 
to be kind and charitable to the poor would have been absurd 
if they isa not allowed that any of their people should be rich 
and tnere could be no such thing as charity in giving anything to 
the poor if it were not left to each mans free choice to give or 
spend what is his own indeed nothing can be called ycwr own 
which you are not left free to dispose of as you will the very 
nature of charity implies that it must be voluntary for no one 
can be properly said to pve anything that he has no power to 
withhold — easy lessons on money matters 

 you will observe that much erroneous reasoning has 
taken place from confounding the conditional with the 
active cause 

in cases where a number of causes some active and 
some only conditional conspire to produce the same effect 
it is not always easy to distinguish between the active and 
the conditional causes this difficulty is often experienced 
in the investigation of historical facts thus it has been 
said that the reformation was the cause of all the wars in 
germany in the fifteenth century the beformation was 
certainly a condition for if there had been no reformation 
there could have been no fighting about it but it was 
only the condition the active cause of those wars was the in 
terference of those hostile parties who would not allow the 
people to follow the convictions of flieir own judgments 

in the following argument the existence of the condition 
is insisted on as essential to the sign

 this principle of reasoning is used very extensively 
in the examination of evidence adduced in onr courts 
of law sometimes parties are accused of crimes to the 
perpetration of which there were no witnesses their guilt 
is inferred from the circumstances of the case this is 
called circumstantial evidence and sometimes pre 
sumptive evidence as the guilt is presumed from the cir 
cumstances adduced some lawyers have maintained that 
circumstantial evidence is more conclusive than direct 
evidence as there is no danger from the perjury of the 
witnesses but others have thought diflferentiy no certain 
rules can be given for circumstantial evidence each cause 
must depend upon itsee the reader will remember that 
within a short period several atrocious criminals have been 
convicted upon circimistantial evidence 

the following are some general remarks on this kind of 
evidence — 

 the force and efikt of circumstantial evidence depend 
upon its incompatibility with and incapability o explana 
tion or solution upon any other supposition than that of 
the truth of the fact which it is adduced to prove the 
mode of argument resembling the method of demonstra 
tion by the reductio ad ahsurdumj 

 these circumstances may be considered under the heads 
of— motives to crime— declarations indicative of inten 
tion — preparations for the conomission of crime — pos 
session of the fruits of crime — refusal to account for 
appearances of suspicion or imsatisfectory explanations 
of such appearances — evidence indirectly confessional — 
and the suppression destruction simulation and fabrica 
tion of evidence

 the principal fiicts of circumstantial evidence of ail 
external character relate to questions of identity — of 
person of things of handwriting and of 
time but there must necessarily be a number of isolated 
cts which admit of no more spific classification 

 since an action without a motive would be an effect 
without a cause a presumption is created in vour of in 
nocence from the absence of all apparent inducement to 
the commission of the imputed offence but the investi 
gation of human motives is often a matter of great diffi 
culty from their latency or remoteness and experience 
shows that aggravated crimes are sometimes committed 
from very slight causes and occasionally even without any 
apparent or discoverable motive this particular pre 
sumption would therefore seem to be applicable only to 
cases where the guilt of the individual is involved in doubt 
and the consideration for the jury in general is rather 
whether upon the other parts of the evidence the party 
accused has committed tiie crime than whether he had 
any adequate motive 

 since felsehood concealment flight and other like 
acts are generally regarded as indications of conscious guilt 
it naturally follows that the absence of these marks of 
mental emotion and still more a volimtary surrender to 
justice when the party had the opportunity of conceal 
ment or flight must be considered as leading to the 
opposite presumption and these considerations are fre 
quently urged with just effect as indicative of innocence 
but the force of the latter circumstance may be weakened 
by the consideration that the party has been the object of 
diligent pursuit it must be also remembered that flight 
and other similar indications of fear may be referable to 
guilt of another and less penal character than that involved 
in the particular charge 

 if it be proved that a party charged with crime has 
been placed in circumstances which commonly operate as 
inducements to commit the act in question— that he has 
so far yielded to the operation of those inducements as to 
have manifested the fisposition to commit the particular 
crime — that he has possessed the requisite means and 
opportunities of effecting the object of his wishes — that

recently after the commission of the act he has become 
possessed of the fruits ot other consequential advantages 
of the crime — if he be identified witu the corpus delicti 
by any conclusive mechanical circumstances as by the 
impressions of his footsteps or the discovery of any article 
of his apparel or property at or near the scene of the 
crime — if there be relevant appearances of suspicion con 
nected with his conduct person or dress and such as he 
might reasonably be presumed to be able to account for 
but which nevertheless he cannot or will not explain — if 
he be put upon his defence recefitly after the crime imder 
strong circumstances of adverse presumption and cannot 
show where he was at the time of its commission — if he 
attempt to evade the force of those circumstances of pre 
sumption by mse or incredible pretences or by endeavours 
to evade or pervert the course of justice by conduct in 
consistent with the supposition of his innocence — the con 
currence of all or of many of these cogent circumstances 
unopposed by fiicts leading to a coimter presumption 
naturally reasonably and satisctorily establishes the 
moral certainty of his guilt — if not with precisely the same 
kind of assurance as if he had been seen to commit the 
deed at least with all the assurance which the nature of the 
case and the vast majority of human actions admit in 
such circumstances we are justly warranted in adopting 
without qualification or reserve the conclusions to which 
by a brcmd general and comprehensive view of the facts 
and not relying upon minute circumstances with respect to 
which there may be some source of error the mind is thus 
naturally and inevitably conducted and in regarding the 
application of the sanctions of penal law as a mere corol 
lary nor can any practice be more absurd and imjust 
than that perpetuated in some modem codes which while 
they admit of proof by circumstantial evidence inconsis 
tently denies to it its logical and ordinary consequences — 
wurs jprmeiples of circumstantial jevidence 

it may be observed that the conclusiveness of circum 
stantial evidence does not depend upon the force of any one 
circumstance but upon the strength of the whole united 
if we see a man coming out of a house with blood on his 
dothea that is no proof that he has committed murder 



y google

there are many other ways in which his dress may have 
become bloody but if we enter the house and find there 
a person who has the appearance of having been recently 
murdered this causes the former individual to become 
suspected again you find the hat of this person in 
the house of the muidered man and when this person is 
apprehended he denies ever having been in the house 
and moreover you find concealed in his dress some pro 
perty proved to have belonged to the man who was 
murdered — now putting these and similar circumstances 
together you may have sufficient prpof of the prisoners 
giult for although you might eaoly assign other causes 
for any one of these circumstances separately you cannot 
assign sufficient causes to account for them all except on 
the supposition that the prisoner is the man who has com 
mitted the crime in cases of this kind the prisoners 
counsel exercises his ingenuity in assigning other causes to 
account for these criminating appearances and some 
barristers think themselves justified in doing this even 
after the prisoner has confessed his guilt lawyers of 
high standing have declared that such conduct is not in 
their judgment a violation of professional morality 

it must also be observed that if the circumstances 
brought in evidence against a prisoner can be accounted 
for on any other supposition than his guilt he is entitled 
to an acquittal the evidence must prove not merely 
that he inay be guilty but that he must be guilty the 
circumstances adduced must be wholly incompatible with 
the supposition that he is innocent and incapable of ex 
planation upon any other hypothesis than that of his 
guilt it is upon this kind of evidence that most crimi 
nals are convicted as crimes are usually committed in 
secret witnesses can rarely be obtained and circumstantial 
evidence is the only evidence that can be adduced and 
providence seems always to have arranged that all great 
crimes shall in this way be brought to light plans hatched 
with consummate ingenuity and in profoimd secrecy have 
in their execution been attended with some slight oversight

under this principle of reasoning we may class paleys 
hor€b patuince and similar works designed to prove the 
authenticity of the sacred writings this work of paley 
is confined to the consideration of the acts and the epi 
stles it does not attempt to prove they are genuine but 
to prove they are not forgeries the result is the same but 
the mode of reasoning is different it is presumed that 
some party has accused thse books of being forgeries 
and the reasoning is to show by circumstantial evidence 
that the accusation is not true the evidence is derived 
from the writings themselves and rests upon the inci 
dental coincidences that occur between thei acts of the 
apostles and the episties the following example is 
taken from paley — 

 in the acts of the apostles in the sixteenth chapter and at 
the first verse we are told that paul came to derbe and lystra 
and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the 
son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but 
his father was a greek in the epistle before us in the first 
chapter and at the fourth and fifth verses st paul writes to 
timothy thus greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of 
tliy tears that i may be filled with joy when i cau to remem 
brance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in 
thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am per 
suaded that in thee also here we have a fair imforced example 
of coincidence in the history timothy was the son of a jewess 
thai beheved in the gistle st paul applauds kb faith which 
dwelt in his mother eunice in the history it is said of the 
mother that she was a jewess and beheved of the either 
 that he was a greek now when it is said of the mother alom 
that she believed the father being nevertheless mentioned ia 
the same sentence we are led to suppose of the father that he 
did not beueve that is either that he was dead or that he re 
mained unconverted agreeably hereunto whilst praise is 
bestowed in the epistle upon one parent and upon her sincerity in

a new edition of paleys horce pavlvnm has recently 
been published by the beligious tract society with large 
additions by the rev t r birka late fellow of trinity 
collie cambridge we take the following example from 
mr birks — 

 tim iv the cloak that i left at troas with 
carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but 
especially the parchments 

 do thy diligence to come before winter 

 the deep and touching significance of this direction however 
trivial it may seem has been beautifully explained by mons 
gaussen in his theopneustia 

 during near thirtj years he had been poor in labours more 
abundant than others in stripes above measure bevond them in 
prisons more frequent than they of the jews he oad five times 
received forty atpes save one thrice he had been beaten with 
rods once stoned thrice shipwrecked in joumeyings often in 
perils at sea in towns in deserts among the heathen and among 
his own countrymen in watchings often in hunger and thirst in 
cold and nakedness with the care of all the churches he was 
now paul the aged and in his last prison at bome expecting the 
sentence of death and ready to be offered he had fought a good 
fight finished his course and kept the faith even his friends 
had shrunk from him on his first arraignment only luke was 
with him the rest had left or forsaken him the winter was about 
to set in and in the chilly dunns of bome he was in want of 
his cloak which he had left with carpus at troas two hundred 
leagues away the writer was himself in bome last year at the 
commencement of november and with what vivid realitv under 
the influence of the evening cold could he imagine the aged 
apostle in the dungeons of the capitol dictating the last of nis 
letters regretting the absence of his cloak and begging timothy 
to bring it before winter 

in another view these passages bear the same impress of 
reality the apostle had wintered at nicopolis joumeyea north 
ward early in the spring dismissed titus to dalmatia crossed 
macedonia by the egnatian way to neapolis and embarked for 
troas proceeded to miletus and in that neighbourhood been 
seized examined and sent off to bome from whence he writes 
to timothy in time for him to return but only with a speedy 
journey before winter sets in again from this outline deduced

is commanded by grod to get him to zarephath which belongeth 
to zidony and dwell there where a widow woman was to sustain 
him he goes finds the woman gathering sticks near the gate 
of the city and asks her to fetch him a little water and a morsel 
of bread she replies as the lord thy god liveth i have not 
a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a 
cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in

 this widowwoman then it seems dwelt at zarephath or 
sarepta which belongeth to zidon now from a passage in the 
book of joshua we learn that the district of jidon in the divi

moses blesses the tribes and see the character he gives of tins 
part of the countrv f asher he said let asher be blessed 
with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him 
dip his foot in oil indicatinff the future fertility of that region 
and the nature of its principal crop it is likely therefore that 
at the end of a dearth of three years and a half oil should be 
found there if anywhere yet this symptom of truth occurs once 
more as an ingredient in a miraculous history — for the oil was 
made not to fail till the ndn came the incident itsek is a very

the same coincidences are observable in the gospel his 
tories in every narrative observes paley we perceive 
simplicity and imdesignedness — the air and the language 
of reality when we compare the different narratives 
together we find them so varying as to repel all suspicion 
of confederacy so agreeing under this variety as to show 
that the accounts had one real transaction for their common 
foimdation often attributing different actions and dis 
courses to the person whose history or rather memoird of 
whose history they profess to relate yet actions and dis 
courses so similar as very much to bespeak the same charac

could only be the consequence of their writing from feet

acquired are of the utmost importance the circimi

of the sign we prove the existence of the condition or as

banker to have an ample knowledge of the means and 
transactions of his customers the customer when he opens 
his account will give him some information on this sub 
ject the banker will afterwards get information from his 
own books the amount of transactions that his customer 
passes through his current accoimt will show the extent of 
his business the amount of his daily balance will show if 
he has much ready cash the extent and character of the 
bills he offers for discount will show if he trust large 
amounts to individual houses and if these are respectable 
on the other hand the bills his customer may accept to 
other parties and his payments will show the class of 
people with whom he deals or who are in the habit of 
giving him credit another banker observes that next 
in importance to a study of his accounts the habits and 
character of a client are deserving of your attentive con 
sideration if a mans style of living for example becomes 
extravagant and he gives himself over to excess you can 
not too promptly apply the curb however regular the 
transactions upon his account may seemf 

now this is judging from circumstantial evidence by 
the same kind of evidence we are guided in our domestic 
adjudications in this mode of reasoning we judge of the 
honesty of our servants of the truthfulness of our children 
and of many other transactions connected with family 
discipline by this mode too we often judge of the sin 
cerity of our friends and of the character of public men 

 the scriptures furnish us with a good many instances 
of both right and wrong judgments founded on circum 
stantial evidence

relation of conditional cause and effect

antecedent and consequent the antecedent denotes what

 from the manifestation of certain attributes or qua

intellectual creatures 

 nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he

not the obvious answer to be found in that divme benevolence 
by which enjoyment is spread so largely over all life there can 
be no question of the resources of omnipotence man might 
have been formed with no more necessity for food than the flower 
but all know that food is capable of giving pleasure and by this 
daily necessity a general pleasure was constantly combined with 
existence 

 he who made the organs of nutrition might have adapted 
them to any food or any food to them or he might have made 
but one species of fooo or made that one repujbive and yet 
nutritious yet what is the reality p he has given us food in 
astonishing variety generally under forms of great beauty and 
universally pleasing to the taste but he has not merely diver 
sified the necessary subsistence of man and thus met the diversi 
fied climates of the globe but he has given luxuries unessential 
to the actual support of man the syrups of the east the spices 
of the south the rich fruitage of the west the refreshing pro

final aubbl 

ence is one very distingxuslimg circumstance in this comparison 
there is no other animal but man to whom mind appears to be 
given for any other purpose than the preservation of body— 
sydney smiths sketches of moral philosophy 

the following aigument from the relation of final cause 
and effect has been advanced in fiivour of sporting — 

 as natnre with a liberal bat not lavish hand has bestowed 
on her offspring those powers and propensities oidy which their 
own necessities or the general order and economy of the system 
require the gifts of scent to the hound swiftness to the grey 
hound and sagacity to the pointer denote the use which she 
intended man to mse of these animals and therefore the 
diversions in question are justifiable as fulfilling the intentions 
of nature herself — questions in political economy 

 it is a principle of moral philosophers that the final 
cause or motive of an action forms the moral character of 
the action 

that the moral quality of the action resides in the intention is 
evident from various considerations 

by reference to the intention we inculpate or exculpate 
others or ourselves without any respect to the happiness or 
misery actually produced let the result of an action be what 
 it may we hold a man guilty simply on the ground of intention 
or on the same ground we hold mm innocent thus also of 
ourselves we are conscious of ffuilt or of innocence not from 
the result of an action but from tne intention by which we were 
actuated 

we always distinguish between being the instrument of 
good and iutending it we are grateful to one who is the cause 
of good not in the proportion of the amount effected but of the 
amount intended 

as the right and wrong of an action reside in the intention 
it is evident that where an action is intended though it be not 
actually performed that intention is worthy of praise or blame 
as truly as the action itself provided the action itself be wholly 
out of our power thus god rewarded david for intending to 
build the temple though he did not permit him actually to build 
it so he who intends to murder another though he may fail to 
execute his purpose is in the sight of god a murderer the 
meditation upon wickedness with pleasure comes under the same 
condemnation 

as the right or vnrong exists in the intention wherever a 
particular intention is essential to virtuous action the perform 
ance of the external act without that intention is destitute of

 under this head of final cause and effect we may 
class those reasonings that are designed to prove the object 
or design of the laws of ancient nations 

montesquieus spirit of laws and michaeliss com 
mentaries on the laws of moses are full of reasonings of 
this description in cases when a legislator has not him 
self stated the object of his laws their design can he gcuhered 
only from a consideration of the nature of the enactments 
in connexion with the character of the people among whom 
they ere promulgated in his pamphlet on marriage 
with the sister of a deceased wife dr croly has made 
some striking remarks on the mosaic code 

the first years of the jewish people had been spent in con 
tact with syrian and arabian life a syrian ready to perish was 
thy father from this school of the harsnest and most prejudiced 
habits of the east they were eiven into the hands of the egyp 
tian the most subtle artificid and superstitious nation of the 
ancient world the jews in the course of four centuries 
naturally acquired the habits of both but when about to be 
formed mto a new nation in palestine the first step of their moral 
code was to purify the national spirit to extinguish all the evil 
that could be extmguished and to qualify all that loas beyond 
extinction 

the law of bloodrevenge appears to have been universal in 
western asia and arabia by this law the man ho killed 
another even by accident was to be slain by the next kinsman — 
the mosaic code without insisting on the abandonment of the 
custom provided six cities three on each side of the river jordan 
to which the homicide might flee and where he was secure until 
formal trial thus the principle was modified 

by an ancient oriental custom the creditor was entitled to 
sell the debtor — the mosaic code without disputing the right 
ordered that the bonaage of the debtor if aa israelite should not 
continue beyond the sabbatical year except by his own choice 
and that no israelite bondman should be sold into a foreign 
country thus the principle was modified

tolygamy was an established right throughout the eastrthe 
mosaic code interfered simply to forbid one of its freouent acts 
of injustice it ordered that the iidieritance of the earlier wifes 
offspring should be secured against the favouritism of the second 
or her offspring the principle was modified 

 slavery was retained — but a provision against its excess in 
numbers was enacted by the mosaic prohibitions of manstealing 
still so common among the nations of the south and of that 
cruelty which so generally marks the trade in man the master 
who killed his slave by an act of passion must be put to death 
even the lower degrees of injury were punished the loss of an 
eye or of a tooth by the masters violence entitled the slavib 
male or female to freedom the principle was modified 

 divorce was probably common in the earlier ages of syria aud 
arabia for it was always regarded as an essential privilege and 
in the more civilized times of palestine was still considered to be 
of so much imortance that even the disciples of our lord pro 
nounced its extinction a sufficient ground tor declining mamage 
altogether — in the mosaic code formalities and delays were en 
joined in practice which must have peatly restricted the custom 
and which at least softened the painful abruptness of divorce 
a period of three months must pass before the separation could 
be valid during which time the husband and wife were to be 
allowed the opportunity of reconciliation the principle was 
modified 

in all heathenism and of course in syria and arabia the 
father had the power of death over a rebellious child of a right 
so firmly established it might have been impossible to prevent the 
exercise — the mosaic code reduced the practice into an appeal 
to the public tribunals thus rescuing the son from the immecuate 
fury of the father ana giving his case over to impartial judg 
ment the principle was modified — marriage toith the sister of

 the doctrine of final causes enters largely into the 
administnition of the law 

sometimes this mode of reasoning is employed by the 
lawyers m fixing the meaning of an act of parliament 
our laws are made by the legislature but their meaning is 
fixed by the judges it sometimes happens that the word 
ing is uncertain or obscure and that one clause appears to 
contradict some other clause in these cases the judges 
inquire into the intention of the act that is the intention 
of the legislature in passing the act this intention is 
sometimes called the spirit of the act and when a clause 
has two meanings the judges will decide in favour of that

 looio for the ihllioit 

meaning which is most in conformity with the spirit of 
the act take for example the reform act passed in 
the intention of the act was to extend the privilege of 
toting for members of parliament in case therefore the 
meaning of any of the clauses should be doubtful that 
meaning which is most favourable to the extension of the 
privilege of voting for members of parliament is most in 
conformity with tiie spirit of the act if you watch the 
proceedings of the courts of law you will observe many 
cases illustrative of this kind of reasoning 

 in judicial cases also this principle of final causes is 
acknowledged 

from the effects of any motive the law infers the existence 
of the motive if a man commits murder the law as 
sumes that he intended to commit miurder so if a dozen 
persons who never saw each other before should join in 
 an illegal act they may be indicted for a conspiracy for 
their acting in concert will be considered as a proof of an 
intention to act in concert in the case of dr webster 
who was hanged at boston in fo for the murder of dr 
jparkman the following observations appeared in the lite 
vary world a paper published at new york — 

 suppose the facts as stated in the confession had been proved 
by a witness present on the spot but without the knowledge of 
the accused and then apply tne law as laid down by the chief 
justice and which we see no reason to question 

 in murder to escape the imputation of malice the prisoner 
must prove the provocation the accident or any other circum 
stance which goes to preclude the malice otherwise it is argued 
from the act itself no provocation of words however oppro 
brious will mitiffate the motive for a mortal blow or one intended 
to produce death where there is an intent to kill if there is 
sufficient provocation it is manslaughter but words are not a 
sufficient provocation malice is implieid from any deliberate 
cruel act against another however sudden when there is a blow 
of a deadly weapon with intent to do some great bodily harm 
and death ensues malice is presumed 

amongst the interstices of this network of distinctions 
there may possibly be room to extricate the killing of dr park 
man from tne category of murder but we confess the distinctions 
of the law seem framed to meet this very description of sudden 
unjustifiable passionate revengeful and reckless nomioide were 
the contrary the case few of the usual forms of murder would

einal causes 

come within the definition this confession of dr webster may 
be only another link in the chain of fatalities which he has been 
forging for his own destruction 

 final causes form an important part of the investi 
gation in cases of circimistantial evidence 

if we show that the prisoner had a strong motive for 
committing the offence such as avarice revenge c or 
had stated beforehand a determination that he would com 
mit it thifif with other circtunstances will be considered as 
tending to prove that he did commit it 

 motives are with relation to moral conduct savs mr wills 
what physical power is to mechanics and both of these kinds 
of impulse are equally under the influence of known laws but 
in reasoning upon motives and their resulting actions it is im 
practicable to obtain the same sure data as when material phce 
nomena only are involved since it is not possible to discover all 
the modifying circumstances of human conduct or to assign with 
unerring certainty the true character of the motives from which 
they spring nevertheless we naturally reasonably and safely 
judge of mens motives by their conduct as we conclude from the 
nature of the stream the quahties of the fountain whence it 
proceeds 

an evil motive constitutes in law as in morals the essence of 
guilt and the existence of an inducing motive for the voluntary 
acts of a rational agent is assumed as naturally as secondary 
causes are concluded to exist for material phflenomena the pre 
dominant desires of the mind are invariaolv followed by corre 
sponding vohtions and actions it is therefore indispensable in 
the investigation of moral actions to look at all the surrounding 
circumstances which connect the supposed actor with other 
persons and things and may have influenced his motives 

the usual inducements to crime are the desire of revenging 
real or fancied wrongs — of obtaininj some object of desire wnich 
rightfully belongs to another— or of preserving reputation either 
tlutt of general character or the conventional reputation of sex or 
profession — jfilws circumstantial evidence 

 in manv things which we do we ought not only to consider 
the mere naed action itself but the persons who act the persons 
towards whom the time when the place where the manner how 
ike end or which the action is done together with the effects that 
must or that may follow and all other surrounding circumstances 
these things must necessarily be taken into our view in order to 
determine whether the action which is indifferent in itself be 
either lawful or unlawful good or evil wise or foolish decent or 
 nt proper or improper as it is so circumstantiated

 let me give a plain instance for the illustration of this matter 
— mario kilts a dog which considered merely in itself seems to 
be an indifferent action now the dog was timons and not his 
own this makes it look unlawfol £ut timon bid him do it 
this gives it an appearance of lawfulness again it was done at 
church and in time of divine service these circumstances added 
cast on it an air of irreligion but the dog flew at mario and put 
him in danger of his life this relieves the seeming impiety of the 
action yet mario might have escaped by flying thence there 
fore the action appears to be improper but the dog was known 
to be mad this further circumstance makes it almost necessaiy 
that the dog should be slain lest he might wonjr the assembly 
and do much mischief yet adn mario killed hmi with a pistol 
which he happened to have in his pocket since yesterdays journey 
now hereby the whole congregation was terrified and discomposed 
and divine service was broken off this carries an appearance of 
great indecency and impropriety in it but after all when we con

 under tlie head of final causes we may place those 
reasonings that are founded on the presumed object of the 
measures we advocate 

thus in regard to the pimishment of criminals one 
party contends that the main object is the pimishment of 
the criminal another contends that the main object is the 
reformation of the criminal and a third contends that 
the main object of punishment is the prevention of crime 
the opinion any one may entertain as to the final cause or 
main object of punishment will of course influence his 
sentiments as to the nature duration and severity of the 
punishments that ought to be inflicted 

the proper end of punishment is said by some to be the 
satisfaction of justice by others the prevention of crimes by 
others the reformation of the offender the first doctrine is that 
which most immediately occurs to a mind beginning to reflect on 
the subject and it is often warmly defended althouffh it is now

impended to bis life of lord kames the second opinion is sup 
ported by the generality of writers although they by no means 
reject the third object as a subordinate consideration of late 
years a few philanthropists have argued that the principal object 
of punishment should be the reformation of the offender and 
that other ends are of inferior consequence 

if crimes could be more effectually prevented by any one 
pimishment than another the tendency of that punishment to 
satisfy the demand for justice or to reform the offender would be 
a secondary consideration if the crime of murder for example 
could be more effectually prevented by the penalty of death tnan 
by a term of imprisonment which would give an opportunity for 
the reformation of the criminal that penalty ought to be inflicted 
andtherefomjtion of the offender abandoned otherwise we should 
be showing more regard for the life of a murderer than for the 
lives of innocent persons — questions in political economy 

 political economists sometimes argue upon this prin 
ciple they assign motives to diflferent classes of society and 
then infer that persons under the influence of such motives 
would act in a certain manner and on the conduct thus 
assumed they construct a theory 

thus mr macculloch states that the wish to augment 
our fortunes comes with us from the womb and never leayes 
us till we go into the grave this may ba the case gene 
rally in scotland but it is not so in ireland and it is not 
 universally anywhere in all classes of society many 
individuals are found who prefer present enjoyment to a 
future improvement of their condition another erroneous 
assumption is that the iminstructed classes of society 
when left to themselves will always do that which is most 
conducive to their own advantage this argument has 
been advanced in opposition to those acts of the legislature 
that refer to regulating the hours of labour in the manu 
tories and to the working of women and children in 
mines the reasonings of some economists with reference 
to these matters will on examination be found to rest on 
erroneous assumptions

mankind in these several stages precisely the same feelings 
and motives which men entertain in the highest degree of 
civilization some political economists have written verj 
fiillaciously on this subject but in the first place there 
is no foundation for the theory that the savage life was the 
original state of man and in the next place man in a 
savage state does not possess within himself that thirst for 
knowledge and desire for improvement which is exhibited 
by man in a state of civilization 

but the opinion that all mankind were originally savages is 
unsupported by either reason or history had they been created 
savages they would probably have remained savages for ever 
they could have formed no idea of a civilization which had never 
existed nor have desired comforts the want of which they did 
not feel history does not record a single instance of a savage 
nation having become civilized by its own unassisted exertions 
civilization has never sprung up spontaneously from the soil it 
has always been imported from abroad the greeks derived their 
civilization from the egyptians the bomans theirs from the 
greeks the nations conquered by rome became civilized from 
their intercourse with the bxjmans but if we attempt to trace 
the origin of civilization in egypt and babylon we are at a loss 
for neither history nor even tradition mentions any period at 
which these nations were not civilized founded soon after the 
flood they possessed the knowledge of all the arts and sciences 
known to the antediluvian world the fertility of their soils and 
the extent of their plains furnished ample provision for their 
population hence as population increased their civilization in 
creased while on the other hand those tribes or families who 
wandered in quest of new settlements became separated from the 
rest of mankind by mountains and forests and nvers and their 
time being wholly occupied in seeking supplies of food they lost 
in the course of a few generations the knowledge they originally 
possessed and fell iito the savage state it would thus appear 
from history and from reason that the savage state was not the 
original state of man but a departure from that state arising 
from a want of communication through several ages with the 
other branches of the family of mankind — lecture on the fhilo

placing them in such a form as are best adapted to pro

terms which are used in them though they are called an address

modesty and our passions if an argument be taken from the 
nature or existence of things and addressed to the reason of man 
kind it is called armentum ad judicium when it is borrowed 
from some convincmg testimony it is argumenium ad fidem an 
address to our faith when it is drawn from any insufficient 
medium whatsoever and yet the opposer has not skill to refute or 
answer it tliis is arpumentum ad ignorantiam an address to our 
ignorance when it is built upon the professed principles or 
opinions of the person with whom we argue whether the 
opinions be true or false it is named argutnentum ad kominem an 
address to our professed principles st raul often uses this argu 
ment when he reasons with the jews and when he says i speak 
as a mmi when the argument is fetched from the sentiments of 
some wise great or good men whose authority we reverence and 
hardly dare oppose it is called araumentum ad verecundium an 
address to our modesty i add finafly when an argument is bor 
rowed from any topics which are suited to engage the inclinations 
and passions of tne hearers on the side of the speaker rather 
tlian to convince the judgment this is argumenium ad passiones 
an address to the passions or if it be made publicly it is called 
adpopulum or an appeal to the people — watts s logic

we will then illustrate the difference between reasoning 
by induction and reasoning by eduction you have ob 
served an individual come to poverty by a dishonest course 
of action and another arrive at wealth by a life of recti 
tude and you remark honesty is the best policy 
here you reason by induction from these individual 
cases you gather a proof of the general maxim honesty 
is the best policy but suppose a person shoiild ask your 
advice how to act in a case wherein strict integrity might 
appear to be less advantageous than a njore crooked pro 
cedure and you observe to him honesty is the best 
policy here you reason by deduction you apply the 
general principle to an individual case you reason on the 
principle of genus and species these two kinds of reason 
ing are just the reverse of each other when from one or 
more examples you infer a general principle that is called 
induction or reasoning from examples when from the 
general principle you infer an individual case that is called 
deduction or reasoning from genus and species induction 
is reasoning from particulars to generals and deduction is 
reasoning from generals to particulars 

but you ask how can i infer a general proposition from 
a small number of examples is it not a rule that 
generals cannot be inferred from particulars very 
true you cannot infer generals from particulars imless 
you have reason to believe that all the particulars are 
alike our reasoning here must depend upon the uni 
formity of the laws of nature when the law is uniform 
we can infer generals from particulars because we know

 llie following explanation of the nature of induction 
is taken from mr hills logic — 

an induction in which every hidividnal case is enumerated is 
a perfect demonstration ana in general the more nearly we 
approach to the entire enumeration the higher i the degree of 
probabihty attained by the iaduction provided at least that no 
facts of an opposite tendency are discoverable or that if they 
occur they are satisfactorily shown not to he recfuv inconsistent 
with the principle deduced the great error m induction is too 
great haste in drawing a conclusion without having premised a 
sufficient number of individual cases many for example if they 
have met with or heard of one or two dishonest tamers or observed 
a comet in a toarm summer think themselves auuiorized to draw

 the three introductory chapters of the epistle to the romans

duced from the train of observation mentioned in the subsequent 
verse — and that in the th verse as deduced from verses

 a correct and forcible instance of this mode of argument by 
analogy occurs in sam xvii — the examples also used 
by the israelites in their lively remonstrance with the reubenites 
c josh xxii by the jewish elders in behalf of 
jeremiah jer xxvi — and by gamaliel in behalf of the

speech of habshakeh recorded in isaiah xxxvi — presents 
a falladous instance of the same the conclusion in this case is 
not drawn de simiu there was no just comparison between the 
 omnipotent god of israel and the idolgods of the heathen 

if you turn to your bible and read the texts to which 
mr hill has referred you will perceive that his illustra

 eeasoning by example is in great use among lawyers 
one chief mode of reasoning with them is by what is 
tailed a case in point that is an example in point when 
a case is in dispute the plan is to show that a case similar 
to the present has already been decided but the example 
or case adduced will not of course be the same in all its 
circumstances as the case under trial if so there would 
have been no ground for a lawsuit as the point would 
then have been already decided but it is the object of 
the advocate to show that the case adduced establishes a 
principle and that this principle thus established will 
apply to the case under consideration 

i do not know that i can better illustrate the case in 
point than by considering the argument of the apostle 
paul his object is to prove that the apostles ought to be 
supported by the churches first then he appeals to 
the ecclesiastical law of the jews do ye not know 
that they which minister about holy things live of the 
things of the temple and they which wait at the altar 
are partakers with the altar this is an example — a 
direct case in point secondly he refers to the civil laws 
of moses there it is enacted thou shalt not muzzle the 
mouth of the ox that treadeth ouj the com it might 
be asked how is this a case in point what resemblance 
is there between the case of an immuzzled ox and that of 
the apostle the point is this the enactment respecting 
the ox establishes the principle that the labourer should 
partake of the fruit of his labour and this principle ap 
plied to the case of the apostles proves that they which 
preach the gospel should live of the gospel this case of 
the ox is then an indirect case in point the reasoning is 
first by induction and then by deduction

 sometimes an individual case is adduced for the 
purpose not of establishing but of overthrowing a general 
principle 

when your opponent tries to apply a general principle 
to an individual case you have two methods of reply you 
may either deny the general principle or deny that it is 
applicable to the case under consideration if you adopt 
the first mode you will endeavour to show that the general 
principle is untrue or unjust or inexpedient according to 
the object you have in view here again i can give you 
 scriptural example — 

then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of 
jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress tfie tradition 
of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread 
but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress 
the commandment of god by your tradition eor god com 
manded saving honour thy father and mother and he that 
curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say 
whoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by 
whatsoever thon mightest be profited by me and honour not hia 
father or his mother he shall be free thus have je made the 
commandment of god of none effect by your tradition — matt 
xv — 

here the argument of the scribes is that the disciples 
ought to have observed the tradition of the elders that 
these traditions prohibited the taking of food with un 
washed hands and that the disciples therefore had vio 
lated the tradition the reply does not deny the fact that 
the disciples had violated the tradition but it attacks the 
tradition itself — not this individual tradition but the whole 
body of traditions — by showing that in one instance at 
least they were in opposition to the moral law as some 
of these traditions were thus shown to be in direct oppo 
sition to the divine law the authority of all the traditions 
was impeached and consequently the one the disciples had 
violated was not obligatory 

as examples can often be adduced on both sides of a 
question we shall have to balance one set of examples 
against another in order to judge of the probability of the 
case under consideration you doubt whether you will

have become wealthy by taking shares in such compam 
your wife tells you of other cases in which the parties 
have been ruined here you must decide according to 
what is called the doctrine of chances or more propedj 
the doctrine of probabilities 

 we may observe these three rules in vadpng of probabilities 
which are to be determined by reason relating either to things 
past or thin to come 

that which agrees most niai the constitution of nature 
carries the greatest probability in it where no other circumstance 
appears to counterpoise it as if i let loose a greyhound within 
sight of a hare upon a large plain there is great probability the 
greyhound will seize her that a thousand sparrows will fly away 
at the sight of a hawk among them 

 that which is most coniormable to the constant observations 
of men or to experiments frequently repeated is most likely to 
be true as that a winter will not pass away in england without 
some frost and snow that if you deal out great quantities of 
strong liquor to the mob there will be manjr drunk that a laie 
assemoly of men will be of different opinions in aiiy doubtud 
point tnat a thief will make his escape out of prison if the doors 
of it are unguarded at midnight 

 in matters of fact which are past or present where neither 
nature nor observation nor custom gives us any sufcient infor 
mation on either side of the question there we may derive a pro 
bability from the attestation of wise and honest men bv word or 
writing or the concurring witnesses of multitudes who have seen 
and known what they relate c this testimony in many cases 
will arise to the degree of moral certainty so we believe that 
the plant tea grows in china and that the emperor of the turks 
hves at cjonstantinople that julius caesar conquered france 
and that jesus our saviour lived and died in judea that 
thousands were converted to the christian faith in a century 
after the death of christ and that the books which contain the 
christian religion are certain histories and epistles which were 
written above a thousand years ago — waitis improvement of 
the mind 

 among the modes of reasoning from example we 
may place the practice of divines who in commentating 
on the historical parts of scripture raise from individual 
facts some general pidnciple containing a lesson in morals 
or religion

bobinsons notes to claude 

philosophical historians adopt the same course from 
the fects they relate they make observations which from 
their great importance and general application may justly 
be denominated principles and then they establish these 
principles by adducing other facts not connected with their 
immediate history thus mr macaulay after giving a 
dismal account of the character of the clergy of t£at y 
observes it would be a great error to imagine because 
the coimtry rector was in general not regarded as a gentle 
man because he could not dare to aspire to the hand of one 
of the young ladies at the manor house because ho was not 
asked into sie parlours of the great but waa left to drink 
and smoke with grooms and butlers that the power of the 
clerical body was smaller than at present then follows 
the observation or principle he raises or founds on these 
fitcts the injluence of a class is hy no means proportioned 
to the consideration which the members of that class enjoy in 
their individtud capacity this principle requires a further 
confirmation here it is a cardinal is a much more

because they could not bring a long piece that therefore their

the word analogy means resemblance by reasoning 
from analogy we mean reasoning about one thing from its 
resemblance to another thing 

 the following are examples of this kind of reasoning

 we shall now show the application of this kind of 
reasoning to several of the sciences 

 in almost every department of human knowledge 
says mr blakey analogical reasonings are employed to a 
great extent and are foxmd to be of great utility in the 
science of comparative anatomy for example it is of sin 
gular importance to trace out the resemblances between 
the structures of different animals their organs of sensa 
tion digestion and motion and from this analogical 
inquiry we may draw usem conclusions for the govern 
ment of our own conduct and constitution and the promo 
tion of our interests for example we make experiments 
with certain kinds of food on the digestive organs of dogs 
and from these we infer or draw conclusions that such and 
such effects will result to ourselves from taking these same 
kinds of food and these experiments have often led to 
the formation of rules of diet and regimen of considerable 
importance to our bodily health many highly beneficial 
discoveries in medicine may be traced to experiments and 
observations made upon the inferior animals founded 
upon the resemblance between their functions of life and 
our own — essay on logid 

the principle of analogy has been applied to some of our 
reasonings in connexion with astronomy we have given 
you one example of this at page here is another —

the principle of analogy is also often employed in our 
moral reasonings 

public companies are analogous to other collective bodies 
idio are acknowledged to be moral agents 

 it will not be aenied that a nation may declare an unjust war 
—may carry it on in a cruel manner — may treat a conquered 
nation with oppression or may conduct a treaty of peace with 
duplicity and fraud nor will it be denied that a nation may 
bmme immoral by the extinction of moral feeling in its rulers 
and throughout the population 

 as then large bodies of men like nations are rewarded or 
punished in their collective capacity for their virtuous or vicious 
actions it would seem to follow that smaller bodies of men like 
public companies may be subjected to the same moral discipline 

 a puolic company like a nation is composed of a number of 
individuals who have a government for the regulation of their 
affairs and whose acts are considered as the acts of the whole 
body it is true that a public company is composed of a smaller 
numberof persons than a nation but that cannot affect the moral 
character of its actions it is also true that while a nation 
must always act through its government a public company may 
and often does at the general meeting of its shareholders act 
independently of its government but neither can this alter its 
moral agency for whether the form of government be aristocratical 
or democratical the duties of a nation or of a public company 
remain the same 

 in opposition to this doctrine it may be contended that to 
render pinnic bodies of men responsible in their collective capacity 
would be destructive of personal or individual responsibility but 
this is not the case a nation may be punishea for its national 
crimes and yet the individual who may have caused these crimes 
may sustain an individual punishment thus jeroboam ahab 
ana other kings of israel were individually punished while at 
the same time the nation was also nunishea in its collective 
capacity so a public company may be punished or rewarded 
for its actions wmle at the same time any individual who caused 
tikbse actions may also be personally rewarded or punished it 
may too be objected that ii a public company is to be punished 
as such for its acts then all the partners would share in the 
puniiment though many of them may have been cpite innocent 
of the crime to this we answer that the same objection would 
apply to the doctrine of national responsibility it is not pos

analogy is also used in legal argumentation — 

when a point of law has been once adjudged neither that 
question nor any which completely and in all its circumstances 
corresponds with that can be drought a second time into dispute 
but questions arise which resemble this only indirectly and in part 
in certain views and circumstances and which may seem to bear 
an equal or a greater affinity to other adjudged cases questions 
whicn can be brought within any affixed rule only by analogy and 
which hold a relation by analogy to different rules it is by the 
urging of these dijfferent analogies that the contention of the bar is 
carried on and it is in the comparison adjustment and reconci 
liation of them with one anotlier in the discerning of such dis 
tinctions and in the framing of such a determination as may 
either save the various rules alleged in the cause or if that le 
impossible may give up the weaker analogy to the stronger that 
the sagacity and wisdom of the court are seen and exercised 
amongst a thousand instances of this we may cite one of general 
notoriety in the contest that has lately been agitated concerning 
literary property the jersonal industry which an author ex 
pends upon the composition of his work bears so near a resem 
blance to that by which every other kind of prtoperty is earned 
or deserved or acquired or rather there exists such a corrcr 
spondency between what is created by the study of a mans mind 
and the production of his labour in any other way of applying it 
that he seems entitled to the same exclusive assignable and per 

etual right in both and that right to the same protection of law 
his was the analogy contended for on one sidle on the other 
hand a book as to the authors right in it appears similar to an 
invention of arty as a machine an engine a medicine and since 
the law permits these to be copied and imitated except where an 
exclusive use or sale is reserved to the inventor by patent the 
same liberty should be allowed in the publication and sale of 
books this was the analogy maintained by the advocates of an 

force to the doctrine from which the analogy is drawn thus in the text the 
moral responsibility of nations is assumed as admitted by all parties and there 
fore requiring no flirther proof from the resemblance or analogy between the 
two cases we infer the moral responsibility of public companies it is therefore 
a sufficient answer to any objection against the latter doctrine to show that it will 
equally apply to the former indeed the more numerous the objections if they 
will apply equally in both cases the more the argument is strengthened as ey 
are confirmatory of the soundness of the analogy

sion may with perfect propriety be viewed as a machine 
which has cost twenty years of assiduous attention and

a further outlay of capital may improve the machine 
 and if a further sum has been laid out in educating 
or qualifying him for the exercise of a business or profes 
sion requiring manual skill his value will be proportionably

in the moial government of the world we do not find that 
the effects of sin are removed even upon sincere repentance 
thus if a man gamble away his property sincere repent 
ance wiu not bhng it back should he ruin his constitution 
by intemperance and then repent his repentance will not 
restore his health should he by a mean or unjust action 
damage his reputation and then repent of his crime his 
repentance will not bring back his good name thus it 
is not a doctrine of natimd any more than of revealed reh

in the present life your happiness or misery will in many 
cases depend upon your own actions it is therefore pos

depend upon your actions in the present world 

if it be objected that the duration of happiness or 
misery in the iuture world is disproportionate to the dura

 analogy influences our reasonings very much by 
the extent to which it has contributed to the formation of 
language 

the faculty of association is not employed merely in the 
formation of new words but it leads also to the application of 
old words to new ideas sometimes the material ol which any 
thing was formed was employed to denote the thing itself as a 
stick a horn a stone tne name of one ohject was also pphed 
to some other to which it seemed to bear a resemblance thus 
the word branch which denotes a part of a tree is applied to a 
part of almost every object that is capable of division hence we 
speak of the branch of a road the branch of a river the branch 
 a family the branch of a discourse 

 woras which were originally employed to denote sensible 
objects were afterwards applied to intellectual ideas the last 
object to which man directs his attention and that which he finds 
the most difficult to comprehend are the powers of his own mind 
hence mankind have usuafty a large stock of words denoting 
sensible ideas before they think of naming those ideas idiich are 
intellectual and the operations of the mind can scarcely be 
understood but by comparison with external objects mankind 
therefore having found or fancied some resemblance between 
sensible and intellectual ideas applied the same words to both 
in all languages we find that words denoting intellectual ideas 
when traced to their origin are taken from sensible objects and 
were at first metaphors the words understanding evidence 
reflection as well as the words i have employed to denote the 
faculties of invention association and abstraction are all taken 
from objects of sense these words have now lost their meta 

ehorical meaning and have become quite literal through being so 
requently used so we still speak of a man being burning with 
zeal inflamed with anger swollen with rage ais inflated with 
pride and by the same figure of speech we talk of a man having 
a hard heart or a soft heart a tnick head or a long head a 
fertile imagination a sound judgment a strong memory polished 
manners and when we recommend circumspection to an indi 
vidual we tell him to look sharp 

 by the same principle of association we apply to inanimate 
objects words denoting ideas peculiar to animals feus we speak 
of the head of a river the face of a country a neck of land and 
an arm of the sea of a runnmg stream and a standing pool

the following comparison is drawn by the kev sydney

 a book has no eves and ears and feelings the best are apt

book walks about and varies his conversation and manner and 
prevents you from going to sleep there is certainly a great evil 
m this as well as a good for the interest between a man and his 
hvin folio becomes sometimes a httle too keen and in the com 
petition for victory they become a httle too animated towards 
and sometimes exasperated against each other whereas a man 
and his book generallj keep the peace with tolerable success and 
if jihey disagree the man shuts his book and tosses it into a 
comer of the room which it might not be cuite so safe or easy 
to do with a living folio it is an inconvemence in a book that 
fou cannot ask questions there is no explanation and a man is 
ess guarded in conversation than in a book and tells you with 
more honesty the httle niceties and exceptions of his opinions 
whereas in a book as his opinions are canvassed where they 
cannot be explained and defended he often overstates a point for 
fear of being misunderstood but then on the contrary almost 
every man talks a great deal better in his books with more sense 
more information and more reflection than he can possibly do in 
his conversation because he has more time — moral philosophy

 having now taken a view of analogy comparison 
and contrast we will conclude thjs section by taking a view 
of fallacious analogies 

analogies are of two kinds they may denote a resem 
blance between two things themselves or merely a resem 
blance between the circumstances in which they are placed 
thus when sydney smith argues that dispositions are 
hereditary from the analogy between men and animals 
the resemblance is between the things themielves but 
when he tells us we ought not to decry the science of

moral philosophy inasmuch as several other sciences ar 
liable to the same objections the analogy is between the 
circumstances in which these sciences are placed we 
are thus liable to make two mistakes when we find there 
is an analogy between the things themselves we may erro 
neously infer there is an analogy in their circumstances 
or when we find an analogy in their circumstances we 
may infer there is an analogy in the things themselves 

the first error is exhibited very often in the analces 
drawn between men and animals there is no doubt a 
resemblance between reason and instinct hence some 
have inferred that there is an analogy between men and 
animals in their rights with reference to each other paley 
and others have contended on this ground that men have 
no right to kill animals for food we think they are in 
correct in their analogies 

 the reasons alleged in vindication of this practice are the 
following that the several species of brutes being created to 
prey upon one another affords a kind of analogy to prove that 
the human species were intended to feed upon them that if let 
alone they would overrun the earth and exclude mankind from 
the occupation of it that they are requited for what they suffer 
at our hands by our care and protection 

 upon which reasons i would observe that the analogy con 
tended for is extremely lame since brutes have no power to 
support life by any other means and since we have for the 
whole human species might subsist entirely upon fruit pulse 
lierbs and roots as many tribes of hindoos actually do the 
two other reasons may be valid reasons as far as they go for 
no doubt if man had been supported entirely by vegetable food 
a great part of those animals which die to furnish his table would 
never have lived but they by no means justify our right over 
the lives of brutes to the extent in which we exercise it what 
danger is there for instance of fish interfering wnh us in the use 
of their element or what do we contribute to their support or 
preservation — faleys moral fhilosojpht 

in his speech at the peace congress held in frankfort 
mr cobden contended for the principle of arbitration 
between nations upon the ground of the analogy between 
nations and individtials it is done in private life con 
tinually scores and hundreds of british acts of parliar 
ment have been passed requiring that such disputes should

be settled by arbitration and the principle you find good 
for individuals you will find good for nations here there 
is a want of analogy in the circumstances of the parties 
if two individuals in a state refer their dispute to arbi 
tration the law will compel them to abide by the de 
cision of the arbitrator but in the case of nations if either 
party chooses to dispute the decision of the arbitrator 
who is to enforce obedience and by what means except 
by war 

the second error is when from an analogy in rcum 
stances we infer an analogy in the things themselves 

archbishop whately defends logic by the analogical 
mode of reasoning and when he confines his analogies 
merely to the circumstances in which logic resembles other 
sciences his reajsoning is generally conclusive but some 
times he goes beyond this and finds or fancies analogies 
between the nature of logic and that of other sciences to 
which it bears no resemblance for example he finds 
n analogy between logic and chemistry i quote mr 
blakey — 

 in an able work recently published by archbishap whately 
on the use of the syllogistic theory the author observes that 
 logic which is as it were the grammar of reasoning does not 
bring forward the regular syllogism as a distinct moae of argu 
mentation designed to be substituted for any other mode but 
as the form to which all correct reasoning may be ultimately 
reduced and which consequently serves the purpose when we 
are employing logic as an art of a test to try the validity of any 
aiument in the same manner as by chemical analysis we de 
velop and submit to a distinct examination the elements of which 
any compound body is composed and are thus enabled to detect 
any latent sophistication and impurity 

 it appears to me that the archoishop has fallen into error 
regarding the nature and importance oi the syllogism from in 
stituting certain analogies between it and some other departments 
of knowlecfee such as chemistry grammar and arithmetic he 
compares the analysis of a piece of reasoning to the chemical 
analysis of any material substance he imagines that the logic 
ol syllogisms bears the same relation to general reasoning tnat 
grammar does to language and the techmcal terms in which the 
syllogistic process is couched are viewed as resembling the arbi 
trary signs afixed to arithmetical quantities a very slight atten 
tion however to these analogical illustrations will be sufficient

essa on logic 

archbishop whately tisually argues by analogy in 
reading through his book on logic i have marked with a 
pencil thirtyfour instances of his arguing by analogy but 
the most striking example he has given of this principle of 
reasoning is in his pamphlet entitled historic doubts 
relative to napoleon buonaparte the object of this 
pamphlet was to show that by the same reasoning through 
which infidel writers have attempted to cast doubts on the 
new testament history they might cast doubts on the 
history of napoleon buonaparte and as we know the 
history of napoleon buonaparte to be true although it is 
exposed to these objections so the history of the new 
testament may be true although it has been attacked by 
similar objections we shall have occasion hereafter to 
make a few extracts from this singular pamphlet 

another kind of feiilacious reasoning is when the analogy 
is merely verbal or metaphorical and there is no real 
resemblance between the things or their circumstances 

 among the metaphors which conceal an altogether fatal 
theory there is none more commonly used than that put forward 
in the words tribute tributary 

 these words have become so common that they are used as 
synonymes of purchase purchaser and the words are used indif 
ferently for the one or the other 

 but nevertheless there is as great a difference between tri 
bute and purchase as between thejf and exchange and i would 
iiist as soon hear it said that cartouche has brcien open a strong 
dox and has purchased a thousand crowns as i would hear our 
honourable deputies repeat we have paid to grermany a tribute 
for a thousand horses which she has sold to us 

 for that which renders cartouches action no purchase is 
that he has not put and with my consent into my strong box 
a value equivalent to that which he has taken out 

 and that which causes the payment of francs which 
we have made to germany to oe no tribute is because she has 
not received it tuitously but by giving us in exchange a thou 
sand horses which we ourselves have judged to be worth our 
 francs

cies respecting general interests translated by g porter 

in using the principle of analogy you must be careful 
that your analogical case is one that is sound or at least 
is admitted to he sound by the party you are anxious to 
convince your opponent may and probably will deny 
the analogy between the two cases this is a fair reply 
and brings the argument to a practical discussion but if 
your opponent takes a different view from yours of the 
parallel case that you adduce you have been unfortunate 
in the choice of your analogy for instance suppose you 
are disputing with a person who contends that a man ought 
to be allowed to marry the sister of his deceased wife and 
you say upon this ground you ought to admit that a 
woman should be allowed to marry the brother of her 
deceased husband he might reply so i do i contend 
for both here your andogy has missed fire and the 
ground of controversy must be changed but if your op 
ponent denies the latter case but contends for the former 
then your argumentation will naturally take the form of 
analogy 

i fijiall conclude this section by noticing a very inge 
nious argument drawn from the doctrine of analogy in 
reasoning from analogy we usiially compare good things 
with good things and evil things with evil thii hence 
mr aiken considers that the analogies drawn in the new 
testament between a christian and a soldier are a proof 
of the innocency of war he has put this argument very 
forcibly in the following words — 

 it appears on the grounds already stated that reason and the 
natural law of selfpreservation and our duty to ourselves rela 
tions friends and countrymen also that the divine command 
and permission to the jews all prove that war majr be necessary 
and just and such a war is not expressly prombited by the 
christian religion on the contr there are frequent allusions 
to war in the new testament in which no censure is implied or 
expressed the trumpet the weapons the armour of war are 
often employed as images to illustrate the christian warfare 
here the analogy is that the christian is a spiritual warrior

reasoning from parables fables and proverbs 

we take the following explanation of the word parable from 
dr blacks students manual parable from para 
side by side and halloy i put thus parable means a simili 
tude or one thing compared to anoiier it is usually em 
ployed to designate a fable or allegorical instruction founded 
on something real or apparent in nature or history from 
which a moiul is drawil by comparing it with something in 
which the people are more inmiediately concerned 

the word parable is applied in the new testament to 
four different kinds of literary compositions these are 
tales comparisons parables strictly so called i e allegories 
and fables we will give an example of each 

the following is a tale — 

 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a 
certain rich man brought forth plentifully and ne thought 
within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room 
where to bestow my suits and he said this will i do i will 
pull down my bams and build greater and there will i bestow 
all my fruits and my goods and i will say to my soul soul 
thou hast much goods laid up for man vears take thine ease 
eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool 
this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall 
those things be which thou hast provided so is he that layeth 
up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god — luke xii 
— 

a tal differs from a parable strictly so called in having 
no reference beyond iuelf the above tale illustrates the 
futility and uncertainty of riches but it has no allegorical 

digitized bycjooglc 



rkajboning from parables 

meaning it is not employed as a similitude or com 
parison to illustrate anything else the same observation 
 may be applied to the parables as they are called of the 
rich man and lazarus luke xvi — the pharisee 
and publican luke xviii — the improfitable servant 
luke xix — and the unfeeling servant matt 
xviii — which viewed as literary compositions are 
strictly speaking not parables but tales 

the liiode of reasoning from tales is the same as reason 
ing from examples tales are records of events that have 
occurred or are so probable that they might have occurred 
the lessons drawn from these tales are the general prin 
ciples which the facts tend to prove it is a mode of 
reasoning by induction we have discussed this subject 
in the first section of this part of our work 

the following is a comparison — 

 another parable put he forth unto them saying the king 
dom of heaven is like to a grain of mustardseed which a man 
took and sowed in his field which indeed is the least of all 
seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and 
becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in 
the branches thereof — matt xiii 

a comparison difiers from a tale in that it is employed 
to illustrate something beyond itself it differs from a para 
ble in that the illustration is confined generally to one point 
in the above example the comparison between the illus 
tration and the thing illustrated is confined to one quality 
that of rapid and extensive increase there is no general 
resemblance in other respects between the two things com 
pared an attempt to discover such resemblances would 
be ridiculous to the same class of compositions belong 
the two foundations matt vii — the leaven hid 
in the meal matt xiii the treasure hid in a field 
matt xiii the merchant seeking goodly pearls matt 
xiii the net cast into the sea fmatt xiii 
the figtree luke xxi and several others 

of comparison as a principle of reasoning we have 
already treated here comparison is brought before us in 
the way of metaphor in this point of view it can never 
amount to proof but nevertheless its consideration is 
fiurly within the province of logic one part of our duty

as logicians is to state clearly the propositions we inteiul 
to prove metaphorical comparisons are of great use 
in enabling ns to make this clear statement half the 
disputes that exist among men arise from their misunder 
standing one another we should endeavour to acqidre 
the art of stating clearly and vividly what it is that we 
mean and when we have done this we shall in most cases 
have obviated the necessity for any further controversy 

the following is a parable in the strict sense of the 
word — 

hearken behold there went out a sower to sow and it 
came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the 
foirls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on 
stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it 
sprang up because it had no depth of earth but when the sun 
was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered 
away and some fell amon thorns and the thorns grew up and 
choked it and it yielded no fruit and other fell on good ground 
and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought 
forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred— 
mark iv — 

the parable strictly so called is an allegory it is em 
ployed to illustrate something that seems at first to have 
no connexion with it and the machinery of the composition 
must correspond vnth the several parts of the matter to be 
ulustrajted the following explanation of the above parable 
will exemplify this in a very striking manner — 

the sower soweth the woid and these are they by the 
wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard 
satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was 
sown in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown 
on stony ground who when they have heard the word imme 
diately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves 
and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or perse 
cution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended 
and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear 
the word and the eares of this world and the deceitfulness of 
riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word 
and it becometh unfmitful and these are they which are sown 
on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and 
bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an 
hundred— jiftfrifc iv —

mark xii — and several others there are also 

many examples of this kind of composition in the old

ezekiel xvii — in minuteness of illustration the 

parables have an advantage over comparisons but the 

apphcation of minute portions of the parable should not 

be strained i have heard of a divine who in explaining 

the parable of the good samaritan stated that the twa 

pence denoted the old and the new testament 

parables like comparisons are not proofs they are 
however vivid illustrations and the more minute the 
particulars the stronger is the illustration there is of 
course always an analogy between the illustration and the 
matter to be illustrated but we must distinguish between 
a logical and a metaphorical analogy for instance the 
analogy between an animal who had fallen into a pit and a 
man who was lame was a logical analogy and it was clear 
that if one might be relieved on the sabbathday so might 
the other but the analogy between the kingdom of heaven 
and a grain of mustard seed was a metaphorical analogy 
and the rapid increase of the mustard seed was no proof 
of the future rapid spread of christianity though it was a 
vivid representation of it 

i may state to you that sometimes the same composition 
may be either a tale a comparison a ble or a parable 
according to the manner in which it is viewed thus the 
good samaritan if viewed as an answer to the question 
who is my neighbour and as inculcating the exercise of 
kindness and benevolence is a tale but if the condition 
of the man who fell among thieves is considered as repre 
senting the moral state of mankind and the good samaritan 
as representing the saviour of the world and divines often 
take this view then it is a parable so a comparison be

we now proceed to fables 

we need hardly obsotve that we do not use the word 
ble in any disreputable sense as denoting fisdsehood but 
merely as ike name of a certain kind of literary com 
position 

the following is a fable — 

and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men 
ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a 
city a judge which feared not god neither regarded m and 
there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying 
avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while 
but afterward he said within himself thoueh i fear not god nor 
regard man yet because this widow troulneth me i will aven 
her lest by her continual coming she weary me— zy xviil 
 

the fable is a composition designed to illustrate a jyro 
position which is called the moral of the foble it is not 
necessary that the machinery of the fable shotdd bear any 
resemblance to any moral process to which the proposition

may be applied herein it differs from the parable the 
machinery pf the parable or allegory must correspond 
with the moral processes it is intended to illustrate the 
madiineiy of the fiible represents nothing it is required 
only that the result shall illustrate a proposition and this 
proposition must seem to flow from iiie plot of the fable 
in the feble we have quoted the proposition to be proved 
or illustrated is the advantage of perseverance in prayer 
but there is no correspondence between the machinery of 
the ble and the parties to whom reference is made in 
ct the mae derives no small portion of its force from 
this want of resemblance it amounts to an d fortiori 
argument the reasoning is thus if an unjust judge is 
induced by importunity to grant a request how much 
rather shall the judge in heaven grant the requests of his 
servants this is the application in the subsequent verses 
 and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day 
and night imto him though he bear long with them i 
tell you that he will avenge them speedily the same 
lesson is taught by the ble of the midnight visitor luke 

fables occupied in ancient times a more honourable 
station in the estimation of mankind than they do at 
present they ae now employed chiefly as the means of 
imparting instruction to children or as the profitable 
amusement of a leisure hour in former days the con 
struction of fables was the serious employment of states 
men and philosophers it always ensured to such as were 
successful a degree of literary eminence and sometimes 
even conferred upon them political distinctions but 
though we are not now accustomed to consider ibles aa 
the most eminent literary productions they are by no 
means the least useful it is from fables that the greater 
part of mankind derive their first lessons in moral science 
at a time when their minds are incapable of abstract 
reflection and when no other mode of instruction would 
be either so entertaining or so eflcacious the knowledge 
thus acquired becomes interwoven with the earliest recol 
lections of the mind and often regulates the conduct in

tion we wish to exhibit appears to flow from the plot of the 
fable and thus makes deeper impression on the mind than 
if it had been expressed in literal terms this truth is 
commonly a moral one and hence it is called the mcal of 
the ble but it is not necessarily connected with ethics 
for it may be connected with poutics or with the ordinary 
aflsdrs of life the subject of a fable should not be a 
truth so obvious that it could not have escaped the most 
ordinary observation it would be ridiculous to invent a 
ble to show that every man is subject to deatl but the 
observation that although in our distress we may some 
times call out for death yetthat when he arrives we receive 
him with reluctance may properly become the subject of a 
fietble and it has been well illustrated in the story of the 
old man and his bundle of sticks 

a ble is different from an example upon the relative 
merits of fables and examples aristotle makes the follow 
ing remarks the occasion wherein fables are more in 
point and employed with the greatest success is in popular 
addresses and in debates upon great questions they have 
this advantage over example that it is difficult to find in 
history circumstances perfectly relevant to what we would 
wish to prove whereas a fable is easily invented and in 
order to this nothing more is necessary than to draw a 
parable which any man may do who knows in what resem 
blance consists a thing by no means difficult to the least 
proficient in philosophy 

 example however surpasses feble in this respect timt 
its proofs which are founded upon the truth of history 
and the decided allegation of events are of much greater 
effect in deliberation and more appropriate to persuasive 
oratory this happens on accoimt of the great resemblance 
between all occurrences inasmuch as it may be said that 
the past is commonly a presage of the future and ihsit 
nothing almost is done nowadays which was not for 
merly done 

the german fabulist lessing controverts this opinion 
but here we think that aristotle is right let ns suppose 
that in the senate of our land a measure is introduced 
which involves the question whether standing armies are 
unfriendly to liberty let a speaker who wished to prove

by the author of the horse who allowed the man to

from historical examples — let him adduce the numerous 
instances in which despotic and tyrannical governments 
have been supported by means of standing armies — let 
him refer to the times of julius csesar of cromwell and 
of napoleon — let him do this and then we will ask 
which speaker is the more likely to carry conviction to 
the mind in feet the evidence derived from febles and 
particularly from fables in which animals are introduced 
never can amount to proof how easily for instance 
might the feble we have mentioned excellent as it is be 
overturned for if the horse were a rational animal as 
thefeble supposes him to be could he not easily throw 
the man from his back and hence might not an oppo 
nolt contend that the citizens being rational beings might 
th equal ease throw off a military government as soon as 
they found it oppressive facts however are stabbom

parables we have already observed do not prove they 
only illustsute indeed they are rarely used for the 
purposes of controversy they serve to explain what was 
previously obscure and thus enable the mind to perceive 
the truths more clearly and hence to believe them more 
firmly fables are of a more controversial character 
many of them were originally invented for political pur 
poses their object is to illustrate a general proposinon 
which general proposition is applied to the particular case 
that we wish to demonstrate in the composition of the 
feble we invent a series of supposed facts which by a 
species of induction are designed to prove as fiar as they

go a general propositiod which is called the moral of the 
feble we then take this general proposition and apply 
it to any case or to all the cases to which it will apply 
this is deduction it is a kind of argument that we have 
classed under the relation of genus and species and would 
rank under the first figure of syllogisms in scholastic logic 
the design of fables then is to teach us general maxims 
and propositions which we are to apply as we may have 
occasion to practical pmposes in our progress through 
the world hence the propriety of teaching them to 
children by this means they acquire at an early age 
lessons of profound wisdom in an interesting and agreeable 
manner which is likely to make a deep impression on the 
memory 

we shall further explain the mode of reasoning through 
the application of fables by an example from the feibles 
of sop in most of these febles we find that actions 
are attributed to animals the reason is that certain 
animals are supposed to represent certain characters or 
dispositions thus the lion is the rresentative of 
courage and magnanimity the fox of cunning the pea 
cock of beauty this however is not a necessary feature 
in the composition of a fiible we have many excellent 
bles both ancient and modem in which no animals are 
introduced 

the following is a wellknown fiible taken from ifisop 
with the application of dr croxall — 

the wind and the sun — a dispute once arose betwixt the 
northwind and sun about the superiority of their power and 
they agreed to try their strength upon a traveller which should be 
able to get his cloak off first the northwind begaa and blew a 
very cold blast accompanied with a sharp driving shower but 
this and whatever else he could do instead of making the man 
quit his cloak obliged him to ghrd it about his body as close as 
possible next came the son who breaking out from a thick watery 
cloud drove away the cold vapours from the sky and darted his 
warfi sultry beams upon the head of the poor weatherbeaten 
traveller the man growing faint with the heat and unable to 
endure it any longer first throws off his heavy cloak and then 
files for protection to the shade of a neighbouring grove

disraeli has an article on the philosophy of proverbs 
he obseryes that some difficulty has occurred in the defi 
nition i shall assume that you know what is meant by 
a proverb and when a thing is well known definition 
may do more harm than good formal logical definitions 
of things well known sometimes lead to verbal quibbling 
and after all can seldom be so worded as to include every 
individual of the qecies a lady asked a gentleman the

a proverb should have sense shortness and salt 

 from the antiquity of proverbs they may be defined 
the primitive language of mankind in which knowledge 
was preserved prior to the invention of letters in the 
early stages of society its progress is retarded by three 
causes the scarcity of words to express ideas the feeble 
ness of memory from the absence of intellectual exertion 
and the want of a durable character by which the dis 
coveries of one generation may be retained and transmitted 
to another proverbs are well adapted for removing these 
first obstacles to improvement by a figurative expression 
they supply the place of verbal description their brevity 
is an aid to memory while by being connected with local 
circumstances and surroimding objects they form a visible 
type in which passing occurrences and observations may 
be recorded accordingly we find that all nations have 
had recourse to aphoristic language and doubtless it was 
in this style the first knowledge of the world its laws 
morals husbandry and observations on the weather were 
preserved

on the imdesigned coincidences between certain passages in 
st pauls epistles and some particulars of the aposties 
life and labours as related by st luke in the acts and 
every intelligent reader of his treatise will admit that he 
has pointed out and illustrated such a series of minute and 
undesigned agreements between those two narrations as 
can in no way be accounted for but by a supposition of 
their truth similar latent proofs of harmony and verity 
may i think be detected by comparing the allusions in 
the book of proverbs with the old testament history 
just as dr paley by placing the pauline epistles and st 
lukes narrative as it were in the witnessbox and sub 
jecting them to a searching crossexamination has elicited 
from both that kind of testimony which has most weight 
with judge and jury — coincident testimony so minute and 
circumstantial as to exclude the suspicion of collusion so

mr nicholls ma of queens college cambridge has 
published a work entitled the book of proverbs ex 
plained and illustrated from holy scripture he makes 
the following observations on the proverbs of solomon — 

 a proverb strictly speaking is a short moral sentence 
which means something further than what the words lite 
rally imply it is as apples of gold in a network of suver 
grave and profound sentiment the truth of which acquires 
additional beauty when partially discovered through the 
veil of elegant fiction and imagery but most of solo 
mons proverbs are rather to be called maiims or sentences 
the distinction between a proverb strictiy so called and a 
maxim or sentence may be thus illustrated when solo 
mon says trust in the lord with all thine hearty and 
lean not to thine own understanding this is no proverb 
but a moral sentence when he says drink waters out 
of thine own cistern this is a proverb and it means 
meddle not with that which belongs to another 

 out of the vast treasures of learning left us in this 
small volume the best advice is furnished to princes 
counsellors judges and other public ministers to all sorts 
of subjects in their several relations and in every condition 
to make them both pious and politic to direct them in the 
choice of their comforts in the education of their children 
in the management of domestic airs and in their traiueh 
actions with other men in contracting or conducting their 
friendships in giving or taking good counsel and reproof 
in making or presndng peace in judging of men and of 
the event of their designs this book bridles the injurious 
tongue corrects the wanton eye and ties the unjust hands 
in chains it persecutes sloth chastises all absurd desires 
teaches prudence raises mens courage and represents tem 
perance and chastity after such a fiishion that one cannot 
but have them in veneration — end thus is as basil says 
an universal direction for all men and for the whole of life 
it moreover not only gives sueh universal directions but

enforces attention to them from those motives which can 
alone secure obedience to them such as the authority of 
god his exact notice of all mens ways and hearts the 
rewards which attend righteousness and the pimishments 
which follow wickedness by his just appointment both in 
this world and the next 

the mode of illustration adopted by mr nicholh is to 
state the proverb and then to cite those instances in 
which the principle has been exemplified in scripture 
history these fects like an argument from induction 
tend to prove the truth of the proverb we give the fol 
lowing as an example —

an interest in those of his fellowprisoners the chief butler and

proverbs are often the morals of fables they are not 
usually capable of being proved by reasoning they are 
proved by observation and experience and are many of 
them the results of the experience f ages but referring 
chiefly to morals and manners they possess only a moral 
universality and hence it is often easy to point out some 
cases in which they are not realized thus — the diligent

wbitten documents give rise to a vast deal of aiga 
mentatioil different meanings are attached to letters to 
agreements to wills and to man j other writings to decide 
the questions which are thns raised we must have reconibe 
to reasoning sometimes the anihenticity of the docoment 
is denied we have then to prove that it was written by 
the author whose name it bears and in the case of willfi 
we have also to prove that the party was of sound mind 
when he affixed his signature at ouier times the dispute 
has reference to the meaning of the document here we 
have to show what was the meaning intended by the authcv 
when there is no doubt about either the authenticity or 
the meaning the questions raised will have a reference to 
the diaracter of those cases to which the terms of the 
document may be applied for example the written law 
prohibits murder i then one man kills another in a 
duel is that murder or only manslaughter the law 
prohibits swindling if then a man borrows money know 
ing that he cannot repay it is that swindling or is it an 
ordinary debt 

the trials that take place in our civil and criminal 
courts with a view to cucertain thefctcts of the case are not 
reasonings from written documents the object is merely 
to prove the factb the evidence received is either direct 
or indirect direct evidence is the testimony of witnesses 
and here reasoning is employed only in regard to the cha 
racter and credibility of the witnesses the other kind of 
evidence is indirect or as it is called circumstantial we 
have explained this kind of evidence in the section on 
conditional causes at page when points of law are 
reserved for the opinions of the judges or cases are argued 
in banco the reasonings have a reference to written 
documents — that is to the meaning and application of

reasoning from written documents 

ftnd commons but the laws sometimes require to be 
explained the duty of explaining the laws devolves on 
the judges but the judges explain only those portions 
reecting which there is any doubt and these portions 
are pointed out to them by the disputes that arise between 
the citizens these disputes refer to various points some 
times two laws appear to contradict one another in thid 
case the judges wul fix upon the meaning that is supposed 
to be most in accordance with the intentions of the legis 
lature for the judges always pay the legislature the com 
pliment to suppose that it did not intend to enact contra 
dictory laws in these cases the principle of reasoning is 
as we have already seen from final cause and effect 
sometimes the question is whether a certain action or a 
certain class of actions is included within certain phrase 
ology here the reasoning is between genus and species 
often le question is whether laws passed in former times 
do apply to modem inventions or practices here the rea 
soning is often by analogy 

this mode of reasoning from written documents so far 
as it refers to the laws of our coimtry will perhaps be 
best explained by a practical illustration and for this 
purpose we shall notice the legal decisions that have taken 
plaob with reference to jointstock banking 

at the renewal of the bank of england charter in the 
year a clause was introduced which prohibited any 
other company consisting of more than six persons to 
borrow owe or take up any sum or sums of money on 
their bius or notes payable on demand or at a less time 
than six months from the borrowing thereof 

this clause intended to prohibit the issue of notes 
was supposed to prevent the formation of any banks con 
sisting of more than six persons even should they not 
issue notes 

but in the year when the bank charter was 
about to be again renewed a doubt arose as to whether 
this was the meaning of the law the chancellor of the 
exchequer lord althorp required the opinion of the 
attorney and the solicitorgeneral who stated that the law 
did not prohibit the formation of banks having more than 
mx partners provided they did not issue notes two other

eoudbel of equal eminenoe gaye their opinion the other 
way to remove all doubts a clause was ultimately intro 
duced which declared and enacted that such companies 
might be formed here was an instance of the uncertainty 
of the law being removed not by an appeal to the judges 
but by a declaratory enactment 

the law having thus sanctioned the establishment of 
jointstock banks in london a jointstock bank was 
formed and like other banks in london accepted bills of 
exchange drawn by its country connexions but the bank 
of england alleged that this was a violation of the above 
prohibition against borrowing owing or taking up 
money o here the reasoning was on the rdation 
of genus and species the words prohibited a certain 
class of actions and the question was whether accepting 
bills as well as issuing notes was included in the pro 
hibited class the law decided that it was and an 
injunction was obtained in prohibiting the accept 
ance of all bills drawn at less than six months after date 
in the year an act of parliament granted to such 
banks the same priviles as are exercised by private 
bankers 

the lawyers have always maintained that a strict 
analogy exists between private partnerdiips and puuic 
companies the only derence they contend is in the 
number of the partners and hence the laws passed 
originally with reference to small partnerships they think 
ought to be applied to large partnerships from this 
cause has arisen much litigation and many appeals to the 
government to amend the laws in the following casee 
the appeals have been successful 

the law requires that the names of all the partners in a 
firm that is either plaintiff or defendant in a suit should be 
placed on the record when jointstock banks were first 
allowed in england in beyond sixtyfive miles from 
london they were allowed to sue or be sued in the name of 
one or two partners who were registered for that purpose at 
the stamp oflce but this privilege was not granted to the 
banks formed in london hence previous to those 
banks were compelled to make a special agreement with 
every customer whereby he held himself answerable per

nesses was a shareholder in the company the question 
was raised whether he could be legally examined as a 
witness the court of exchequer decided that he could 
not thus a shareholder in a public company was consi

ii — the ecclesiastical law 

in ecclesiastical as well as in civil law we have to 
eason from written documents 

 the eccleaiastical laws have been for the most part derived 
from the authority exercised by the roman pontin in the dif 
ferent states and kinjoms of europe the decrees and canons 
of the church are said to have been adopted in england as eariy 
as the seventh century but the system of laws at present in 
force depends upon the decretals ana constitutions compiled and 
promulgated under the influence of successive popes at various 
periods in england the authority of the canon law has been at 
all times much restricted being considered in many points 
repugnant to the law of the land or incompatible with the juris 
diction of the courts of common law so much of it as has been 
received has been gradually accommodated by our lawyers to the 
habits ajid customs of the country and the ecclesiastical laws 
may now be described in the lanruage of our statutes laws 
which the people have taken at tneir free hberty by their own 
consent to be used among them and not as the laws of any 
foreign prince potentate or prelate — mcullochs staiistical 
accouni of the british empire 

with reference to the questions that may arise in the 
ecclesiastical courts that call for the exercise of reasoning 
in regard to written documents we cannot adduce a better 
illustration than by referring to the case that has recently 
excited so much interest between the bishop of exeter and 
the eev mr gorham our quotations are taken from the 
decision of the judicial committee of the privy council as 
reported in the times of the th march we take 
however such portions only as will serve to exemplify the 
method of interpretation witii regard to ecdesiasticid law —

lord langdale read the printed judgment of the committee 
which was as follows — 

this is an appeal by the rev george cornelius gorham 
against the sentence of the dean of the arches court of canter 
bury in a proceeding termed a duplex querela in which the 
bight rev the lord bishop of exeter at the instance of mr 
gorham was called upon to show cause why he had refused to 
institute mr gorham to the vicarage of brampford speke 

the jud pronounced that the bishop had shown sufficient 
cause for his refusal and thereupon dismissed him om all 
farther observance of justice in the premises and moreover 
condemned mr gorham in costs 

prom this sentence mr gorhain appealed to her majesty in 
council the case was referred by her majesty to this com 
mittee it has been fully heard before us and by the direction 
of her majesty the hearing was attended by my lords the 
archbishops of canterbury and york and the bishop of london 
who are members of her majestys privy council we have 
satisfaction in beinff authorized to state that the most rev 
prelates the archbishops of canterbury and of york after having 
perused copies of this judgment have expressed their approba 
tion thereof the bishop of london does not concur 

the facts so far as it is necessary to state them are as 
follow — 

mr gorham being vicar of st justinpenwith in the 
diocese of exeter on the d of november was presented 
by her majesty to the vicarage of brampford speke in the 
same diocese and soon after applied to the lord bishop of 
exeter for admission and institution to the vicarage 

the bishop on the th of november causeid mr gorham 
to be informed that his lordship felt it his duty to ascertain by 
examination whether mr gbrham was sound in doctrine before 
he should be instituted to the vicarage of brampford speke 

the examination commenced on the th of december and 
was continued at very great length for five days in the same 
month of december and after some suspension for three more 
days in the following month of march 

the questions proposed by the bishop related principally to 
the sacrament of baptism and were very numerous much varied 
in form embracing many points of difficultv and often referring 
to the answers given to previous questions 

mr gorham being refused institution commenced pro 
ceedings in the arches court of canterbury and at his promo 
lion a monition with intimation issued on the th june 
and thereby the bishop was monished to admit mr gorham to 
the vicarage and to institute and invest him therein or otherwise 
to appear to show cause why mr gorham should not be admitted

and instituted by the official principal of the arches court of 
canterbury 

 adoptmg this course the doctrine held by mr gorham 
appears to us to be this — that baotism is a sacrament generally 
necessary to salvation but that tne grace of regeneration does 
not so necessarily accompany the act of baptism that regene 
ration invariably takes place in baptism that the grace may be 
granted before m or after baptism that baptism is an effectual 
sign of grace by which grod works invisibly in us but only in 
such as worthily receive it — in them alone it has a wholesome 
effect and that without reference to the qualification of the 
recipient it is not in itself an effectual sign of grace that 
infants baptized and dying before actual sin are certainly saved 
but that in no case is regeneration in baptism unconditional 

 these beinff as we collect them the opinions of mr gorham 
the question wnich we have to decide is not whether they are 
theologically sound or unsound — not whether upon some of the 
doctrines comprised in the opinions other opinions opposite to them 
may or may not be held with equal or even greater reason by other 
learned and pious ministers of the church but whether the 
opinions now under our consideration are contrary or repugnant 
to the doctrines which the church of england by its articles 
fcmnularies and rubrics requires to be hdd by its ministers so 
that upon the ground of those opinions the appellant can lawfully 
be excluded from the benefice to which he has been presented 

 this question must be decided by the articles and liturgy 
and we must apply to the construction of those books the same rules 
which have long been established and are by the law applicable to 
the construction of all written instruments we must endeavour 
to attain for ourselves the true meaning of the language employed 
assisted only by the consideration of such external or historical 
facts as we may find necessary to enable us to understand the 
subiect matter to which the instruments relate and the meaning 
of the words employed 

 in our endeavours to ascertain the true meaning and effect of 
the articles formularies and rubrics we must by no means inten 
tionally swerve from the old established rules of construction or 
depart from the principles which have received the sanction and 
approbation of the most learned persons in times past as being 
on the whole the best calculated to determine the true meaning of 
the documents to be examinedi if these principles are not adhered 
to all the rights both spiritual and tanporal of h majesty s 
subjects would be endangered 

 if it were supposed that all points of doctrine were decided 
by the church of england the law could not consider any point 
as left doubtful the application of the law or of the doctrine 
of the church of england to any theological question which

arose must be the subject of decision and the decision would be 
governed by the construction of the terfiis in which the doctrine of 
the church is expressed viz the construction which on the whole 
would seem most likely to be right 

but if the case be as undoubtedly it is that in the church 
of england many points of theologieed doctrine have not been 
decided then the nrst and great question which arises in such 
oases athe present is whether the dimued point is or was meant 
to be settled at all or whether it is left open for each member of 
the church to decide for himself according to his own conscien 
tious opinion if there be any doctrine on which the articles 
are silent or ambiguously expressed so as to be capable of two 
meanings we must suppoie that it was intended to leave that doc 
trine to private judgment unless the rubrics and formularies clearly 
and distinctly decide it if ihtj do we must conclude that the 
doctrine so decided is the doctrine of the church but on the 
other hand if the expressions used in the rubrics and formularies 
are ambious it is not to be concluded that the church meant 
to establish indirectly as a doctrine that which it did not establish 
directly as sudi by the articles of faith — the code ayowedly made 
for the avoiding of diversities of opinion and for the establishing 
of consent touching true religion 

 we must proceed therefore with the freedom which the ad 
ministration of the law requires to examine the articles and the 
prayerbook for the purpose of discovering what it is if any 
thii which by the kw of england or the doctrine of the church 
of england as by law established is declared as to the matter now 
in question and to ascertain whether the doctrine held by mr 
gornam as we understand it to be disclosed in his examination is 
directly contrary or repugnant to the doctrine of the church 

 on a consideration of the articles it appears that besides this 
particular pointy there are others which are left undecided it is 
not particularly declared what is the distinct meaning and effect 
of tne grace of regeneration— whether it is a change of nature 
a change of condition or a change of the relation subsisting be 
tween sinful man and his creator and there are other points 
which may very plainly be open to different considerations m dif 
ferent cases 

 upon the points which were left open differences of opinion 
could not be avoided even wnongst those who sincerely subscribed 
to the articles and that such differences amongst such persons 
were thought consistent with subscription to the articles and 
were not contemplated with disapprobation appears from a pas 
sagje in the boyal declaration now prefixed to the articles and 
wfiich was first added in the reign of king charles i long after 
the articles were finally settled — though some differences have 
been illraised yet we take comfort in this that au clergymen

vithin our realm liave always most willingly subscribed to the 
articles established which is an argument to us that they all 
agree in the true usual literal meaning of the said articles and 
that even in those curious points in which the present differences 
lie men of all sorts take the articles of the church of england to he 
for them which is an aijgument agam that none of them intend 
any desertion of the articles established 

 if the articles which constitute the code of fahk aad from 
which any differences are prohibited nevertheless contain expres 
sions which unavoidably admit of different constructions — and mem 
bers of the church are left at lioerty to draw from the articles 
different inferences in matters of faith not expressly decided and 
upon such points to exercise their private judgments — we may 
reasonably expect to find such differences of opinion allowable in the 
interpretation of the devotional services which were framed not 
for the purpose of determininff points of faith but of establish 
ing to use the expression of tne statute of elizabeth an uniform 
oraer of common prayer and of the administration of sacraments 
rites and ceremonies of the church of england 

we express no opinion upon the theological accuracy of 
these opinions or any of them the writers whom we have cited 
are not always consistent with themselves and other writers 
mat eminence and worthy of great respect have held and pub 
fished very different opinions hut the mere fact that such opinions 
have been propounded and maintained by persons so eminent and 
so much respected as well as by very many others appears to us 
sufficiently to prove that the liberty which was left by the articles 
and formularies has been actually enjoyed and exercised by the 
members and ministers of the church of england 

 the case not requiring it we have abstamed from expressing 
any opinion of our own upon the theological correctness or error 
of the doctrine of mr gorham which was discussed before us at 
such great length and with so much learning his honour the 
vicechancellor knight bruce dissents from the opifdon we have 
formed but all the other members of the judicial committee who 
were present are unanimously agreed in opinion — that the doc 
trine held by mr gorham is not contrary or repugnant to the de 
clared doctrine of the church of england as by law estabfished 
and that mr gorham ought not by reason of the doctrine held 
by him to have been refused admission to the vicarage of bramp 
ford speke 

 and we shall therefore humbly report to her majesty that 
the sentence pronounced by the learned judffe in the arches 
court of canterbury ought to be reversed and that it ought to 
be declared that the lord bishop of exeter has not shown suffi 
cient cause why he did not institute mr gorham to the said 
vicarage

quotations from theologians of high reputation will pro

of my own — 

i a summaby of thb principal evidences for the 
truth and divine origin op the christian revelation 
by bishop porteus 

 from considering the state of the heathen world 
before the appearance of our lord upon earth it is evident 
that there was an absolute necessity for a revelation of 
gods will and of course a great probability beforehand 
that such a revelation would be granted 

 at the very time when there was a general expec 
tation in the world of some extraordinary personage mak 
ing his appearance in it a person called jesus christ did 
actually appear upon earth asserting that he was the son 
of god and that he was sent from heaven to teach mankind 
true religion and he did accordingly found a religion 
which from him was called the christian religion and 
which has been professed by great numbers of people from 
that time to the present 

 the books of the new testament were written by 
those persons to whom they are ascribed and contain a 
mthful history of christ and his rdigion and the account 
there given of both may be securely relied upon as strictly 
true 

 the scriptures of the old testament which are 
connected with those of the new are the genuine writings 
of those whose names they bear and give a true accoimt 
of the mosaic dispensation of the lustorical facts the 
divine commands the moral prece and the prophecies 
which they contain 

 the character of christ as represented in the gros 
pels affords very strong ground fbr believing that he was a 
divine person 

 the sublimity of his doctrines and the purity of 
lu moral precepts confirm this belie£

 the rapid and successful propagation of the gospel 
by the first teachers of it through a large part of the wwld 
is a proof that they were fiaivoured with divine assistaooe 
and support 

 a comparison betwixt christ and mahomet and 
their respective religions leads us to conclude that as 
the religion of the latter was confessedly the invention of 
man that of the former was derived firom god 

 the predictions delivered by the ancient prophets 
and fulfilled in our saviour ow that he was the messiah 
expected by the jews and that he came into the woiid by 
divine appointment to be the great deliverer and re 
deemer of mankind 

 the prophecies delivered by our saviour himself 
prove that he was endued with the foreknowledge of future 
events which belongs only to god aud to those inspired 
by him 

 the miracles performed by our lord demonstrate 
him to have possessed divine power 

 the resurrection of our lord firom the dead is 
a fact fully proved by the clearest evidence and is the seal 
and confirmation of his divinity and of the truth of his 
divinity 

ii internal evidences op the divine inspiration op 
the scriptures by dr raffles 

 the christian religion assumes that the bible is the 
word of god that the books of the old and new testa 
ment are divinely inspired and that being so they con 
tain a revelation of his will now the proof of this 
proposition is of two kinds the first unbracing those 
evidences which are external arising fiom prophecy fixm 
miracles from the testimony of ancient heathen writers 
and the like the second embracing those which are in 
temal and which are furnished by the character and the 
discoveries of the book itself the principles and spirit by 
which it is pervaded and the influence which it exerts upon 
the condition and conduct of mankind it is to this latt 
kind of evidence that your attention is to be directed this 
evening and i may be permitted to observe that while 
the external evidences of divine revelation have been most

seasoning from written documents 

frequently adduced and illustrated i cannot but regard 
the internal evidences after all as most satisfactory and 
conclusive 

i now proceed to enumerate the principal articles of 
internal evidence of the divine inspiration and authority 
of the scriptures of the old and new testament 

 the first i would specify is the nohu and rational 
theology of the old testament compared with the low state 
of literature and philosophy amongst the jews in the 
second place i would specify as another article of internal 
eridence the moral precepts especially of the new tes 
tament thirdly the bible supplies the purest noblest 
and most powerful motives to holiness and virtue — motives 
indeed which deists reject though they cannot but admire 
the effects they uniformly produce in the character and 
conduct of such as live habitually beneath their influence 
i proceed to specify fourthly the spirit breathed through 
out the holy scriptures it is such as highly becomes 
what they profess to be — a revelation from god in the 
fifth place i would mention the candour and impartiality 
of the writers of the new testament in the sixth place 
there is in the bible and especially in the discourses of 
our lord an originality of manner which one would 
imagine could not fail to stnte even the most careless and 
inattentive reader in the seventh place an argument 
of great importance is derived from the perfect conformity 
of ike facts and occmrences mentioned or alluded to by 
the sacred writers and especially of the new testament 
with the accoimts preserved in history and other authen 
tic records altogether foreign and independent but a 
still more powerful argument in the eighth place in 
fevour of the inspiration of the sacred scriptures arises 
from the perfect and on their part obviously undesigned 
cmiddences between the sacred writers themselves we 
now proceed in the ninth place to mention as another 
article of internal evidence the positive instittuions ob 
served both by jews and christiafis that there are 
such institutions observed to the present hour is a thing 
sufficiently notorious as for instance the passover the 
feast of tabernacles and circumcision amongst the jews 
nd baptism the lords supper and the ministry of the

gospel amongst christians in the tenth place the most 
inveterate opponents of christianitj cannot but admirs 
its efects an the character and conduct of those who feel 
the strong influence of its motives and act undor the 
guidance of its principles finally we may specify as 
the last article of internal evidence of the divine inspira 
tion of the scriptures their influence on the general 
condition of society never did a nation become worse 
for its reception of the gospel on the contrary wherever 
it has been introduced in proportion to the cordiality 
with which it has been welcomed have been its salutary 
and beneficial consequences in the moral and social oondi 
tion of that people 

 and now on a revie of the argument at what con 
clusion are you prepared — are you compelled — in all 
honesty and fairness to arrive there is the book there 
is the system whence is it — from earth or heaven 
what is its origin — human or divine human it cannot 
be for if it were it would be a feble and a forgery — a 
fable and a forgery too cunningly devised for human skill 
and in the principles and spirit with which it is pervaded 
too pure and holy for so base a purpose or so gross an 
origin human ingenuity cotud not produce it human 
depravity would not if it could then if it be not human 
there is no other alternative — it must be divine — lec

not a single quotation from the apocrypha in either the old or

been written by solomon and yet the writer whoever he may

i v— different degrees of assent by dr watts 

 there are many things even in religion as well as in 
philosophy and civil life which we believe with very 
different degrees of assent and this is or should be always 
regulated according to the different degrees of evidence 
wbach we enjoy and perhaps there are a thousand grada 
tions in our assent to the things we believe because there 
are thousands of circumstances relating to different ques 
tions which increase or diminish the evidence we have 
 concerning them and that in matters both of reason and 
revelation 

i believe there is a god and that obedience is due to him 
from every reasonable creature this i am most fully assured of 
because i have the strongest evidence since it is the plain dictate 
both of reason and revelation 

 again i believe there is a future resurrection of the dead

beoaose scripture tells us so in the plainest terms thoiigh reason 
says notliiiiff of it i believe also that the same matter of our 
bodies which died in part at least shall arise but i am not so 
fully assured of this circumstance because the revelation of it is 
not quite so clear and express yet further i believe that the 
good men who were acquamted here on earth shall know each 
other in heaven but my persuasion of it is not absolutely cer 
tain because my assent to it arises only from circumstantial 
reasoning of men upon what god has told us and therefore my 
evidences are not strong beyond a possibility of mistake 

what is said before concerning truth or doctrines maybe 
also affirmed concerning duties the reason of both is the same 
as the one are truths for our speculation the others are truths for 
our practice duties which are expressly required in the plain 
language of scripture or dictated by the most evident reasoning 
upon first principles oujght to bind our consciences more than 
those which are but dubiously inferred and that only from occa 
sional occurrences incidents and circumstances as for instance 
i am certain that i ought to pray to god my cocience is 
bound to this because there are most evident commands for it to 
be found in scripture as well as to be derived from reason i 
believe jjso that i may pray to god either by a written form or 
without one because neither reason nor revelation expressly 
requires either of these modes of prayer at all times or forbiu 
the other i cannot therefore bind my conscience to practise 
the one so as uttly to renounce the other but i would practise 
either of them as my reason and other circumstances direct me

ture aud thus supplementing the partial information of one portion 
by ihe fuller information of anotner nay not only so but the 
truth even where most folly revealed is generedly stated in an 
indirect and incidental form i know not that a dnale instance 
can be produced of a doctrine announced in the shape of an 
abstract proposition the articles of our faith are all exhibited 
but they are not ropounded in their naked form as in human 
creeds and confessions — they are never introduced but in con 
nexion with something of a practical nature if we are taught 
for example the doctrine of the trini we are taught it not in 
express terms but indirectly as in christs commission to the 
aposdes if we are taught the doctrine of the atonement we 
are taught it— not abstractlv as a mere article qf faith but prac 
tically as an illustration of the divine love or as a proof of the 
malignity of sin or as an incentive to gratitude and noliness in 
short the christian doctrines are revealed — not in an insulated 
form but obliquely and incidentally — here in a narrative of facts 
there in the course of an amiment — here as thinp to be pre 
supposed there as things to be inferred — now in plain and literal 
tems now under the veil of metaphor and allegory so that in 
order to ascertain the real amount of the system of theology and 
morals which the bible reveals it is necessary to explore the 
whole sacred territory — to compare book with book and passage 
with passage— to collect from each its peculiar contribution — and 
to couate tne whole into one systematic body 

the bible observe is not one book but a collection of sixt 
six different books it is the production not of one writer but of 
thirtysix different writers — men of every diversity of rank talent 
and mental culture — from the monarch to the gatherer of syca 
more froit from the accomplished pupil of gamaliel to the un 
lettered fisherman of galilee it is a work moreover not of one 
age but of many and distant ages the opening books date six 
hundred years earlier than any other literary composition extant 
while the closing book is a production of the age of the csesars 
the whole is the connected literature of a period not short of 
fifteen centuries then how various are the books in kind some 
are histories some biographies some poems some digests of 
public law some collections of national proverbs some epistles 
to churches some private letters to friends nor are their 
subjects less diversified than the dates and the authors instead 
of discussing only one or two points they discuss a thousand — 
and these the most profound and perplexing within the whole 
range of human inquiry the most unfavourable to unity of senti 
ment the most vexed by controversy and debate 

 now certainly it could never have been expected beforehand 
on any ordinary grounds of probability that a series of works 
open to so many sources of mversity should exhibit such a thing

errors in reasoning 

thb art of fejse reasoning is of great antiquity it is 
nearly as old as the creation we learn from the bible 
that it was first discovered and successftdly made use of 
by the angel of deceit when in the apparent light of 
reason he availed himself of the serpents ingenuity to 
aeduce our first parents from their state of happiness to his 
own state of misery — from a state of peaceful enjoyment 
ttie natural consequence of obedience to their creator to 
a state of misery the neverfailing result of disobedience 
this art is very simple in itself and may easily be acquired 
by any one who possesses an ordinary fehare of the actors 
talent and is endowed with a persuasive tongue and an 
unscrupulous conscience 

the process as set forth in thd third chapter of the 
first book in the bible is very short and simple a doubt 
as to the truth of gods word isrst ingeniously suggested 
— yea hath god said ye shall surely not eat of every 
tree of the garden v then the trtuh of that word is 
positively denied — ye shall not surely die and lastly 
the expediency of acting in opposition to the command 
of grod is adroitly introduced into the argument of the 
archdeceiver namely the beauty of the fruit and its 
virtue to tnake wise those that partake of it — god doth 
know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall 
be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil 

 this kind of reasoning seldom fails to succeed with 
persons who are themselves imconscious of deceit if they 
once begin to palter with the truth — if error be alioweii 
to insinuate the first doubt of the truthfulness of gods 
word but to perfect the delusion the plea in a false 
argument should not be altogether false — a little truth 
should be interwoven with it — truth so stated as to con 
stitute a practical lie in the case just stated the great 
deceiver spoke truth when he told the woman that after 
she had tasted the forbidden fruit her eyes would be 
opened to discern both good and evil — so it proved

idtherto adam and herself had known only good now 
to their sorrow they knew what evil was also 

 but in these latter days the art of false reasoning has 
been greatly elaborated the short straightforward pro 
cess adopted by the inventor of the science would scarcely 
answer ike purposes to which it is now apphed the mis 
chievoufl result which was then attained in a day is now 
often made the work of years requiring the support of 
many positive and reiterated denials of the truth for its 
completion sometimes we see one error established and 
the supposed impossibility of uproting it made the rea 
son for engrafting upon it many others at other times 
a dexterous transposition of the right order of tilings — 
inverting the order of cause and eflfect or in other words 
putting the cart before the horse — proves a very suc 
cessful method of thwarting the truth and of preparing 
the way for the establishment of mse conclusions but 
when the truth to be opposed is so selfevidently true as to 
baffle every attempt to find a plausible argument against 
it the advocate of error may even then possibly succeed 
by availing himself of the power of ridicule — the power 
of which is oftentimes the greater in its effect upon shd 
lowminded men in proportion as the truth which it assails 
is grave and important this may occasionally be seen

although no wise man would wish to make use of this

natural and acquired but to guard against its mischievous 
power the only qualifications which are essentially neces 
sary are a sound judgment and a sincere love of the truth 
and these qualifications are happily within the reach of 
every honest man though jm sphere may be ever so 
hitime and his literary acquirements equally small when 
it has mien to the lot of any of these himible disciples of 
the truth to become its active advocates they have often 
accomplished by a few words judiciously spoken effects 
most beneficial to mankind we are told that the truly 
great general washington rarely required so much as ten 
minutes to give utterance to the remarks which he had to 
offer to the american senate and it may generally be 
assumed that where a practised speaker requires an hour 
or two to make a speech on a simple question and has the 
power of charming his hearers for that length of time 
there is great reason for his audience to be on their guard 
lest the brilliancy of the orator should conceal some dupli 
city in his argument but wherever this duplicity does 
exist the more any one is acquainted with the devices of 
the felse reasoner the better able he will of course be to 
detect and expose the cloven foot which even in these days 
may sometimes be found imder a garment of light — the 
art of false reasoning exemplified 

the different kinds of false reasons are called sophisms 
or fiillacies we shall take our description of these falla 
cies chiefly firom dr watts but classified according to our 
own arrangement of the principles of reasoning 

false reasons may assume any of the following forms — 

i — fallacies arising firom not understanding the ques 
tion see page 

 proving a different question fixm that in dispute — 

the first sort of sophism is called ignoratio elenchi 
or a mistake of the question that is when something 
else is proved which has neither any necessary connexion 
wr consistency with the thing inquired and consequently 
ves no determination to the inquiry though it may seem 
at first sight to determine the question as if any should 
ccmclude that st paul was not a native jew by proving

that he was bom a roman or if they should pretend to 
determine that he was neither roman nor jew by proving 
that he was bom at tarsus in cilicia these sophisms ai 
refuted by showing that all these three may be true for 
he was bom of jewish parents in the city of tarsus and 
by some peculiar privilege granted to his parents or his 
native city he was bom a denizen of rome thus tfaeife 
is neither of these three characters of the apostle incon 
sistent with each other and therefore the proving one of 
them true does not refute the others — wcotss logic 

 assuming as tme the question in dispute — 

 the next sophism is called pduio prtndpii or a sup 
position of what is not granted that is when any propo 
sition is proved by the same proposition in other iords or 
by sometiiing that is equally uncertain and disputed as 
if any one undertake to prove that the human soul is 
extended through all the parts of the body because it 
resides in every member which is but the same thing in 
other words or if a papist should pretend to prove that 
his religion is the only catholic religion and is derived 
from christ and his apostles because it agrees with the 
doctrine of lall the fathers of the church all the holy 
martyrs and all the christian world throughout all ages 
whereas this is the great point in contest whether their 
religion does agree with that of all the ancients and the 
primitive christians or no 

 that sort of fallacy which is called a circle is very 
near akin to the petitio prindpii as when one of the 
premises in a syllogism is questioned and opposed and we 
intend to prove it by the conclusion or when in a train 
of syllogisms we prove the last by recurring to what was 
the conclusion of the first the papists are famous at 
this sort of fiallacy when they prove the scripture to be 
the word of god by the authority or infallible testimony 
of their church and when they are called to show the 
infallible authority of their church they pretend to prove 
it by the scripture — ibid 

 abusing the ambiguity of words which may be done 
m different ways —

jebbobs in rasoning 

 the next sort of sophisms arises from our abuse of the 
lodbiguity of words which is the largest and most exten 
sive kind of llacy and indeed several of the other mia 
mea might be reduced to this head 

 when the words or phrases are plainly equivocal they 
are called sophisms of equivocation as if we should argue 
thus he that sends forth a book into the ught desires 
it to be read he that throws a book into the fire sends it 
into the light therefore he that throws a book into the 
fire desires it ta be read 

 this sophism as well as the foregoing and all of the 
like nature are solved by showing the different senses of 
the words terms or phrases here light in the major 
proposition signifies the public view of the world in the 
minor it signifies the brightness of flame and fire and 
therefore the syllogism has four terms or rather it has no 
middle term and proves nothing 

 but where such gross equivocations and ambiguities 
appear in arguments there is little danger of imposing 
upon ourselves or others the greatest danger and which 
we are perpetually exposed to in reasoning is where the 
two senses or significations of one term are near akin and 
not plainly distinguished and yet they are really suffi 
ciently different in their sense to lead us into great mis 
takes if we are not watchful and indeed the greatest 
part of controversies in the sacred or civil life arise from 
the different senses that are put upon words and the dif 
ferent ideas which are included in them — ibid 

ii — fallacies connected with the relation of subject and 
attribute see page 

 judging of a thing by that which only belongs to it 
accidentally — 

the next is called falladadccidmtis or a sophism 
wherein we pronounce concerning the nature and essential 
properties of any subject according to something which is 
merely accidental to it this is akin to the former and is 
also very frequent in human life so if opium or the peru 
vian bark has been used imprudently or imsuccessfully 
whereby the patient has received injury some weaker

 logic fob thb miluon 

people absolutely pronotmoe against the tise of the bark or 
opium upon all occasions whatsoever and are ready to 
call them poison so wine has been the accidental occa 
sion of drunkenness and quarrels learning and printing 
may have been the accidental cause of sedition in a state 
the reading of the bible by accident has been abused to 
promote heresies or destructiye errors and for these rea 
sons they have all been pronounced evil things mahomet 
forbade his followers the use of wine the turks discourage 
learning in their dominions and the psists forbid the 
scripture to be read by the laity but how very imreason 
able are these inferences and these prohibitions which are 
built upon them — ibid 

 passing om what is true in some respects to what 
is true absolutely — 

 the next sophism borders upon the former and that 
is when we argue from that which is true in particular 
circumstances to prove the same thing true absolutely 
simply and abstracted from all circumstances this is 
called in the schools a sophism a dicto secundum quid 
ad dictum dmpliciter as that which is bought in the 
shambles a eaten for dinner raw meat is bought in the 
shambles therefore raw meat is eaten for dinner or 
thus livy writes fobles and improbabilities when he de 
scribes prodigies and omens therefore livys roman 
history is never to be believed in anything or thus 
there may be some mistake of transcribers in some part 
of scripture therefore scripture alone is not a safe guide 
for our fidth 

 this sort of sophism has its reverse also as when we 
argue from that which is true simply and absolutely to 
prove the same thing true in all particular circumstances 
whatsoever as if a traitor should argue from the sixth 
commandment thou shalt not kill a man to prove 
that he himself ought not to be hanged or if a madman 
should tell me i ought not to withhold his sword fim 
him because no man ought to withhold the property of 
another 

 these two last species of sophisms are easily solved 
by showing the difference betwixt things in their absolute

cumstances and considered in regard to special times 
places persons and occasions or by showing the diflfer 
ence between a moiul and a metaphysical imiversality and 
that the proposition will hold good in one case but not in 
the other— ic 

 the two errors in reasoning to which scholastic 
logicians give the names of undistributed middle and 
 illicit process may be classed under this head the 
 undistributed middle is when we argue that because 
two things have a common attribute therefore they are 
the same thing as gold is yellow and saflfron is yellow 
— therefore saffiron is gold the illicit process is when 
because two things are not the same thing we infer 
they have not a dommon attribute as gold is yel

passing from a divided sense to a connected sense or 
from a connected sense to a divided sense — 

 tlie sophisms of composition and division come next to 
be mentioned the sophism of composition is when we infer 
anything concerning ideas in a compounded sense which is 
only true in a divided sense and when it is said in the gospel

 the sophism of division is when we infer the same 
thing concerning ideas in a divided sense which is only 
true in a compounded sense as if we should pretend to 
prove that every soldier in the grecian army put an 
hundred thousand persians to flight because the grecian 
soldiers did so or if a man should argue thus five is 
one number two and three are five therefore two and 
three are one number — ihid

 misapplication of general principles — 

 a third example is the opposition sometimes made to 
legitimate interferences of government in the economical 
affiurs of society groimded upon a misapplication of the 
maxim that an individual is a better judge than the govern 
ment of what is for his own pecuniary interest this objec 
tion was urged to mr wakefields system of colonization 
one of the greatest practical improvements in public affairs 
which have been made in our time mr wakefields prin 
ciple as most people are now aware is the artificial concen 
tration of the settlers by fixing such a price upon un 
occupied land as may preserve the most desirable proportion 
between the quantity of land in cultiure and the labouring 
population against this it was argued that if individuals 
found it for their advantage to occupy extensive tracts of 
land they being better judges of their own interest thai 
the legislature which can only proceed on general rules 
ought not to be restrained from doing so but in this 
argument it was forgotten that tiie fact of a mans taking

a large tract of land is evidence only that it is his interest 
to take as much as other people but not that it might not 
be for his interest to content himself with less if he could 
be assured that other people would do so too an assurance 
ch nothing but a government regulation can give if 
all other people took much and he only a little he would 
reap none of the advantages derived from the concentration 
of the population and the consequent possibility of pro 
curing labour for hire but would have placed himself 
without equivalent in a situation of voluntary inferiority 
the proposition therefore that the quantity of land which 
people will take when left to themselves is that which it 
is most for their interest to take is true only secundum 
quid it is only their interest while they have no guarantee 
for the conduct of one another but the argument dis 
regards the limitation and takes the proposition for true 
timpliciter 

 under the same head of fallacy dicto secundum quid 
ad dictum simplidter might be placed all the errors which 
are vulgarly called misapplications of abstract truths that 
is where a principle true as the common expression is m 
the abstract that is all modifying causes being supposed 
absent is reasoned upon as if it were true absolutely and 
no modifying circumstances could ever by possibility

taking for a cause that which is not a cause — 

 the next kind of sophism is called non catudpro causd 
or the assignation of a mse cause this the peripatetic 
philosophers were guilty of continually when they told us 
that certain beings which they called substantial forms 
were the springs of colour motion vegetation and the 
tarious operations of natui beings in the animate and 
inanimate world when they inform us that nature was 
terribly afraid of a vacuum and that this was the cause 
why the water would not ml out of a long tube if it was 
turned upside down the modems as well as the ancients 
fidl often into this fallacy when they positively assign the 
reasons of natrntd appeaianoes without sufficient experi 
ments to prove them 

 astrologers are overrun with this sort of fallacies and 
they cheat the people grossly by pretending to tell for 
tunes and to deduce the cause of the various occurrences 
in the lives of men from the various positions of the stars 
and planets which they call aspects 

 when comets and eclipses of the sun and moon are 
construed to signify the fete of princes the revolution of 
states famine wars and calamities of all kinds it is a 
fellacy that belongs to this rank of sophisms

 how frequent is it among men to impute crimes to 
wrong persons we too often charge that upon the wicked

arose merely from ignorance or from an unguarded tem

excuse ourselves we practise the same sophism andharge 
that upon our inadvertence or our ignorance which per

and again we charge that upon necessity which was really 
desired and chosen 

 sometimes a person acts out of judgment in opposition 
to his inclinalion another person perhaps acts the same 
tiling out of inclination and against his judgment it is 
hard for us to determine with assurance what are the in

vii — fallacies connected with the relation of analogy 
comparison and contrast see page 

 but this is only one of the modes of error in the 
employment of arguments of analogy there is another 
more properly deserving the name of fallacy namely when 
iiesemblance in one point is inferred from resemblance in 
another point although there is not only no evidence to 
connect the two circumstances by way of causation but the 
evidence tends positively to disconnect them this is pro 
perly the fallacy of false analogies 

 as a first mstance we may cite that fiivourite argu 
ment in defence of absolute power drawn from the analogy 
of paternal government in a family which government is 
not and by universal admission ought not to be controlled 
hy though it sometimes ought to be controlled for the 
children paternal government in a mily works well 
therefore says the argument despotic government in a 
state will work well implying that the beneficial working 
of parental government depends in the femily upon the 
only point which it has in common with political despotism 
namely irresponsibility whereas it does not depend upon 
that but upon two other attributes of parental goveni 
ment the afifection of the parent for the children and the 
superiority of the parent in wisdom and experience neither 
of which properties can be reckoned upon or are at all 
likely to exist between a political despot and his subjects 
and when either of these circumstances fails even in the 
family and the influence of the irresponsibility is allowed 
to work imcorrected the result is anything but good 
government this therefore is a dse analogy 

 another example is the not imcommon dictum that 
bodies politic have youth maturity old age and death 
like lodie natural that after a certain duration of pro 
 sperity they tend spontaneously to decay this also is a 
le analogy because the decay of the vital powers in an 
animated body can be distinctly traced to the natiural pro 
gress of those very changes of structure which in their 
earlier stages constitute its growth to maturity while in

 i suppose it will not be denied that the three following arc 
among the most important points to be ascertained in deciding 
on the credibility of witnesses first whether they have the 
means of gaining correct information secondly whether they 
have an intereit in concealmg truth or propagating falsehood 
and thirdly whether they agree in their testimony let us 
examine the present witnesses upon all these points 

 first what means have the editors of newspapers for gaining 
correct information p we know not except from their own state 
ments besides what is copied from other journals foreign or 
british which is usually more than threefourths of the news 
published they profess to refer to the authority of certain pri 
vate corresponaents abroad who these correspondents are wnat 
means they have of obtaining information or whether they exist 
at all we have no way of ascertainin we find ourselves in the 
condition of the hindoos who are lold by their priests that the 
earth stands on an elephant and the elephant on a tbrtoise but 
are left to find out for themselves what tne tortoise stands on or 
whether it stands on anything at all 

 so much for our clear knowledge of the means of information 
possessed by these witnesses next for the grounds on which we 
are to calculate on their veracity 

 have they not a manifest interest in circulating the won 
derful accounts of napoleon buonaparte and his achievements 
whether true or false p few would read newspapers if they did 
not sometimes find wonderful or important news in them and 
we may safely say that no subject was ever found so inexhaustibly 
interesting as the present 

 still it will be said that unless we suppose a regularly pre 
concerted plan we must at least expect to find great oiscre 
pancies in the accoimts published though they might adopt 
the general outline of facts one from another they wouh have to 
fill up the detail for themselves and in this therefore we should 
meet with infinite and irreconcileable variety 

 now this is precisely the point i am tending to for the fao 
exactly accords with the above supposition the discordance and 
mutual contradictions of these witnesses being such as would 
alone throw a considerable shade of doubt over their testimony 
it is not in minute circumstances alone that the discrepancy 
appears such as might be expected to appear in a narrative sub 
stantially true but in very great and leading transactions and 
such as are very intimately connected with the supposed hero

been suspected by others besides me of having never even been 
near the great man and having fabricated the whole story for the 
sake of making a gain of the credulity of travellers 

it appears then that those on whose testimony the existence 
and actions of buonaparte are generalli believed fail in all the 
most essential points on which the credibility of witnesses depends 
first we have no assurance that they have access to correct infor 
mation secondly they have an apparent interest in propating 
falsehood and tmrdly they palpably contradict each other in the 
most important points 

but what shall we say to the testimony of those many 
respectable persons who went to plymouth on purpose and saw 
buonaparte with their own eyes must they not trust their 
senses r i would not disparage either the eyesight or the vera 
citj of these gentlemen i am ready to allow tmtt they went to 
plymouth for the purpose of seeing buonaparte nay more that 
tliey actually rowed out into the narbour in a boat and came 
abngside of a manofwar on whose deck they saw a man in a 
cocked hat who thef were told was buonaparte this is the 
nhnost point to which their testimonv roes how they ascer 
tained that this man in the cocked hat haa gone through all the 
marrellous and romantic adventures with wmck we have so long 
been amused we are not told 

there js one more circumstance which i cannot forbear 
mentioning because it so much adds to the air of fiction which 
perrades every part of this marvellous tale and that is the 
mcoonaliiy of it 

 buonaparte prevailed over all the hostile states in turn except 
land in the zenith of his power hia fleets were swept from 
the sea by england his troops always defeat an equal and e 
quen even a superior number of those of any other nation 
fxct the enalieh and with them it is just the reverse twice 
and twice only he is personally engaged against an english com 
nder and both times he is totafly defeated at acre and at 
waterloo and to crown all enalam finally crashes this tremen 
dons power which had so long kept the continent in subjection 
or in alarm and to the mrgluk he surrenders himself prisoner 
thoroughly national to be sure it my be all very time but

 — timeherving in religion — 

 btends — my brethren we are as you see going all on pil 
grimage and for our better diversion from things that are bad 
give me leave to propound unto you this question 

 suppose a man a minister or a tradesman c should have an 
advantage lie before him to get the good blessings of this life yet 
so as that he can by no means come by them except in appear 
ance at least he becomes extraordinary zealous in some points of 
religion that he meddled not with before may he not use this 
means to attain his end and yet be a right honest man 

monetlove— i see the bottom of your question and with 
these gentlemens good leave i will endeavour to shape you an 
answer and first to speak to your question as it ooncemeth a 
muiister himself suppose a minister a worthy man possessed 
but of a very small benefice and has in his eye a eater more 
fat and plump by far he has also now an opportunity of getting 
it yet so as by beinc more studious by preacning more frequently 
and zealously and because the temper of the people requires i 
by altering of some of his principles for my part i see no reason 
why a man may not do this provided he has a cajl ay and more 
a great deal besides and yet oe an honest man for why p 

 his desire of a greater benefice is lawful this cannot be 
contradicted since it is set before him by providence so then 
he may get it if he can making no questiwi for conscience sake 

 besides his desire after that benefice makes him more 
studious a more zealous preacher o and so makes him a better 
man yea makes him better improve his parts which is according 
to the mind of god 

 now as for his complying with the temper of his people 
by deserting to serve them some of his principles this argueth 
 that he is of a selfdenying temper of a sweet and 
winning deportment and so more fit for the ministerial 
function 

 i conclude then that a minister that changes a small for 
a ctcat should not for so doin be judged as covetous but 
rather since he is improved in his parts and industry hweby be 
counted as one that pursues his call and the opportunity put into 
his hand to do good 

and now to the second part of the question which concerns 
the tradesman you mentioned suppose such an one to have but 
a poor employ in the world but bv becoming religious he may 
mend his market perhaps get a ricn wife or more and far better

customers to his shop for my part i see no reason but tls may 
be lawfolly done for why p 

 to become religious is a virtue by what means soever a 
man becomes so 

 nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife or more custom to 
my shop 

 besides the man that gets these by becoming religious 
gets that which is good of them that are good by becoming good 
himself so then her is a good wife and ooa customers and 
good gain and all these by oecoming religious which is good 
therefore ta become religious to get all these is a good and pro 
fitable design — bunyaifi filgrim progress 

 — mental reservation — 

 verity and falsity being proprieties of an enunciative speech 
as aristotle teacheth us that is of that speech either conceived 
only in the mind or uttered by words or writing by which we 
affirm or deny anything — which we call a proposition — that we 
may the better uscem this verity and falsily we must needs 
consider the variety of propositions and we may say with the 
logicians tiiat there be four kinds of propositions the first is 
a mental proposition only conceived in the mind and not uttered 
by any extior signmcation as when i think with myself these 
words god is not unjust the second is a vocal proposition 
as when utter those words with my month the third is a 
written proposition as if i should set the same down in writing 
the last ot all is a mixed proposition when we mingle some of 
these propositions or parts of them together as in our purpose 
when bedi demandea whether john at style be in such a place 
i knowing that he is there indeed do say nevertheless i know 
not — reserving or understanding within myself these other 
words to the end for to tell you here is a mixed proposition 
containing all this — i know not to the end for to tell you 
and vet part of it is expressed part reserved inthe mind 

 our saviour said to his disciples that he himself knew not 
the day of judgment but his father only which by consent of 
the holy fathers is to be understood that he knew it not for to 
litter it although they were never so desirous to know it wnereas 
bis father knowing it had uttered it unto him as man for other 
wise we know that st peter truly said lord thou knowest 
all things and st paul affirmeth that in ghnst were hidden 
all the easnres of the wisdom and knowledge of god so that 
it is a catholic verity that he knew the day and hour of his 
dreadful judgment notwithstandinff this equivocal sentence 
wherein he seemeth to deny that he had any such knowledge 

besides these kinds of propositions which we have hitherto 
defended not to be lies although by them always some truth is 
l

 logic for thb million 

concealed there be some other ways whereby without a lie a 
truth may be covered which x will briefly set down 

 first we may use some equivocal word which hath many 
significations and we understand it in one sense which is true 
although the hearer conceive the other which is false so did 
abraham and isaac say that their wives were their sisters which 
was not true as the hearers understood it or in the proper mean 
ing whereby a sister signifieth one bom of the same father or 
mother or of both but in a general signification whereby a 
brother or sister signifieth one near of kindred as abraham called 
lot his brother who was but his brothers son and our lord is 
said to have had brothers and sisters whereas properly he had 
neither the like unto this were if one should be asked whether 
such a stranger lodgeth in my house and i should answer he 
lieth not in my house meaning that he doth not tell a lie there 
although he lodge there 

 secondly when unto one question may be given many 
answers we may yield one and conceal the other so samud 
being commanded by god to go to bethlehem to anoint david 
king said unto god how shall i go for saul will hear of it 
and kill me and our liord said thou shalt take a calf out 
the herd and shalt say i oome to do sacrifice to our lord and 
samuel did as our lord said unto him and came into bethlehem 
but the ancients of the city wondering thereat met him and 
said is thy coming peaceable who answered it is peace 
able i am come to do sacrifice unto our lord here samuel 
uttered the secondary cause of his coming and warily dissembled 
the principal which notwithstanding they princially intended to 
know ana by this answer were put out of suspicion thereof so 
may it happen that one coming to a place to iear mass may an 
swer them who ask the cause of his coming that he came to 
dinner or to visit some person who is there or with some other 
true alleged cause satisfy the demanders 

 tiirdlythe whole sentence which we pronounce or some 
word thereof or the manner of pointing or dividing the sentence 
may be ambiguous and we mav spetjt it in one sense true for our 
own advantage so it is recoraed of st francis that being asked 
of one who was sought for to death whether he came not thu 
way he answered putting his hand into his sleeve or as some say 
into his ear he came not this way 

 to these three ways of concealing a truth by words if we 
add the other of which we spoke before that is when we utter 
certain words which of themselves may engender a false conceit in 
the mind of the hearers and yet with somewhat which tf under 
stand and reserve in our minds maketh a true proposition then 
shall we have four ways how to conceal a truth without making 
of a lie — a treatise on equivocation

wb have now gentle reader passed through three parts of 
our work in the first part we considered the introduc

of the principles of keasoning in the third part we 
considered another class of the principles of beaning 
in this the fourth part we are going to consider the 
forms of beasoning but you may ask what is the differ 
ence between the principles of reasoning and the forms of 
reasoning the difference is this — the principle refers to 
the nature of the reason the form refers to the manner of 
expressing it the principle refers to ideas the form refers 
to the language and the method we will explain this by 
an example suppose in the morning your wife advises 
you to put on your greatcoat to prevent your taking cold 
here the principle of the argument is the relajtwn cause 
and effect and the validity pr strength of this argument 
must depend upon the soimdness of this principle in its 
application to the present case that is upon the proba 
bility that you will take cold if you do not wear your 
greatcoat but this argument may be proposed in a variety 
of forms she may say my dear put on your greatcoat 
this morning if you dont youll be sure to take cold 
or she may speak interrogatively why dont you put 
on your gireatcoat this morning do you wish to take 
cold again as you did before whats the use of having a 
greatcoat if you dont wear it such a day as this or she 
may speak syllogistically and say whenever you are in 
daor of taking cold you should put on a greatcoat i 
am sure you are in dtmger of taking cold this morning 
therefore this morning you should put on your great

we mean the different ways in which recuons may he placed 
before u the strength of an argument must depend 
upon the soundness of its principles but the readiness 
with which that strength is perceived will depend very 
often upon the manner in which the argument may be 
presented to the mind hence different arguments are 
drawn up in dififent ionns according to the subjects dis 
cussed and the character of the audience to whom they 
are addressed these different forms chiefly refer to the 
method and the style to be able to reason with the 
greatest effect we should study not only the rules of logic 
but also the rules of grammar and endeavour to acquire 
a feunlity of ecpressing the same ideas in different worda 
dr watts in his improvement of the mind has given us 
some rules for the acquisition of this useful talent — 

 accustom yoorselyes to read those authors who think and 
write with great clearness and evidence such as convey their 
ideas into vour understanding as fast as your eye or tongue can 
run over tneir sentences this will imprint upon the mind a habit 
of imitation we shall learn the style with which we are very 
conversant and practise it with ease and success 

 get a distinct and comprehensive knowledge of the sub 
ject which you treat of survey it on au sides and make yourself 
pect master of it then you will have all the sentiments that 
relate to it in your view and under your command and your 
tongue will very easily clothe those ideas with words which your 
mind has first made so familiar and easy to itself

 be well skilled in the language which you speak acquaint 
yourself with all the idioms and special phrases of it which are 
necessary to convey the needful ideas on the subject of which you 
treat in the most various and most easy manner to the under 
standing of the hearer the variation of a phrase in several forms 
is of admirable use to instruct it is like turning all sides of the 
subject to view and if the learner happens not to take in the 
ideas in one form of speech probably another may be successful 
for that end 

 upon this account i have always thought it a useful manner 
of instruction which is used in some latm scliools which they

call variation take some plain sentence in the english tongue 
and then turn it into many forms in latin as for instance a 
volf let into the sheepfold will devour the sheep if you let a 
wolf into the foli the shep will be devoured the wolf wiu 
devour the sheep if the sheepfold be left open if the fold be 
not left shut carefully the wolf will devour the sheep the sheer 
will be devoured bv the wolf if it find the way mto the fold 
open there is no defence of the sheep from the wolf unless it 
be kept out of the fold a slaughter wiu be made among the 
sheep if the wolf can get into the fold thus by turmng the 
active voice of verbs into the passive and the nominative case of 
nouns into the accusative and altering the connexion of short 
sentences by different adverbs or conjunctions and by ablative 
cases with a preposition brought instead of the nominative or by 
participles sometimes put instead of the verbs the negation of 
and the conlarary instead of the assertion of the thing first pro 
posed a great variety of forms of speech will be created which 
shall express the same sense 

 acquire a variety of wcords a copia verborum let your 
memoiy be rich in svnonymous terms or words expressinjg the 
same happy effect with the variation of the same thing this will 
not only attain the phrases in the foregoing direction but it will 
add a lieauty also to your style by securing you from an appear 
ance of tautology or repeatmg the same words too often which 
sometimes may cusgust toe ear of the learner 

 learn the art of shortening your sentences by dividing 
a long complicated period into two or three small ones when 
others connect and join two or three sentences in one by relative 
pronouns as which whereof wherein whereto c and by paren 
theses frequaitly inserted do you rather divide them into distinct 
periods or at least if they must be united let it be done rather 
dy conjunctions and copulatives that they may appear like distinct 
sentences and give less confusion to the hearer or reader 

 i know no method so ectualto learn what i mean as to 
take now and then some page of an author who is guilty of such 
a lon involved parenthetical style and translate it into plainer 
english by dividing the ideas or the sentences asunder and multi 
plying the periods till the language become smooth and easy and

whole and its parts sometimes will also give rise to de 
scriptive reasoning the description consista in the enmne 
ration of all the parts that compose the whole thus job 
describes his former prosperity job xxix — the 
punishment of the wicked is described with the same 
minuteness see job xxl — xxvii — and 
xviii — the relation of genus and species also 
gives rise to descriptive reasoning the description con 
sists in the enumeration of the species thus job describes 
the various kinds of wrongs perpetrated by wicked men 
job xxiv — v and we have also an enumeration 
of the various kinds of blessings bestowed on the 
righteous job xxii — the relation of cause and 
effect also is a source of description the description 
is usually a portraiture of the e£fect examples are 
narratives and are descriptions of past events see the 
section on examples analogies comparisons and con 
trasts are sometimes formed by lengthened descriptions 
see jlob iv — xiv — thus job contrasts his 
prosperity xxix — with his adversity xxx — 
parables fbhles and allegories are of course descriptions 
see psalms ixttx — in sacred poetry we often find 
that descriptions are given in the form of interrogations 
we have examples of this firequently in the psalms and 
the prophets and more especially in the thirtyeighth and 
thirtyninth chapters of the book of job 

descriptions are sometimes rendered more vivid by the 
use of that figure of rhetoric which is called amplification

oircumstances are mentioned and placed in sadi a way 
that the impression shall increase as you proceed and 
end in a climax hius it has been stated that in london 
one thousand young men die every year of consumption 
in consequence of their late hours of employment dr 
hamilton in a sermon on the subject thus amplifies the 
statement — 

 when a physician tells you that a thousand young men die 
every year of consumption caused by the shopsystem of the 
capital the statement makes httle impression it is a statistical 
fact and makes no apjjeal to the feelings but what does it 
imply it means that in consequence of this system if they all 
be collected in one consumption nospital a thousand younff men 
are stricken down before the prime of life with incurable and 
lingering disease it meahs that at the period of existence when 
ihe pulse should be the firmest and the zest of life the fullest 
a thousand youths are wasting away in racking pain and in the 
dreariness and dejection of hopeless invalidism it means that 
whi the yearly battle of competition is ended trade buries a 
thousand of its soldiers and votes no pensions to the widows 
whom it has bereft of sons or the sisters whom it has robbed of 
brothers it means that a thousand graves are digged and filled 
and that in these graves are entombed the hopes of many a 
family it means what statistics cannot tell it means — this list 
of a thousand untimely deaths— it means misery and mourning 
blasted prospects broken hearts desolate homes and it is to be 
feared sometimes the forfeited hope of heaven 

in the same way the apprehension of a fugitive slave is 
thus described in a newspaper called the jew york inde 
pendent —

guilty of no cnme who had pleacefttlly supported himself by his 
mdustry and economy in this city for two years past to whom 
life was as dear and liberlv as sweet as to any of us was taken 
by an officer of the unitea states government under the order 
 another officer of the same government and consigned to a 
bondage in the comparison of which no temporary imprisonment 
would dc other than insificant to a bondage that puts him 
completely at the disposal of an irresponsible master that denies 
him the right to wife or children except so long as the master 
allows that deprives him of property of liberty and of the

ly the following are practical applications of descrip 
tive reasoning 

in tracing the effects of any measure that we wish to have 
altered or abandoned the effects are sometimes described 
very minutely — 

the reasons against extracting a revenue out of soap are 
obvious and unanswerable in the first place it is a tax upon a 
necessary of life moreover it presses on the poor in a dispro 
portionate degree as compared with the rich since the duty bemg 
uniform on descriptions of the article the commoner qusdities 
pay of course a much larger per centage to the exchequer than 
those of higher price but the particular mode in wnich this 
duty affects the humbler classes makes it especially injurious to 
their interests it operates as a discouragement to cleanliness — 
a premium pro tanto upon dirt and disease to enhance by fiscal 
regulations the price of a commodity which is indispensable to 
the purification of the dwellings the apparel and the persons of 
the poor is to say the least a glaring contravention of the policy 
which has but latelv taken the nealth of the ueople under le 
tive protection ana which rards baths and washhouses cundn 
age and ventilation as fit objects of public care and official 
supervision 

but we have not yet done with the evils of the soap tax 
another wellfounded objection against it is that it operates like 
all excise duties on articles of manufacture injuriously upon 
production — exposing us to a disadvantageous rivalry wil the 
foreign maker and depressing what might otherwisse be a flourish 
ing branch of trade the same arguments in fact which induced 
sir k peel to take off the glass duties might be uied with 
almost the same force for repealing the duty upon soap lastly 
to complete the case of inexpediency the tax to which we refer 
does not extend to ireland a preference not only indefensible 
on grounds of justice but furthermore conducive as is well 
known to a great amount of evasion and fraud it has been a 
common practice to export ehgush soap with the benefit of the 
drawback to the sister country and merwards to smuggle the 
same back again to england thus defrauding at once the revenue 
and the manufacturer who honestly pays the duty — morning 
chronicle 

in describing acts of injustice or oppression it is seldom 
necessary to have recourse to any forms of reasoning the 
description itself will usually in this country produce all the 
impression that could be obtained by the most profound 
argumentation so also in regard to the abuses of the law

to show that they ought to be corrected it is enough to

dae from the testator a belieying that sufficient assets were in

v a logical description will have an adftation to the 
points it is designed to prove thus the description of a

titution and hence the descriptions though all correct will

be different from each other logical descriptions should 
not be too long dr young observes in his paraphrase 
on the book of job that the description of an object is 
complete when you can add nothing but what is common 
to other objects hence we read in that poem of the 
beauty of the peacock the migration of the hawk the 
smftness of the ostrich and the iharpsightedness of the 
eagle these being the main points by which they are 
respectively distinguished 

in descriptive reasoning all the reasoning is in the 
mind there may be no reasoning process manifest in the 
description but though no reasoning is required to prove 
the truth of the description there is still a reasoning process 
going on in the mind it is admitted for example that 
the eye is correctly described the only reasoning in the 
mind is whether this description is a proof of an intelligent 
maker when you have finished your description you have 
proved your proposition for the other part of the argu 
ment that an instrument so constructed must have hsui 
an intelligent maker is a truth of intellect that re 
quires not to be proved by reasoning 

there ore two cases in which descriptions may lead us 
to erroneous condusiona 

the first is when the desmption is incorrect a friend 
who recommends a servant may give an incorrect or at 
least a defective accoimt of his character a party who 
wishes to sell us an estate may give a description that shall 
prepossess us too strongly in its vour or a traveller into 
a foreign coimtry may give a description either of the 
scenery or of the inhabitants that shdl lead us int £dse 
judgments either in regard to the conveniences of the 
country or the character of its inhabitants 

in the second place the description may be correct and 
hence we may too readily embrace the reasoning with 
which it is connected how often have we heard vivid 
and probably correct descriptions of the misery of ireland 
but the accuracy of the description was no proof that the 
specific measure which the sper proposed would relieve 
that miseiy an honourable member may correctly enough 
describe the inconveniences of an existing law but this 
is no proof that the remedy he proposes would remove

misery it is intended to relieva a talent for vivid de

interrogative reasoning 

by interrogative reasoning we mean reasoning by asking 
questions dr young observes in his paraplnase of the 
book of job that an interrogation differs from an ordi 
nary argument as much as telling a man to hang himself 
dififers from a common execution by putting an appro 
priate question you compel the party to pass sentence on 
himsell 

sometimes interrogation is employed for the purpose of 
more emphatic assertion and often gives much adtional 
force to the expression thus king agrippa believest 
thou the prophets i know that thou believest — is more 
forcible than king agrippa i know that thou believest 
the prophets is he the god of the jews only t is 
he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also 
this is more forcible than he is not only the god of the 
jews but also of the gentiles see also jet xlvii 

interrogation ip the proper language of majesty incensed 
see job xxxviii — ezek xviii — it is also 
the language of compassionate reproof hosea xl vi 
it is also the language of wonder and adoration see 
job xl — isaisi xl — it is also the language 
of fervent importunity psalms ixxvii — ixviii

interrogation is sometimes employed as we have inti

mated in the last section to give a more vivid description 
see isaiah iviii — ixiil — matt xl — 

but we are more particularly to observe the use of 
questions u employed in reasoning interrogative reason 
ing is of various kmds 

 the first kind is the socratical form of reasoning 
the following description of it is taken from dr wattss 
 improvement of the mind — 

 the socratical way of disputation— this method 
of dispute derives its name from socrates by whom it was 
practised and by other philosophers in his age long before 
aristotle invented the particular form§ of syllogism in 
mood and figure which are now used in scholastic dispu 
tations the socratical way is managed by questions and 
answers in such a manner as this viz if i would lead a 
person into the belief of a heaven and a hell or a future 
state of rewards and punishments i might begin in some 
such manner of inquiry and suppose the most obvious and 
easiy answers 

 quest does hot god govern the world 

 jns surely he that made it governs it 

 is not grod both a good and righteous governor p 

 a both these characters doubtless belong to him 

 q what is the true notion of a good and righteous governor 

 j that he punishes the wicked and rewards the good 

 q are the good alwap rewarded in this life 

 j no surely for many virtuous men are miserable here 
and greatly afflicted 

 q are the wicked always punished in this life 

 a no certainly for many of them live without sorrow and 
some of the vilest of men are often raised to great riches and 
honour 

 q wherein then doth god make it appear that he is good 
and righteous 

 a i own there is but uttle appearance of it on earth 

 q will there not be a time when the tables shall be turned 
and the scene of things changed since god goyems mankind 
righteously 

 j doubtless there must be a proper time wherein god will 
make that goodness and that righteousness to appear 

 q if this be not before their death how can it be done 



y google 



ikterbooatite reasoninq 

 a i can think of no other way but by supposing man to 
have some existence after this life 

 q are you not convinced then that there must be a state 
of reward and punishment after death p 

 a xes surek i now see plainly that the goodness and 
righteousness of iod as governor of the world necessarily re 
quire it 

 now the adyautages of this method are very con 
siderable — it represents the form of a dialogue or common 
conyersation which is much more easy more pleasant and 
a more sprightly way of instruction and more fit to excite 
the attention and sharpen the penetration of the learner 
than solitary reading or silent attention to a lecture man 
being a sociable creature delights more in conversation 
and learns better this way if it could always be wisely 
and happily practised — this method hath something very 
obliging in it and carries a very humble and condescending 
air when he that instructs seems to be the inquirer and 
seeks information from him who learns — it leads the 
learner into the knowledge of truth as it were by his own 
invention which is a very pleasing thing to human natiire 
and by questions pertinently and artificially proposed it 
does as effectually draw him on to discover his own 
mistakes which he is much more easily persuaded to 
relinquii when he seems to have discovered them himself 
—it is managed in a great measure in the form of the 
most easy reasoning always arising from something asserted 
or known in the foregoing answer and so proceeding to in 
quire something unknown in the following question which 
again makes way for the next answer now such an exer 
cise is very alluring and entertaining to the imderstahding 
while its own ieasoning powers are all along employed 
and that without labour or difficulty because the querist 
finds out and proposes all the intermediate ideas or 
middle terms 

 the second kind of interrogative reasoning is the 
catechetical form 

dr watts intimates that the socratical mode of dispu 
tation might be introduced into catechisms for the in 
struction of children and mrs marcet seems to have

followed this fonn of reasoning in some of her interesting 
 conversations we take the following quotation from 
her willys grammar — 

the following moraing willy came into the schoolroom with 
his erammar in his hand as usual what am i to learn toy 
sir r said he i begin to like my grammar especially now that 
there are stories belonging to it 

 i am very glad to hear it observed mr thompson to 
day you shall learn what an adjective is 

 pray explain it sir for it is a very hard word 

let us see first what the grammar savs about it willy 
and he read — an adjective is a word adaed to a noun to ex 
press its qualitjr as good child a wue man 

 oh hut sir i do not know what to express its quality 
means vou must tell me all about it or i shall never under 
stand it 

 quality replied mr thompson means tu tort of thing 
tell me what sort of a table this is 

 willv after looking at the table a few seconds said it is a 
round table 

• well then round is an adjective because it points out the 
qualily of the table 

 lut it has other qualities sir it is a large table is large 
an adjective too p 

 les every word added to a noun which expresses a quauty 
is an adjective 

 if that is all an adjective is not half so difficult as i thought 
i dare say that i can find out some more adjectives for the table 
let me think a little it is a wooden table so wooden must be 
an adjective then it is a pretty table and pretfv must also be an 
adjective besides it is an old table for it has been in the room 
i believe before i was bom i cant think of any more adjec 
tives for the table said willy and starting up suddenly to look 
at a bird that flew across the window he uset an inkstand which 
stood upon the table at first he was frightened thinking he 
had broken it but finding he had only spilled some of the ink 
he said oh sir it is omy another adjective for the table for 
now added he it is a dirtv table then taking a piece of 
blottingpaper he soaked up the ink and wiping the table care 
fully said and now it is a clean table 

you have gained two adjectives for the table said mr 
thompson and one for yourself 

 one for me sir p what is that p 

 do not you think that you are an awjctcard child to have 
overset the inkstand p 

 yes but then am a tidy one for having wiped the table

clean so there is another adjective for me but sir this other 
table has different adiectives for it is sfuare and small not round 
and largey like the other mr marcet 

catechisms as they are generally constructed are not 
pieces of interrogative reasoning the question merely 
asks for information what is supplied by the answer they 
do not therefore come under our present notice i may 
observe that in the catechisms of the wesleyan methodists 
the answer to each question is put in the form of a complete 
proposition embodying the entire sense of both the question 
and the answer thus how many sacraments hatjh christ 
ordained in his church christ hath ordained two sacra 
ments in his church baptism and the lords supper 

 sometimes we ask questions in order to answer them 
with the view of removing from the discussion the topics 
to which they refer or to increase the force of our 
expression 

thus a writer on agricultural distress commences with 
questions in the form of inquiries to which he replies — 

 there is no denial and there can be no doubt that the whole 
agriculture of england is menaced at this moment with ruin

barrenness — the late harvest has been remarkably productive 
has the land been trampled by insurrection — itlias exhibited a

 the relation of cause and effect is often intimated by 
interrogations when a wrong cause as we think has been 
assigned for an effect and we desire to intimate the true 
cause we can do this by asking questions 

 one man pines under a broken constitution but let us ask 
him whether he can fairly and honestly assign no cause for this 
but the unknown decree of heaven has he duly yalued the 
blessing of health and always observed the roles of virtue and 
sobriety has he been moderate in his hfe and temperate in all 
his pleasures if now he is only paying the price of his former 
perhaps his forgotten indulgences has he any title to complain as 
if he were suffering unjustly p but you perhaps complain of 
hardships of another kind— of the injustice of the world of the 
poverty which you suffer and the discouragements under which 
you labour of the crosses and disappointments of which your 
life has been doomed to be full before you give too much scope 
to your discontent let me desire you to reflect impartially upon 
your past train of life has not sloth or pride or ill temper or 
sinful passions misled you often from the path of sound and wise 
conduct p have you not been wanting to yourselves in improv 
ing those opportunities which providence offered you for better 
ing and advancing your state if you have chosen to indulge 
your humour or your taste in the gratification of indolence or 
pleasure can you complain because others in preference to you 
nave obtained those advantages which naturally belong to useful 
labours and honourable pursuits p have not the consequences of 
lome fajse steps into which your passions or your pleasures have 
betrayed you pursued you through much of your life tainted 
perhaps your characters involved you in embarrassments or 
sunk you into neglect p — anon

the words onus prohandi mean the burden of proving 
it may be useful to notice the cases in which this burden 
may rightfully fall upon you in all cases when you attack 
a generally received opinion you are bound to prove the 
unsoundness of that opinion sentiments which are uni 
versally acknowledged to be true are seldom very minutely 
examined there is no object in inquiring into the ground 
of a doctrine that no one ever denies if you think any 
opinion of this kind is erroneous you have a right u 
ass£dl it but you have no right to single out at a moment 
warning any professed believer in that doctrine and demand 
from him a reason for his creed if you wish for contror 
versy you are bound to lead the attack if you cannot 
do this you had better hold your tongue 

if you advocate any kind of political or social refonn 
the onus probandi falls upon you you are bound to shov 
the advantages of the change tou have no right in the 
first instance to call upon your opponent to show that tte 
proposed change would not be advantageous every nesr 
act of parliament is a change and every member who 
brings forward a new biu is bound to show the advantages 
that would result from the adoption of the measures thit 
he recommends 

if you offer a bill to your banker for discount the onus

if you cannot do this he will be justified in refiiangto dw 
count it you have no right to call upon him to prove that 
it is not a good one so if you give a bad character to any

you have no right to call upon him to disprove the charge 
and to assume it to be true if he cannot do so the onus

generally speaking the onus prohandi fells upon the 
advocate of the affirmative of any proposition no man 
should be called upon to prove a negative in practical 
questions however it is not always easy to state which side 
is properly the affirmative as much will depend upon the

improve your knowledge daily by merely observing the 
conversation of your friends you will find examples of 
conversational reasoning in the fifteenth chapter of the 
first book of samuel and in the eighth chapter of the 
gospel according to st john 

 the language and form of conversational reasoning 

this is chiefly by enthymemes i wish i had a good 
english word to substitute for the greek word enthytneme 
 — it signifies ram the mind reasoning by enthymemes 
therefore means reasoning from the mind — reasoning as 
you think or talk or write in the ordinary afltos of life 
you have heard of a character in a french play who was 
surprised to learn that he had been talking prose for fi 
years without knowing it he might have made the same 
observation respecting enthymemes whenever you have 
given a reason you have spoken an enthymeme if you 
observe to a friend it is a fine day that is a description 
k you ask is it going to be wet that is an interroga 
tion if you say i shall take my umbrella for i think 
it will rain that is an enthymeme 

enthymemes are treated of largely in aristotles rhe 
toric the following is the substance of his doctrine 
respecting them an enthymeme bears the same relation 
to rhetoric as a syllogism to logic it is composed of a 
sentence and a reason a sentence is a gener proposi 
tion concerning those things which are to be desired or 
avoided and it bears the same relaticm to an enthymeme 
as any proposition to a syllogism and therefore a sen 
t€ice if a reason he rendered becomes a conclusion and 
both together me an enthymeme the following is an 
example given by aristotle to be overlearned produces 
efieminacy and envy therefore he that is wise will not 
suflfer his children to be overlearned the form of this 
enthymeme may be reversed thus — a wise man will not 
suflfer his chilfren to be overlearned because too much 
learning produces eflfeminacy and envy

examination in the oxford schools has thus treated of 
enthymemes r— 

 the enthymeme is a defective syllogism which consists of 
one premiss and a condusion eg 

 diamcmds are jewels thev are therefore valuable 

 god is a spirit therefore ne is eternal 
 an enthymeme may easily be reduced to a regular syllogistic 
form for siace the conclusion and one premiss are given the 
three terms may be known and the omitted premiss may be sup 
plied thus in the above example the major all jewels are 
valuable is omitted and if supplied the syllogism will be 
regular thus t 

 all jewels e valuable 

 diamonds are jewels 
thetorey diamonds are valuable 

again 

 every spirit is eternal 
god is a spirit 

therorey god is eternal 

in both these examples the major premiss is suppressed for 
as was before observed the major premiss is generally speakmg 
some universal and incontrovertible principle which is so evident 
that it is left to the hearers judgment but the minor premiss is 
most commonly expressed because it has more particular refer 
ence to the question which is to be proved 

 in common discourse the usual mode of expressing an argument 
is hy means of the enthymeme it being unnecessary to adduce both 
the premises when one is so evident that it may very fairly be left 
to the hearts judgment eg 

 when we find a book quoted or referred to by an ancient 
author we are entitled to conclude that it was read and received 
in the age and country in which that author lived this sen 
tence is an enthymeme in which the major premiss is suppressed 
bnt which may easily be supplied as follows every book quoted 
or referred to by an ancient author must have been read and re 
ceived in the age and country in which that author lived the 
sentence may thus be reduced to a regular svuogism in barbara 
this may be effected in most enthymemes without much diflficulty 
whether their conclusions be negative or affirmative 

 although the migor premiss is generally suppressed in most 
enthymemes yet there are some enthymemes in which the minor 
premiss is found to be omitted this may happen when the minor 
premiss is very evident or when much stress is meant to be laid

is united in one proposition with the conclusion e all

 the power of ridicule is a dangerous faculty since it tempts

you will observe that although an euthymeme is called 
by scholastio logicians a defective syllogism yet the syllo 
gism is formed from the enthymeme not the euthymeme 
from the syllogism the euthymeme is the natural 
mode of reasoning the syllogism is the artificial mode 
the argument first occurs to our mind in the form of an 
enthymeme but when we wish to make it clearer we 
exteid it to a syllogism 

you will remember that the occurrence of or he 
cavscy hherefore or any similar word either in conver 
sjition or in reading usually denotes an enthymeme in 
other words denotes a reason or argument expressed natu 
rally without the formality of scholastic logic 

in the refutation of enthymemes we sometimes reply to 
the implied proposition for example if the enthymeme 
be — you ought to do this because the clergyman bids 
you j the reply may be — and ought i do everything which 
the clergyman bids me of this kind is the scriptural 
example why do thy disciples transgress the tradition 
of the elders for they wash not their hands when they 
eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do 
ye transgress the commandment of god by your tradi 
tion — mattxv at other times we admit the im 
plied proposition of the enthymeme and object only to 
the proposition which is expressed thus in reply to — 
you had better take your umbrella for it is going to 
rain you may say — no i dont think it will rain 
the implied proposition that when it is going to rain 
you should take your umbrella is not disjuted

any pleasant passing and goodhumoured jest will free you

even as an easy playful oissent from objectionable opinions will 
relieve you from the necessity of disputing or submitting to them

anecdotes are pretty ffems in conversation and famish admir 
able illustrations they so serve to fill up a threatening pause

appropriate short well timed and well told but let no one

lection of anecdotes for however numerous they wiu necessarily 
wear out and they never admit of being repeated

essential portion of the dish itself still a good relater of anec

beasonino bt single stllogism 

section iv 

keasoning bt single syllogism 

the following description of the nature of the syllogism 
is taken from dr watts — 

 if the mere perception and comparison of two ideas 
would always show us whether they agree or disagree then 
all rational propositions would be matters of intelligence 
or first principles and there would be no use of reasoning 
or drawing any consequences it is the narrowness of the 
human mind which introduces the necessity of reasoning 
when we are unable to judge of the truth or felsehood of 
a proposition in an immediate manner by the mere con 
templation of its subject and predicate we are then con 
strained to use a medium and to compare each of them 
with some third idea that by seeing how far they agree or 
disagree with it we may be able to judge how far they 
agree or disagree among themselves as if there are two 
lines a and b and i know not whether they are equal or 
no i take st third line o or an inch and apply it to each 
of them if it agree with them both then i infer that a 
and b are equal but if it agree with one and not with the 
other then i conclude a and b are unequal if it agree 
with neither of them there can be no comparison 

 so if the question be whether god must be worshipped 
we seek a third idea suppose the idea of a creator and say 

 our creator must be worshipped 
god is our creator 
therefore god must be worshipped 

 the comparison of this third idea with the two dis 
tinct parts of the questions usually requires two proposi 
tions which are called the premises the third proposition 
which is drawn from them is the conclusion 

 thus it appears what is the strict and just notion of a 
syllogism it is a sentence or argument mads up of three 
proposuionsf so disposed as that the last is necessarily 
inferred from those which go before as in the instances 
which have been just mentioned 

 digitized by cjooq ic 



 logic fob the milliok 

 the three terms are named the major the minor and 
the middle the predicate of the conclusion is called the 
major term because it is generally of a larger extensiou 
than the minor term or the subject the major and minor 
terms are called the extremes the middle term is the 
third idea inyented and disposed in two propositions in 
such a manner as to show the connexion between the major 
and minor term in the conclusion for which reajson the 
middle term itself is sometimes called the argument 

 that proposition which contains the predicate of the 
conclusiotij connected with the middle term is usually called 
the major proposition whereas the minor proposition con 
nects the middle term with the subject of the conclusion 
and is sometimes caued the assumption 

• this exact distinction of the several parts of a syllo 
gism and of the major and minor terms connected with the 
middle term in the msyor and minor propositions does 
chiefly belong to simple or categorical syllogisms though 
all syllogisms whatsoever have something analogical to it 

 single syllogisms are made up of diree propositions 
compound syllogisms contain more than three propositions 
and may be formed into two or more syllcsms 

 single syllogisms for distinctions sake may be divided 
into simple complex and conjunctive 

i — simple syllogism 

 those are properly called simple or categorical syllo 
gisms which are made up of three plain single or cate 
gorical propositions wherein the middle term is evidently 
and regularly joined with one part of the question in the 
major proposition and with the other in the minor 
whence there flows a plain single conclusion as v every 
human virtue is to be sought with diligence prudence 
is a human virtue therefore prudence is to be sout 
with diligence 

ii — complex syllogism 

those are properly called complex syllogisms in which 
the middle term is not connected with the whole subject 
or the whole predicate in two distinct propositions but ia

eeasoning by single syllogisms 

intermingled aiid compared with them by parts or in a more 
confused manner in diflferent forms of speech as — 

 the sun is a senseless being 
the persians worshipped the sun 
therefore the persians worshipped a senseless being 

here the predicate of the conclusion is worshipped a 
senseless being part of which is joined with the middle 
term sun in the major proposition and the other part 
in the minor 

 though this sort of argument is confessed to be en 
tangled or confused and irregular if examined by the 
rules of simple syllogisms yet there is a great variety of 
arguments used in books of learning and in common life 
whose consequence is strong and evident and which must 
be ranked imder this head as — 

 pious men are the only favourites of heaven true christians 
are favourites of heaven therefore true christians are pious 
men or thus hypjocrites are not pious men therefore hypo 
crites are not favourites of heaven 

 none but physicians came to the consultation the nurse is 
no physician therefore the nurse came not to the consultation 

 the fogs vanish as the sun rises but the fogs have not yet 
begun to vanish therefore the sun is not yet risen 

it is necessary that a general understand the art of war but 
caius does not understand the art of war therefore it is neces 
sary caius should not be a general a total eclipse of the sun 
would cause daikness at noon it is possible that the moon at 
that time may totally eclipse the sun therefore it is possible 
that the moon may cause darkness at noon 

 now the force of all these arguments is so evident 
and concltisive that though the form of the syllogism be 
never so irregidar yet we are sure the inferences are just 
and true for the premises according to the reason of 
things do really contain the conclusion that is deduced 
from them which is a neverfeiling test of a true syuo 



iii — conjuncnvb syllogism 

 those are called conjunctive syllogisms wherein one of 
the premises namely the major has distinct parts which 
are joined by a conjunction or some such particle of

 logic fob the million 

speech most times the major or minor or both are 
explicitly compound propositions and generally the major 
proposition is made up of two distinct parts or proposi 
tions in such a manner as that by the assertion of one in 
the minor the other is either asserted or denied in the 
conclusion or by the denial of one in the minor the 
other is either asserted or denied in the conclusion it 
is hardly possible indeed to fit any short definition to 
include all the kinds of them but the chief amongst them 
are the conditional syllogism the diigunctive the relcuive 
and the connexive 

 the conditional or hypothetical syllogism is that 
whose major or minor or both are conditional proposi 
tions as if there be a god the world is governed by 
providence but there is a god therefore the world is 
governed by providence 

these syllogisms admit two sorts of true argumentation 
where the major is conditional pirst when the antecedent is 
asserted in the minor that tlie consequent may he asserted in the 
conclusion such is the preceding example this is called 
arguing from the position of the antecedent to the position of 
the consecjuent secondly when the consequent is contradicted 
in the minor proposition that the antecedent may he contra 
dicted in the conclusion as if atheists are in the right then 
the world exists without a cause hut the world does not exist 
without a cause therefore atheists are not in the right this 
is called arguing from the removing of the consequent to the 
removing of the antecedent 
 

 a disjunctive syllogism is when the major propo 
sition is disjunctive as the earth moves in a circle or an 
ellipsis but it does not move in a circle therefore it 
moves in an ellipsis 

 a disjunctive syllogism may have many members or parts 
thus it is either spring summer autumn or winter but it is 
ntft spring autumn or winter therefore it is summer 

 a relative syllogism requires the major proposition 
to be relative as where christ is there shall his servants 
be but christ is in heaven therefore his servants shall 
be there also or as is the captain so are his soldiers 
but the captain a coward therefore his soldiers are 
 too

• arffuments that relate to the doctrine of proportion must be 
referred to this head as as two are to four so are three to six 
but two make the half of four therefore three make the half 
of six 

 a connexive syllogism requires that two or more 
ideas be so connected either in the complex subject or 
predicate of the major that if one of them be afirmed or 
denied in the minor common sense will naturally show us 
what will be the consequence 

meekness and humility aljnrays go together moses was a 
man of meekness therefore moses was also humble or we 
may form this minor pharaoh was no humble man therefore he 
was not meek 

no man can serve grod and mammon the covetous man 
serves mammon therefore he cannot serve god or the minor

not serve manunon — watts s logic 

academic or scholastic disputation which was carried on 
by llogism is thus described in dr wattss improve 
ment of the mind — 

 the common methods in which disputes are managed in the 
schools of learning are these viz 

 the tutor appoints a question in some of the sciences to 
be debated amongst his students one of them imdertakes to 
affirm or to deny the question and to defend his assertion or 
negation and to answer all objections against it he is called the 
respondent and the rest of the students in the same class or 
who pursue the same science are the opponents who are ap 
pointed to dispute or raise objections against the proposition 
thus affirmed or denied 

 each of the students successively in their turn becomes 
the respondent or the defender of that proposition while the rest 
oppose it also successively in their turns 

 it is the business of the respondent to write a thesis in 
latin or short discourse on the question proposed and he either 
affirms or denies the question according to the opinion of the 
tutor which is supposed to be the truth and he reads it at the 
biiiiing of the dispute 

 in his discourse which is written with as great accuracy 
as the youth is capable ot he explains the terms of the question 
frees them from all ambiguity fijtes their sense dechtres the true 
intent and meaning of the question itself separates it from other 
questions with which it may have been complicated and distin 
guishes it from other questions which may happen to be akin to

it and then pronounces in the negative or affirmatiye concern 
ing it 

 when this is done then in the second part of his dis 
course he gives his own strongest arguments to confirm the pro 
position he has laid down i e to vindicate his own side of the 
question but he does not usually proceed to represent the objec 
tions against it and to solve or answer them for it is the busi 
ness of the other students to raise objections in disputing 

 when the respondent has read over his thesis in the 
school the junior studenf makes an objection and draws it up in 
the regular form of a syllogism the respondent repeats the 
objection and either denies the major or minor proposition 
directly or he distinguishes upon some word or phrase in the 
major or minor and shows in what sense the proposition may be 
true but that that sense does not affect the question and then 
declares that in the sense in which it affects the present cuestion 
the proposition is not true and consequently he denies it 

 then the opponent proceeds by another syllogism to vindi 
cate the proposition that is denied again the respondent answers 
by denying or distinguishing 

thus the disputation goes on in a series or succession of 
syllogisms and answers till the objector is silenced and has no 
more to say 

 when he can go no further the next student begins to 
propose his objection and then the third and the fourth even to 
the senior who is the last opponent 

 during this time the tutor sits in the chair as president 
or moderator to see that the rules of disputation and decency be 
observed on both sides and to admonisn each disputant of any 
irregularity in their conduct his work is also to illustrate and 
explain the answer or distinction of the respondent where it is 
obscure to strengthen it where it is weak and to correct it where 
it is false and when the respondent is pinched with a strong 
objection and is at a loss for an answer the moderator assists 
him and suggests some answer to the objection of the opponent 
in defence of the question according to his own opinin or 
sentiment 

the advantages and disadvantages of this method of dis 
putation are thus pointed out — 

it must be confessed there are some advantages to be 
attained by academical disputation it gives vigour ana briskness 
to the mind thus exercised and relieves the langour of private 
study and meditation it sharpens the wit and all the inventive 
powers it makes the thoughts active and sends them on all 
sides to find arguments and answers both for opposition and de 
fence it gives opportunity of viewing thesubjeijt of discourse

beasoning bt single syllogism 

on all sides and of learning what inconveniences difficulties and 
objections attend particular opinions it furnishes the soul with 
various occasions of starting such thoughts as otherwise would 
never have come into the mind it maes a student more ex 
pert in attacking and refuting an error as well as in vindicating a 
truth it instructs the scholar in the various methods of wardmg 
off the form of objections and of discovering and repelling the 
subtile tricks of sophisters it procures also a freedom and readi 
ness of speech and raises the modest and diffident genius to a 
due degree of courage 

but there are some very grievous inconveniences that may 
sometimes overbalance all these advantages for many youi 
students by a constant habit of disputing grow impudent and 
audacious proud and disdainful talkative and impertinent and 
render themselves intolerable by an obstinate humour of main 
taining whatever they have asserted as well as by a spirit of 
contradiction opposing almost everything that thej hear the 
disputation itself often awakens the passions of ambition emula 
ticm and anger it ciyrries away the mind from that calm and 
sedate temper which is so necessary to contemplate truth 

 it is evident also that by frequent exercises of this sort 
wherein opinions true and false are argued supjorted and refuted 
on both sides the mind of man is led by insensible degrees to an 
uncertain and fluctuating temper and falls into danger of a scep 
tical humour which never comes to an establishment in any 
doctrines many persons by this means become much more 
ready to oppose whatsoever is offered in searching out truth they 
harcuy wait till they have read or heard the sentiment of any 
person before their heads are busily employed to seek out argu 
ments against it they grow naturally sharp in finding out 
difficulties and by indulging this humour they converse with 
the dark and doubtful parts of a subject so long till they almost 
render themselves incapable of receiving the ftdl evidence of a 
prodosition and acknowledging the light of truth it has some 
tenaency to make a youth a carping critic rather than a judi 
cious man 

we presume that disputes of this kind were carried on 
at oxford in the time of mr john wesley 

eight months after his election to a fellowship he was ap 
pointed greek lecturer and moderator of the classes at that 
time disputationswere held six times aweek at lincoln college

lord baoon observed in his novum organum published 
in the year that the logic now in use is not con 
ducible to the finding out of true science but tends to 
the establishment and confirmation of errours which are 
founded in vulgar notions rather than to a serious inquiry 
aftertruth 

 a syllogisme he states is not used among the prin 
ciples of sciences and in medial axioms it is employed in 
vain for it falls muph short of natures subtilty it con 
sists of propositions propositions of words words interpret 
notions therefore if notions the basis of things be con 
fused and rashly abstracted from things nothing will be 
firm that is built upon them therefore our only assurance 
is in a right induction 

the port royal logic was published at paris by the 
jansenists in the year the authors seem to have 
had no very high opinion of the aristotelian forms of logic 
they refer to certain matters difficult enough but of little 
use such as the conversion of propositions and the demon 
stration of the rules of figure and they express a doubt 
of the usefulness of the syllogism saying that the greater 
part of the errors of men arise much moie from their rea 
soning on false principles than from their reasoning wrongly 
on their principles 

mr hallam observes in his literature of europe 
that after the publication of the port royal logic it 
became more and more acknowledged that the rules of 
syllogism go a vei little way in rendering the mind able 
to follow a course of inquiry without error much less in 
assisting it to discover truth and that even their vaxmted 
prerogative of securing us from fidlacy is nearly inefiectual 
in exercise

byllogism and then it comes too late to settle the matter 
it is of no assistance to reasonings as it is more difficult to 
imderstand the rules of syllogism than it is to understand

db watts throughout his work has strongly enforced 
the doctrine that an acquaintance with the things them 
selves is the only way of reasoning correctly about them 
and he exhorts lus readers not to rely upon ihe mere forms 
of scholastic logic 

he thus sps of formal definitions — 

after all it must ae confessed that many logicians and philo 
sophers in former ages have made too greiit a hustle about the 
exactness of their definition of things and entered into long 
froitless controversies and very ridiculous debates in the several 
sciences about adjusting the logical formalities of every defini 
tion whereas that sort of wrangling is now grown very justly 
contemptible since it is agreed that true learmng and the know 
kdffe of thii depends much more upon a large acquaintance 
with their vanous properties causes effects subject object ends 
and designs than it does upon the formal and scholastic niceties 
of genus and difference — watts s logic 

in the section on the opposition and conversion of pro 
positions he observes 

 the logicians of the schools have vmtten many large trifles 
concerning the opposition and conversion of propositions it will 
be sufficient here to give a few brief hints of tnese things that 
the learner may not be utterly ignorant of them — ibid 

the following are his remarks on the moods and figures 
of simple syllogisms — 

 shnple syllogisms are adorned and surrounded in the common 
books of logic with a variety of inventions about moods and 
figures wherein by the artificial contexture of the letters a e i 
and o men have endeavoured to transform logic or the art of 
beasonidg into a sort of mechanism and to teach boys to syllo 
gise or fiame arguments and refute them ioithout any real in

taught perhaps in their trifling years to compose latin versc 
that is oy certain tables and squares with a variety of letters in 
them wherein by counting every sixth seventh or eighth letter 
certain latin words should be muned in the form of hexameters 
or pentameters and this may be done by those who know nothing 
of latin or of verses 

 i confess some of these logical subtleties have much more 
use than those versifying tables and there is much ingenuity 
discovered in determining the precise number of syllogisms that 
may be formed in every ure and giving the reasons of them 
yet the light of nature a good judgment and due consideration 
of things tend more to true reasoning than all the trappings of 
moods and ures — ibid 

dr campbell published his rhetoric in the year 
he strongly condemns the syllogistic mode of reasoning 
as nnnatiiral and prolix its rules are cumbersome to the 
memory and unnecessary in practice this method of 
arguing has not the least affinity to moral reasoning in 
matters that we know by experience it can be of little or 
no utility and it has produced two evils — a desire of 
disputing on every subject however incontrovertible and 
a philosophical pride which will not permit us to believe 
anything even a selfevident principle without a previous 
reason or argument 

from the time of the publication of dr wattss logics 
the scholastic forms of reasoning appear to have fallen into 
disuse dr whatblt the present archbishop of dublin 
was the means of reviving attention to the subject in the 
university of oxford he was at that time the principal 
of st albans hall his publication on the subject first 
appeared in the encyclopaedia metropolitana and was 
afterwards published separately not only were the scho 
lastic forms resumed but new definitions of logic were 
brought forward and they who had stated in their works 
any theory inconsistent with these definitions were charged 
with being ignorant of the nature of the science dr watts 
is repeatedly censured for calling logic the art of using our 
reason well and we are told that logic is the art of 
employing language properly for the purpose of reasoning

merely to see that the conclusion follows naturally from 
those propositions supposing them to be true and this 
point is to be ascertained not by the exercise of the judgment 
but by the application of certain rules which scholastic 
logicians have frawn up for this purpose to perceive the 
force of a syllogistic argument it is not necessary to be 
acquainted with the subject nor even in some cases to 
understancl the meaning of the words 

sir william hamilton a professor of logic and meta 
physics in the university of edinburgh has proposed what 
he deems an improvement in the syllogistic mode of reason 
ing by the adoption of what he cgjls the quantification of 
the predicate by this phrase he means nothing more than 
that the word all or some should be attached to the 
predicate of the propositions that enter into the syllogism 
thus instead of saying all men are mortal he would 
say all men are some mortal to denote that other 
beings are mortal besides men a book has been published 
on this subject by mr thomas spencer baynes under the 
sanction and approval of sir william hamilton entitled 
 an essay on the new analytic of logical forms it 
is difficult to perceive what great practical advantage 
would be gained by this suestion even were it uni 
versally adopted the arguments in favour of its adoption 
rest mainly on the defects of the present system mr 
baynes states that logic has remained imperfect and de 
formed in the hands of all previous logicians and that in 
regard to the common doctrine of syuogistic figure mood 
and reduction the whole doctrine is cumbrous and unsatis 
ctorjr inconsistent and destructive of the science itself 
mr jynes from the extent of his logical reading should 
be a very competent witness on this subject he has shown 
we think that the rules of scholastic logic contain some 
great inconsistencies it is remarkable how ready scholastic 
logicians are to censure their own system as explained by 
other writers archbishop whately accuses i know not 
how many preceding authors of being totally ignorant 
of the nature of logic and mr baynes considers the 
whole science to have been imperfect from the days of

mr mill steers a middle course with rard to the syllo 
gism he says — archbishop whately has contended that 
eyllogizing or reasoning from generals to particulars is not 
agreeably to the vtdgar idea a peculiar mode of reasoning 
but the philosophical analysis of the mode in which all 
men reason and must do so if they reason at all with 
the deference due to so high an authority i cannot help 
thinking that the vulgar notion is in this case the more 
correct in the syllogism all men are mortal the 
duke of wellington is a man therefore the duke of wel 
lington is mortal — mr mill thinks that we do not infer 
the mortality of the duke of wellington from the general 
proposition all men are mortal but from our experience 
of john thomas c who once were in being but are now 
dead he contends that all inference is from particulars 
to particulars and that general propositions are merely 
registers of such inferences dr wbewell thinks that this 
doctrine of mr mill that the force of the eiyllogism con 
sists in an inductive assertion with an interpretation added 
to ity solves very happily the difficulties which baffle the 
other theories of this subject this question is rather 
beyond the limits we have assigned to our own inquiries 
but it appears to us that if the individual conclusion is not 
a deduction from the general principle the argument is no 
longer a syllogism it may nevertiieless be a good mode 
of reasoning but surely it is not a syllogism in the sense 
in which archbishop whately and other logical writers use 
the term at the same time it appears to put the syllogism 
in the same place that we have assigned to it in the pre 
sent work it is received as one of the forms of reasoning 
in some cases a very usem form but not necessarily con 
nected more than any otber form with the reasoning pro

cera and whether mr mill gets his conclusion from the 
general proposition or from certain fects of which the gene 
ral proposition is a correct register does not appear to be 
of much practical importance 

after a consideration of all the above writers and of 
others whom we have consulted on the subject we have 
arrived at the conclusion that the syllogism is only one of 
the forms of reasoning a useftd form certainly in some 
cases but still only a form and by no means necessarily 
connected with any of the principles of reasoning 

it has been said that all other modes of reasoning may 
be turned into syllogisms it would be difficult to prove 
this but it is not worth while to ask for proof let it be 
admitted that all other forms of reasoning may be turned 
into syllogisms and that all syllogisms may be turned into 
other forms of reasoning this convertibility shows that 
syllogism is only one of the forms in which all reasons 
may be expressed another argimient to prove that it is 
only a form is that the mass of mankind reason well and 
yet know nothing about it none of the writers of the old 
testament knew anything about syllogism nor have we any 
proof that it was known to the writers of the new we are 
not aware that it has ever been known to the chinese or 
to any other people unacquainted with greek we are 
sure that the mass of the population in our own country 
are wholly tmacquainted with it 

seeing then that syllogism is one of the forms of reason 
ing it may be well to inquire for what kinds of reasoning 
it is best adapted 

it does not appear to be well adapted for arguments 
founded on induction or on analogy or on mere proba 
bility the conclusion of a syllogism should be a certainty 
and a certain deducticm from the premises let us take 
mr mills example — 

ah men are mortal 
the duke of wellington is a man 
therefore the bake of wellington is mortal 

here you will observe it is essential to the validity of 
this argument that the first proposition should be univer 
sally true had it been said all men except one are 
n

 logic fob thb xilliok 

mortal the duke of wellington is a man we could not 
have inferred that the duke of wellington is mortal for 
that excepted one might for ought we know be the duke 
of wellington 

it would appear from thia example that the syllogism 
is not adapted for probable arguments however high the 
dree of probabihty may be hence as in the moral 
sciences and in the ordinary affairs of life we cannot 
always have more than a high degree of probability it 
seems to follow that in these sciences and in these afirs 
we cannot always employ the syllogism 

the chief principle of reasoning for which the syllogism 
appears to be adapted is that of genus and species and here 
chiefly when the relation of genus and species is founded 
 in nature when we try to form this relation mentally by 
simply changing the mode of expression we may weaken 
our reasoning we have shown this at page in similar 
cases we can rarely form a major proposition capable of 
being proved to be universally true we place ourselves 
by syllogism under the necessity of proving a universal 
when the argument requires us to prove only a particular 
and we attempt to prove by reasoning a proposition that 
cannot be proved but by observation and experience 

although an argument legitimately founded on any other 
relation than genus and species such as the relation of 
subject and attribute cause and effect can seldom be so 
well expressed by syllogism yet when an argument is 
intimately founded on the relation of genus and species 
and that a natural not an artificial relation the syllogism 
will sometimes afford the means of expressing the argu 
ment with superior clearness perhaps this is the case in 
the example we have noticed were we to say as the 
duke of wellington is a man he must be mortal or 
 as all men are mortal the duke of welhngton must be 
mortal for he is only a man or any similar mode of 
expression we should not perchance express our meaning 
with as much clearness as in the above syllogism 

while we are thus ready to admit that the syllogism is 
sometimes a useful form of reasoning we do not admit that 
an argument derives greater strength from being put into 
this form in fact no argument obtains increased strength

by being expressed in one form more than in another the 
advantage gained is in point of clearness or in adaptation 
to the party to whom the argument may be addressed 
the same form is not suitable for all occasions the form 
which gives clearness and adaptation in one case may in 
another case be attended with obscurily and unsuitableness 
the case in which syllogism may be used with advantage 
is as we have said in natural relations of genus and species 
in many other cases we think it unsuitable and in some 
probably injurious 



section v 

reasoning by compound syllogism 

 we properly call those compound syllogisms which are 
made of two or more single syllogisms and may be resolved 
into them the chief kinds are these epichirema dilemma 
prosyllcsmus and sorites 

 i epichirema is a syllogism which contains the proof 
of the major or minor or both before it diaws the con 
clusion 

 this is often used in writing in public speeches and in com 
mon conversation that so each part of the discourse may be 
confirmed and put out of doubt as it moves on toward the con 
clusion which was cluefly designed take this instance 

 sickness may be good for us for it weans us from the 
pleasures of life and makes us think of dyin 

but we are omeasy xmder sickness which appears by our 
impatience complaints groanings c 

 therefore we are uneasy sometimes under that which is good 
for us 

another instance you may see in ciceros oration in defence 
of milo who had slain clodius his major proposition is that 
it is lawful for one man to kill another who lies in wait to kill 

 with reference to the system of scholastic logic mr bailey observes — 
 such an artificial system is needless because the natural method is ready of 
application and sufficient of itself it does not substitute compendious processes 
for long ones nor such as are easy for such as are difficult nor those which are 
more certain for those which are less to be relied upon and it has not the 
slightest pretensions to the power of conducting us to results which we could not 
reach without its assistance while on the other hand the study of it requires a 
great expenditure of time and labour and is attended from its very nature with 
intellectual evils of no inconsiderable moment— page

anity examples c his minor is that ciodius laid wait for 
ilo which he proves hy his arms guards c and then in 
fers uie condosbn that it was lawful for wlo to kill ciodius 

 ii a dilemmk is an argument which divides the whole 
into all its parts or members by a disjunctive proposition 
and then infers something concerning each part which is 
finally inferred oonceming the whole 

 instances of this are frequent as in this life we must either 
ohey our vicious inclinations or resist them to obey them will 
bring sin and sorrow to resist them is laborious and painful 
therefore we cannot be perfectly free from sorrow or pain in 
this life 

 a dilemma becomes faulty or ineffectual three ways first 
when the members of the division are not well opposed or not 
fully enumerated for then the major is false secondlv when 
what is asserted concerning each part is not just for then the 
minor is not true thirdly when it may be retorted with equal 
force upon him who utters it 

 there was a famous ancient instance of this case wherein 
a dilemma was retorted euathlus promised protagoras a reward 
when he bad taught him the art of pleading ana it was to be 
paid the first daj that he gained any cause m the court after 
a considerable time protagoras goes to law with euathlus for the 
reward and uses this dilemma either the cause wiu go on my 
side or on yours if the cause goes on my side you must pay 
me according to the sentence of the judge if the cause goes on 
your side you must pay me according to your bargain therefore 
whether the cause goes for me or against me you must pay me 
the reward but euathlus retorted this dilemma thus either 
i shall gain the cause or lose it if i gain the cause en 
nothing will be due to you accordmg to the sentence of the 
judffe but if i lose the cause nothing will be due to you ac 
oorain to my bargain therefore whether i lose or gain the 
cause i will not pay you for nothing will be due tojou 

 this sort of argument may be composed of three or more 
members and may be called a trilemma 

 iii a prosyllogism is when two or more syllogisms 
are so connected together that the conclusion of the former 
is the major or the minor of the following 

example — 

blood cannot think hut the soul of man thinks therefore 
the soul of man is not blood but the soul of a brute is his blood

rbakik bt compound tllogim 

acootdkg to the scripture therefore the soul of man is different 
from the sonl of a brute 

 ly a sorites is when several middle terms are chosen 
to connect one another successively in several propositions 
till the last proposition connects its predicate with the first 
subject 

 thus all men of revenge have their souls often uneasy un 
easv souls are a plague to themselves now to be ones own plague 
is folly in the extre therefore all men of revenge are extreme 
fools the apostle bom viii gives us an itance of this 
sort of argument if it were reduced to exact form whom he 
foreknew those he predestinated whom he predestinated he 
called whom he called he justified whom he lustified he glori 
fied therefore whom he foreknew he glorified 

 to these syllogisms it may not be improper to add 
induction which is when from several particular proposi 
tions we infer one general as the doctrine of the soci 
nians caimot be proved from the gospels it cannot be 
proved from the acta of the apostles it cannot be proved 
from the epistles nor the book of revelation therefore 
it cannot be proved fixm the new testament — watts 
logic 

we shall here give an example of each of these compound 
syllogisms — 

i — the epichireiia 

happiness is the result of certain habits 
man has the power of acquiring those habits 
therefore man has the power of making himself happy 

the first and second of these propositions require to be 
separately proved here is the proof — 

 happiness is the result of certain habits 

we find ourselves making a part of an existing universe 
which neither ignorance nor wisdom doubting nor confidence 
can alter if we know the order of which we are the subjects 
and conform to it toe are hap 

the natural laws of this system are xiniversal invariable

over our world and we have every reason to believe over all

other worlds wherever moral beings keep in horwumy with thet 
laws there is no instance in which happiness is not the result men 
never enjoy health vigoor and felicity in disobedience to them 
the whole infinite contrivance of everythinff aboye around and 
within us appears directed to certain benevolent issues and all 
the laws of nature are in perfect harmony with the whole consti 
tution of men 

in all positions man finds himself called upon by the dear 
indications of the organic laws to take that nree and cheerful 
exercise which is calculated to develope vigorous muscular and 
nervous and mental action the peasant digs and the hunter 
chases for subsistencf and each nnds at the same time health 
and cheerfulness the penalty of the violation of this organic 
law bv the indulgence of indolence is debility enfeebled action 
both bodilv and mental dyspepsia with all its painful train and 
finally death on the other hand the penalty of over exertion 
debauchery intemperance and excess of every species comes in 
other forms of disease and suffering these laws though not so 
obviously and palpably so are as invariable and inevitable as 
those of attraction or magnetism 

if then by any process of instruction discipline and mental 
force we can influence our circumstances banish grief create 
cheerfulness we can in the same degree reduce rules for the 
pursuit of happiness to a system and make that system a matter 
of science can we not do this — jrt of being happy 

 man has the power of acquiring these habits 

the elements upon which we should operate are circum 
stances habits and modes of thinking and acting the impulse 
of all our actions from birth to death the spring of all oar move 
ments is a conviction that by the blessing and help of the most 
high we can alter and improve our condition we have a con 
sciousness stronger than our reason that we can control our 
circumstances we eon change our regimen and habits and by 
patience and perseverance even our temperament every one can 
cite innumerable and most melancholy instances of those who 
have done it for evil the habit of indulging in opium tobacco 
ardent spirits or any of the pernicious narcotics soon reduces 
the physical and mental constitution to that temperament in 
which those stimulants are felt to be necessary a corresponding 
change is produced in the mind and disposition the frequent 
and regdar use of medicine though it may have been wholly 
unnecessary at first finally becomes an inveterate habit no

useful degree become masters of events and of ourselves — ibid 

the conclusion follows that man has the power of 
making himself happy

it n you agree to it you confess as a consequence that you 
inflict upon the people all the harm you can if you do not agree 
to it then you deny having restricted supply and raised prices

of canals or other public works by the government k 
canals could be profitably opened it would not only be super

to imdertake them for in this case private interests would 
accomplish the object far more economically if they could 
tiot be opened with a profit it would be pernicious to force 
capital into an improductive channel in either case there 
fore nothing but mischief can result from the interference 
of government 

in the same form of reasoning monsieur say argues 
against sumptuary laws sumptuary laws are super 
fluous and unjust the indulgence proscribed is either 
within the means of the individual or not in the former 
case it is an act of oppression to prohibit a gratification 
involving no injury to others in fiie latter case it is at 
all events nugatory to do so for there is no occasion for

the following is the language of lord beaumont a 
catholic nobleman with respect to the recent appointment 
to english bishoprics by the pope — 

 the pope by his illadvised measures has placed the roman 
cathohcs in this country in a position where they must either 
break with eome or violate their alliance to the constitution 
of these reahns they must either consider the papal bull as null 
and void or assert tne right of a foreien prince to create by his 
sovereign authority engosh titles ana to erect english bishop 
rics to send a bishop to beverley for the spiritual direction of 
the boman cathouc cler in yorkshire and to create a see of 
beverley are two very different things — the one is allowed by 
the tolerant laws of the country the other requires territorial 
dominion and sovereign power within the country if you deny 
that this country is a fi of bome and that the pontiff has any 
dominion over it you deny his power to create a territorial see 
and you condemn the late bull as sound and fury signifying 
nothing if on the contrary you admit his power to raise 
westminster into an archbishopric and beverley mto a bishopric 
you make over to the pope a power which according to the con 
stitution rests solely with the queen and her parliament and 
thereby infringe the prerogative of the one and interfere with the 
authority of the other it is impossible to act up to the spirit of 
the british constitution and at tne same time to acknowledge the

the idealist on the contrary rerds it as a shadow a mode of 
mind an iniite projection of his own thought the man who 
stands between the two extremes looks on nature as a great but

between pure and absolute spirit and the incarnate soul of man 
to the materialist there is an altar the tishted heavenhigh but 
no god to the idealist there is a god but no altar he who

this issue of bank notes will caue a general advance in the 
prices of commodities 

this general advance of prices will check exportation and 
encouraffc importation 

this decrease of exports and increase of imports will turn the 
exchanges against us 

the exchimge beinff turned against us will cause a demand for 
the exportation of gold 

this demand for the exportation of gold will cause the notes 
to be taken to the bank ot england and payment demanded in 

the notes in circulation wdl thus be diminished and the cur 
rency will again be placed in a sound state 

the sorites it will be seen embraces a number of argu 
ments connected together it is therefore called a chain 
of reasoning it resembles a chain in this that if one 
hnk be broken the whole argument is destroyed in the 
example we have just given the third link is denied by 
mr tooke who contends that an increase in the amoimt 
of the circulation has no effect on the prices of commo

matical deductions if you pay attention i will give you 
an illustration of this and explain it so clearly siat you

from one of my old schoolbooks 

 when first the marriage knot was tied 

betwixt my wife and me 
my age did hers as far exceed 

as three times three does three 
but when ten years and half ten years 

we man ana wife had been 
her age came up as near to mine 

as eight is to sixteen 

now teu me i pray 

what were our ages on the weddingday

x denotes multiplication and s denotes equality now 
then we will begin the figures c at your left 
hand express the number of operations 

 let the age of the wife on the weddingdaj be represented 
by the letter a 

 then as the husbaads age to the wifes is as three times 
three to three his age must be three times a say x 

 ten years and half ten years are equal to fifteen years 

 at the end of fifteen years the wiles age will be ar 
chat is a added to

 now you know by the rule of three that if the two ex

together the product will be the same as the product of the 
multiplication of the two means that is the second and third 
terms now 

• i multiplied by give or and 
ar multiplied by give us 

 as these two products are equal to each other we thus 
form our equation

you will read the equation thus — twentyfour x plus equal 
sixteen x plus 

 our next operation will be to transpose the ar to the other 
side of the equation in doing this we must of course change 
the sign as it is now plus we must make it minus our equa 
tion will then stand thus 

ar — ar

 we will now transpose the to the other side of the

series of reasonings 

we have shown that a chain of reasoning consists cf a 
number of reasons so connected with each other that the 
failure of one reason would destroy the whole argument 
a series of reasoning denotes a number of reasons all 
bearing to prove the same sentiment but so far imcon 
nected with each other that the eulure of one reason does 
not weaken the force of the others 

it is impossible to lay down rules whereby a number of 
reasons may be so arranged as to produce the best effect 
in establishing the point for which they are adduced 
indeed people who are sufficiently skilled in logic to be 
able to maintain their sentiments in a set discourse must 
have acquired that systematic habit of mind which will sug 
gest the best rules for the arrangement of their thoughts 
for the sake of the young we will transcribe a few rules 
which have chiefly a reference to the writing of themes 
published by an author who has had great experience in 
tuition — 

 in treating of method in reasoning it is common to divide it 
into two kinds analysis and synthesis all however that seems 
necessary to be said in this treatise concerning tbese distinctions 
is that m the mode of reasoning called synthesis the proposition 
is the conclusion sought but in the reasoning called analysis 
the conclusion cannot he previously proposed for till the argu 
ments on which it depends are unfolded it is presumed to be 
unknown in reasoning synthetically the arguer knows before 
hand what is to be estaolished and he may at his option pro 
pose it first and add his arguments afterwards or he may neglect 
to state the intended proposition till he has brought forward 
what he has to advance in support of it in reasoning analyti 
cally the arguer lays down notliing to be proved nor has he any 
foreknown conclusion in view but he goes on unfolding one 
argument after another tiu he reaches a conclusion analysis 
therefore is the way by which we attain truth synthesis that 
by which we communicate it we pursue the method of analysis 
when not having formed our judgment on a subject we tliint to 
ourselves in order to form one we pursue the method of synthesis 

digitized by cjooqic 



sebies of l£asoninos 

when oxlt judgment is formed and we undertake to convince 
others it is scarcely necessary to add that in writing themes 
the principle on which we proceed is synthesis 

before anything more particular is advanced on the method 
of writing themes it must be mentioned that the maraier in 
which a theme is given out determines what latitude is allowed 
to the writer in treating it when a theme is given out thus — 
n education on a knowledge of the world — the theme may 
be called unhmited for the writer is left to lay down any propo 
sitions to be proved which he may think fit provided they bear a 
due relation to the subject but a particular proposition being 
laid down to be proved necessarily limits the tneme as for 
instance when a theme is given out thus — man is the creature 
of education a proper knowledge of the world is favourable 
to virtue this kind of theme is called a thesis — a greek word 
signifying position or proposition — in the plural theses an 
umimitea theme generally contains many theses for whenever 
the writer goes into a new branch of his subject he must lay 
down or have in view some new proposition — that is a thesis 
in a limited theme there is but one main proposition to which 
every other ought to be subservient this main projosition ia 
called by distinction the thesis and the theme which is written 
in support of it takes the same name 

 suppose the theme given out to be friendship — teachera 
recommend the pupil to consider it under the follotoig heads — 
the definition the cause the state in ancient and in modeni 
times the advantages the disadvantas proper answers to 
the follovnng questions will form such a theme as is here 
required — 

 what is friendship what is the cause of friendship 
 what was anciently thought of friendship and what examples 
are on record what is friendship often found to be in these 
days what are the benefits of true friendship what 
are the evils of false friendship 

when instead of an unlimited title a thesis is given out to 
be proved teachers recommend the following heads as helps to 
find the arguments — the proposition the season the confiri 
mation the simile the testimony the example the conclu 
sion ijnder the first head the writer restates his thesis in such 
a shape that the arguments he designs to use will easily connect 
with it under the second he brings forth the strongest direct 
internal argument he can find in popf of it — that is from tho 
nature of the thing from enumeration from the cause the efeect 
the adjuncts the antecedents or the consequents under the 
thurd ne tries to strengthen his proof by showing the absurdity 
of the contrary proposition or by advancing some fresh argument 
of whatever kind that is ot taken from the same sonrqe as tho

facts from historj and lastly he forms his conclusion not

call for explanation and too generally approv of throughout the 
country to stand in need of defence he was not a member of 
the eyoyal commission to which the office had been entrusted of

reference to the specific details he could only make the most 

general remarks and submit the most general grounds which as

the first ground was one of a very genenal character because it 
rested on the constitution of our common nature he liked the 
occasional recurrence of celebrations pomps festivities oom 
memorationscall them by whatever name you please they 
seemed to him in accordance with the feelings and instincts im 
planted in the human breast he did not call to mind any 
country or era which had dispensed with them in the primitive 
east both in ancient and in our own times they were for the 
inost part associated with ceremonies of worship with uncouth 
and too often horrid rites in more enlightened and civilized

strength ennobled it was true by the susceptibility of her peode 
to all the forms of taste and beauty and recorded in immortal 
song among the sterner eoman they generally accompanied 
the long train of martial triumphs up the steep ascent of the

we go back to the ancient jewish church that church we 
know was formed presided over and guided in all things by grod 
i dont myself see that the jews couldknow anything at all about 
our kind of psalmody their psalmody must have been a siecies of 
chanting because from the very nature of hebrew poetry it could 
not have been anything else the poetry and sabred psalms of the 
ancient church were not in common metre long metre and short 
metre such as you have not verses with exact number of feet and 
syllables that can be sung to a tune the poetryof the bible is 
rather in thought though it is also in expression there is an idea 
and then there is the echo of the idea and so the poetry goes on 
idea contrasting or repeating or illustrating idea and thus we have 
puel lines these lines nowever are not of the same length 
nence the very construction of the song prevented its being sung to 
a tune like our psahntune and so the praise of the ancient church 
must of necessity have been of the nature of our chanting and 
not only so but you will see from the very structure of many of 
the psalms that they were responsive one class of the singers 
sang one sentence and another class responded to it we have 
a representation of what i mean in the vision of isaiah where

phonallv we can hardly conceive in reference to the gth 
rsalm but that in worship the manner was to take up each clause 
alternately the th psahn is a very remarkable psalm if you 
look attentively into that you will see that the different clauses 
are constructea to be sung by different jjersons so of the th 
a question is asked by one party of singers and an answer is 
eiven by another party that is these rsahns were composed 
for chanting antiphonally 

to me there is something exceedingly solemn something 
very touclung in looking back to the last supper our lord haa 
penormed the last act with his disciples as jews in the jewish 
church and along with that had established the ordinance of 
the christian dispensation and it was after he had done this — 
ater he had adaed the christian to the jewish that he san a 
hymn with his disciples according to the mode in use in the jewish 
cinurch chanting psalms was the course of the service of praise 
at that time ancfaftor our lord had united with his disciples in 
one of these songs he went forth to that reat agony which was 
to be the subject of the song of the new dispensation why the 
veiy first the jpreatest and sublimest act of praise in the chris 
tian church in which the master and head of that church 
joined would be something in the nature of a chant — the sacred 
song which belong to that peculiar service well then you 
know the same thing must have taken place in the first assem 
blies of chnstians they did not chanffe the jewish lanffuage or 
the form of jewish poctiythere was the introduction of no new 
metrical literature the old songs continued but a new sense was 
attached to the words the songs of the ancient church were 
sung with the glorious assooiatlons oi the new dispensatioil i 
cannot see myself that there was room or opportunity for any 
thing but this kind of praise in the apostdic churdi i am veiy 
mucn disposed to thinr that when the disciples carried out the 
injunction which had been vi them to teach one another in 
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs not only was chanting 
the kind of singing employed but that they answered one an 
other in their songs and whci paul and suas sang praises to 
god while in thr prison it is not improbable that they did this 
antiphonauy 

here it may be remarked that there are no reasons for think 
ing that christian praise was originally official — that the singers 
were kept separate from the congregation and took the singing 
as it were out of their mouth all the people had a right and 
were required to take part in this service it was from the 
circumstance that he people got into the habit of singing without 
proper feeling and decorum that official singing was introduced

it is not consistent with the teaching of our intellectual 
faculties nor with the impulses of our moral feelings that a 
being of immaculate holiness and inflexible justice and possessed 
moreover of omniscience and omnipotence should permit in 
even a single instance that virtue should go unrewarded and 
vice should remain unpunished if the creator of the world 
were not a righteous being he would not have implanted a love 
of righteousness in the minds of his creatures mid if he be 
a righteous being it is reasonable to expect that his righteous 
ness should appear in all the operations of his moral govern 
ment and as we find this is not universally the case we are 
driven to the conclusion that the present state is not a state of 
final retribution that the enjoynients and the auctions of 
the jpresent life are intended cmefly as instruments of moral 
discipline and that there is a future state of existence in which 
the final distribution of rewards and punishments will take place 
thus reason concurs with revelation in teaching us that it is 
appointed unto men once to die and after that the judgment 
the inequalities of the present world will thus be rectified in 
the next and every man wiu be rewarded according to his 
works 

but however satisfactory this solution of the difficulty mav be 
with regard to individuals it does not apply to the case of puolic 
companies their existence commences and terminates in the 
present world and they must be rewarded or punished in the 
present world or they will not be punished or rewarded at all 
in the latter case they are exempted from the moral government 
of grod with them virtue has no reward and vice no punish 
ment in reply to any exhortations to perform their moral and 
religious duties they may exclaim what is the almighty that 
we should serve him andf what profit should we have if we pray 
unto him we biow not the lord neither will we obey m 
voice as however we cannot suppose that god has exempted 
public companies om his moral government we must infer that 
they are punished or rewarded in the present state 

 this conclusion rests upon the same evidence as the argu 
ment we have just stated in the former case the argument 
stands thus — 

the bighteous grovemor of the world must reward the good 
and punish the wicked

him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip 
saith unto him come and see — john i 

 but now let us turn to the remaining topic presented by our 
text—the treatment which a prejudiced man should receive from 
a believer it is very observable that philip declined all contro 
versy with nathanael though a fairer opening could hardly have 
been offered nathanads question migiit ahnost be said to have 
challenged controverey or if not controversy some measure of 
expostulation but philip attempted no correction of the mis 
take into which nathanael had fallen he undertook no aiument 
to prove to him the unreasonableness of his question £us onlv 
anxiety was to bring nathanael into personal communication with 
jesus this was the method which had succeeded with himseh 
and he felt as though it could not possibly fail with another and 
there was great wisdom in this for it does not often happen 
that men are convinced by an argument there is something in tile 
intellectual warfare whatever tne subject which comes under dis

it is indispensable to urge them but they are perhaps less

there is in the contents of the bible of acting as the credentiais

is no evidence of the truth of christianity like that which a man 
knocks out for himself with the simple apparatus of a bible and 
a conscience the thorough suitableness of the gospel — its 
exact adaptation to our wants and our circumstances — in this 
lies a mighty argument that the gospel is from god you admit 
the argument in regard to creation you admit that the precise 
adaptation of the world in which we dwell to the beings who 
inhabit it is a vast proof that a supreme intelligence prepared 
the dwellingplace for the creatures and the creatures for the 
dwellingplace you think that the existence of such a series of 
adjustments and contrivances seems to prove the one made on 
purpose for the other and shows such evidence of design as 
should leave no doubt on the authorship of creation now we 
claim the very same admission in reference to redemption if 
the exact adaptation of the world to our natural circumstances 
be received in eyidence that god made the world the just as 
exact adaptation of the spel to our spiritual circumstances

 the logic of dress —

from an elegant personal appearance are too generally known and 
appreciated throughout civilized europe to require much comment 
here it is only to be lamented that the enormous charges usually 
incident to a desirable apppearance preclude many of limited in 
comes from enjoyinff it while it brinffls down distress upon others 
for i think it wifl almost invariably be found that the firist

these points much logic may be expended both in regard 
to taste and economy 

fair and daek complexions — the appearance of the 
opxmtenance is very greatly suwected to be reheved or depressed 
by the influence of colours to be aware immediately of this 
fact you have only to perceive how wretched white neckcloths 
make some people appear those for instance of a sallow skin 
while on the opposite a black elvet or satin stock throws by 
its comparative depth of hue the former into shade all this is 
either more or less regulated by other colours on dark people 
a dark coat looks best black for the neck most assuredly then 
as too much black would look gloomy they should be reheved by

in mr halls book of the feet we have an example 
of the truths of science being applied to the promotion of 
personal comfort the anatomy of the foot proves the 
injury of tight shoes — 

 there is nothing more beautiful than the structure of the 
human foot says sir charles bell nor perhaps any demonstra 
tion which would lead a welleducated person to desire to know 
more of anatomy than that of the foot the foot has in its 
structure all the fine apphances you see in a building in the 
first place there is an arch in whatever way you regard the foot 
looking down upon it we perceive several bones coming round 
the astroloffos and forming an entire circle of surfaces in the 
contact if we look at the profile of the foot an arch is stiu 
manifest of which the postenor part is formed by the heel and 
the anterior by the ball of the gieat toe and in the front we 
find in that direction a transverse arch so that instead of 
standing as might be imagined on a sohd bone we stand upon 
an arch composed of a series of bones which are united by the 
most curious provision for the elasticity of the foot hence if we 
jump from ajieight directly upon the heel a severe shock is felt 
not so if we ahght upon the ball of the great toe for there an 
elasticity is formed in the whole foot and the weight of the body 
is thrown upon this arch and the shock avoided 

 for upwards of twenty years as a bootmaker i have made 
the feet my study and during that period many thousand pairs 
of feet have received my attention i have observed with mmute 
care the cast from the antique as well as the modem instances

 we sav disproportion of age for allowing their years to be 
equal as they usually are the lady is virtually many years in

man is at twentyeight that is to say she has ass much world 
knowledge as much tact as much finesse as much judgment of 
character as much selfpossession as much — cunning we were 
going to say but that is rather a harsh term to apply to a lady 

 now tms disproportion of ages gives rise to many senous 
evils so many that we hardly know which to beg with the 
yonng women must despise or at least undervalue the young men 
with whom they associate as inferior to themselves m manner 
tact and conversational power hence they form a low opinion 
of men as men and are tempted to value them onlj for their 
external advantage — personal beauty skill in dancmg— above 
all wealth here is a fearful incentive to mercenary marriages 
but we prefer to confine ourselves to its effects on married life 
the bride and brideeroom are the same age say twentythree or 
four unless indeed sne happens to be a year older than he in 
a mere external and physical point of view the first consequence 
is that she is an old woman while he is in the prime of life for 
though both sexes among us are too apt to break themselves down 
and grow old before their time this premature decay is more 
general and more speedy with our females the inconveniences 
mistakes mortifications and jealousies that constantly arise from 
such discrepancy are too evident to require more than being 
hinted at but this is nothing to the moral phase of the ques

where they are not influenced by higher motives ought to induce

 the logic of social intercourse — 

 what is it then that constitutes a gentleman in your mind 
not his station — for he may disgrace it not his power — for he 
may misuse it not his graces and endowments — for you may 
despise them it is in the nakedness of truth because he pos 
sesses qualities which ennoble him and shed a lustre over his

actions in their utter separation from those of the common herd 
by whom he is surrounded because you see in that man a depth 
ot feeling and right principle which you look in vain for in the 
ordinary run of the men you meet 

 when then you hear any one giving himself airs and despis 
ing his part in the world you will say immediately that he can 
not have the true feeling of a gentleman because instead of 
looking into his ow mind as the seat and source of honour he 
descends to the external trappings and decorations of his office 
and only regards himself with complacency as he glitters in the 
eyes of others 

 again should you unfortunately find yourself embroiled iu 
any dispute or quarrel — which may occur to the most peaceable 
—and perceive on reflection that you have been betrayed by the 
heat of the moment into any intemperance or that there is any 
one point in which you are not completely satisfied with yourself 
— do not fancy it derogatory to your manhood to acknowledge 
your eifror ana to make a just reparation you may at first 
have an idea that it is inconsistent with true courage to make 
this concession and that you should bear the brunt ofthe offence 
with a total disregard of personal consequences but as you mix 
more with the world you will find that in veiy many cases a 
much higher degree of courage is necessary to the avowal of a 

fault than to sustaining it we should wish you to be firm 

as a rock in repelling an aggression or an insult — but still we 
would strongly impress upon you that it is in every case far 
more consistent with high courage and gentlemanly feelings to 
own a wrong than to defend it and to afiay than to confinn an 
injury 

when therefore you enter into society whatever may be the 
state of your mindy put such a restraint on the expression of it 
that you shall appear pleased and cheerful consider that people 
meet together for instruction and enjoyment and to rub out the 
cares and cobwebs of the day you wish to join them to promote 
these good objects and if you are so dispirited and careworn 
that you cannot promote them a just and correct tone of feeling 
would induce you to remain at home 

 there are two or three minor subjects that occur to me 
 which may be dismissed at once in a few words on no account 
swear or use cant terms never be inquisitive never interrupt 
a speaker always take off your hat to a woman scrupulously 
acknowledge the salute of a poor man eat slowly and quietly 
and without any show of eagerness this last is a serious sole

vigilant of offending against its recognised proprieties i will not

 the first is the value of acquired knowledge a person who 
has studied the game of chess and knows it will beat with ease 
and certainty one of much more talent for the game who under

 the second is encouragement never to give up a losing game

some years ago i commenced a work on the riilosophy 
of history it was proposed to be written in the form of 
lectures after writing two lectures i was compelled 
from want of leisure to lay the subject aside and it will 
probably never be resumed the conmiencement of the 
work may now for the first time be useful by standing at 
the head of this section — 

 philosophy has been defined the knowledge of the reasons 
of things m oppositioa to history whidi is the bare knowledge

of facts or to mathematics which is the knowledge of the quan 
tity of things or tlieir measures it is the royince of philosophy 
to collect uther those facts which hae occurred to investi 
gate their causes and operations and to classify them according 
to the principles they may have developed it is thus that the 
chemist takes erery object in nature examines its constituent 
principles notices their operation when brought into combination 
with other bodies and from the effects he observes he forms 
those general rules which are universally true and which when 
arranged and demonstrated form what may be called the philo 
sophy of the science 

thus it is in every branch of experimental philosophy at 
first the substances of water or air or other natural objects are 
merely observed by and by a few experiments are made upon 
tiiem other experiments follow and either correct or connrm 
those which preceded experiments are multiplied until it is 
found at last that in a variety of instances the same experiments 
are uniformly followed by the same results these are then con 
sidered as established truths the knowledge thus acquired is 
acted upon in the investigation of other bodies fresh truths are 
elicited and the whole body of truths or general principles thus 
established by repeated experiments constitute what is tenned 
natural and experimental philosophy 

 but this course of procedure is not confined to material sub 
stances the moralist observes minutely what actions conduce 
to happiness and what lead to misery those actions which lead 
to happiness he calls good or virtuous those actions which lead 
to misery he calls bad or vicious he examines the causes or 
motives from whence those actions proceed and he considers the 
motives to be good or evil according to the good or bad actions 
they produce hence he forms general rules by which he declares 
that certain classes of actions or motives are good and ought to 
be inculcated while other classes of actions or motives are evil 
and ought to be condemned he compares these rules with the 
relations which man sustains in reference to other beings in the 
universe hence to examine the reasonableness and propriety 
of moral conduct and to investigate and lay down rules for 
moral action constituto what is termed the science of moral 
philosophy 

 thus too the political economist views the increase and the 
diminution of thoe products which constitute national wealth 
he traces the various circumstances by which either the one or 
the other may be promoted and from the observation of indi 
vidual examples and instances he lays down general principles 
for the regulation of future conduct in affiedrs of state economy 
this constitutes the philosophy of the science 

 political economy beaits the same relation to history as morab

application of reasoning to history 

do to biography history records those facts which have oc 
curred in tlie atfairs of nations from these facts political eco 
nomy derives her principles she arranges these facts not 
according to their chronological order but accordingly as they 
concurred in exhibiting the good or evil of any line of political 
conduct so biography records those events that have occurred 
in the lives of individuals and the moralist hence derives prin 
ciples for the regulation of individual conduct 

 all philosophy whether it refer to material or immaterial sub 
jects is tounded on fact it is not philosophy to build castles in 
the air to fancy theories and then maintain them in defiance of 
evidence if we wish to lay any claim to the character of philo 
sophers we must not first assume principles and then hunt for 
facts in order to establish them out our principles must be 
deductions from the facts with which we were previously ac 
quainted 

when however the facts by which our principles are sup 
ported are so numerous or so decisive that few persons are 
disposed to dispute the conclusion to which thev lead it is not 
always necessary in teaching our general principles to detail all 
the individual facts upon which they may be founded a few 
pertinent examples are sufficient for the purpose 

 from what i have said hone of my auoitors will be at a loss 
to conjectie what ideas i attach to the philosophy of history 
the philosophy of history means those general principles which 
the facts oi history clearly establish it is not therefore my 
intention to detail all the events which are recorded in the page 
of history i shall attelnpt to exhibit those principles which are 
deduced from those events and shall consider those events them 
selves not in their chronological order but as they tend to esta 
blish the principles i had previously advanced 

the philosophy xf history takes a much wider range than 
political economy the economist views only those facts which 
nave an influence on the accumulation of national wealth the 
philosopher views also those facts which have a reference to the 
character of man to the development of his physical powers 
the exercise of his intellectual faculties his progress in scientific 
inquiry the formation of domestic and civil society and his 
performance of moral and religious duties 

 in pursuing these inquiries i propose to deliver five lectures 
the first will be on the pnilosophy of geographical history the 
second the philosophy oi domestic history the third the 
philosophy of intellectual history the fourth the philosophy 
of pohtical history fifthly thd philosophy of ecclesiastical 
history 

 in the first lecture upon the philosophy of geographical 
history i propose to inquire what are the effects which history 
p

records to have been produced upon naui and upon human society 
by geographical circumstances — by the varieties of climate by 
the mountainous character of countries by tlie fertility or bar 
renness of the soil or by the intervention of rivers or arms of 
the sea 

 in the second lecture i shall inquire what is the language 
of history as to the relation of husband and wife the institu 
tions of polygamy and divorce the relation between parents and 
children masters and servants and the rise and progress of 
domestic slavery this lecture will be on the philosophy of 
domestic history 

in the thira lecture on the philosophy of intellectual or 
scientific history i shall inquire into the circumstances which 
have developed the intellectual faculties the rise and progress 
of the arts the circumstances by which they are promoted or 
retarded the advantages which the modems have over the 
ancients and the benefits io be expected from universal 
education 

 in the fourth lecture upon the philosophy of political his 
tory i shall inquire what is the evidence of history as to the 
origin of government the advantages and disadvantages of par 
ticular forms of government and the union of the simple forms 
in the british constitution 

 in the fifth lecture upon the philosophy of ecclesiastical 
history i propose to examine whether it is obvious from history 
that man is endowed with a moral sense to inquire what are the 
different forms of polytheism and hoy far it is necessary that 
the church should be established by the civil power and to trace 
the influence of religion upon the political intellectual and social 
happiness of man 

we shall now point out some of the different ways in 
which logic is applied to history 

 logic is applied to history in examining the evidenoe 
either for or against the truth of disputed facts — 

without this exercise of the reasoning faculties books wiu 
as often mislead as instruct us in making an estimate of the 
authenticity of historical relations three principal rules are to be 
observed — the probability or improbability of the facts recorded 
the nature of the evidence attesting them and in what degree 
they are corroborated or contradicted by the general circum 
stances of the world in the period of time alluded to on these 
principles the reader must exercise a discretionary power of 
yielding or suspending his belief but he ought carefully to avoid 
the two extremes of scepticism and credulity which are equally

 i add yet further that in the historical part of scripture we 
read the holy lawi of ood exemplified in the life and practice of 
good men in seyersd ages of the world and when we see the 
rules of religion copied out in the words and actions of our feuow

and more delightful to us while the word of command stands 
in the law to require our obedience the actual obedience of our

section iii 

the application of thb art of reasonina to politioal 
economy 

 political economy is the name which is given to the 
science of wealth adam smith does not use this name 
but simply calls his work an inquiry into the nature 
and causes of the wealth of nations a political econo 
mist is one who studies or explains the doctrines of political 
economy he is not merely one who believes malthuss 
theory of the population huskissons system of free trade 
ricaidos theory of rent and sir robert peels opinions on 
the currency these doctrines do not constitute the 
science they are some of the disputed doctrines of the 
science he who rejects them is in our view as much a 
political economist as he who maintains them 

i am not going to teach you political economy but 
merely to give you a few hints as to the use of the art 
of reasoning in acquiring a knowledge of some of its 
principles — 

t — the art of reasoning then will teach you that you 
should understand clearly the nature of the science you 
intend to learn 

 the science of political economy is intimately connected with 
the daily occurrences of life and in this respect differs materially 
from that of chemistrjr astronomy or any of the natural sciences 
the mistakes we may fall into in the latter sciences can have little 
sensible effect upon our conduct whilst our ignorance of the for 
mer may lead us into serious practical errors there is scarcely 
any history or any account of voyages or travels that does not 
abound with facts and opinions the bearings of which cannot be 
miderstood without some previous acquaintance with the prin 
ciples of political economy besides should the author himself 
be deficient in this knowledge you will be continually liable to 
adopt his errors from inability to detect them 

this science is essentially founded upon history — not the his 
tory of sovereigns of wars and of intrigues but the history of 
the arts of trade of discoveries and of civilization we see 
some countries hke america increase rapidly in wealth and pro

sperity whilst others kke egypt and syria are impoverished 
depopulated and falling to decay when the causes which produce 
these various effects are well understood some judgment may he 
formed of the measures which governments have adopted to con 
tribute to the welfare of their people whether such or such a 
branch of commerce should be encouraged in preference to others 
whether it be proper to prohibit this or that kind of merchandise 
whether any peculiar encouragement should be given to agriccd 
ture whether it be riht to establish by law the price of pro 
visions or the price of labour or whether they should be left 
without control and so on you see tlierefore that political 
economy consists of two parts — theory and practice the science 
and the art the science comprehends a knowledge of the facts 
which we have enumerated the art relates more prticularly to 
legislation and consists in doing whatever is requisite to contri 
bute to the increase of national wealth and avoiding wiiatever 
would be prejudicial to it — mn marcefs coweruuions tm 
political economy 

ii — the art of reasoning will teach you to be systematic 
and methodical in your studies 

dr watts observes in his improvement of the mind 
that the best way to learn any science is to begin witji 
a regular system or a short and plain scheme of that 
science well drawn up into a narrow compass omitting 
the deeper and more abstruse parts of it and he remarks 
in another place that if a man in his younger days has 
arranged all his sentiments in any particular order it will 
be much more natural and easy for him to continue to dis 
pose all his further acquirements in the same order and 
he illustrates this by the arrangement of books in a library 
when we have accustomed ourselves to any particular ar 
rangement we can find a book more readily than if they 
were again to be arranged in even a better order 

eeoent writers on political economy have usually divided 
the science into four parts — production distribution in 
terchange and consumption under the first division 
they have considered labour and capital under the second 
rent profit and wages under the third commerce and 
money and under the fourth the consumption of gjovem 
ment ajid that of individuals it cannot be denied that 
there is a neatness in this division and doubtless all the 
tcic of the scienfie may be discussed under one or other

of these heads but perhaps we cannot have a better divi 
sion of the science than into — the nature — the causes — 
and the effects of national wealth under the first head 
you might enumerate the articles that constitute wealth 
unde the second head specify the causes and under the 
third head trace the consequences of wealth on the happi 
ness intelligence and morals of the population fec the 
main object of a plan is to assist the memory by a syste 
matic arrangement of your knowledge and the neit object 
is to be able to adjust under some head or division of your 
plan any additional knowledge you may acquire 

the nature of national wealth is thus described by one 
who was both a poet and a monarch — 

 bid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children 
whose month speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right 
hand of falsehood that onr sons may be as plants grown up in 
their youth that our daughters mav lie as comer stones polished 
after the simihtude of a palace that our gamers may be full 
affording all manner of store that our sheep may bnng forth 
tiiousands and ten thousands in our streets that our oxen may 
be strong to labour that there be no breaking in nor going out 
that there be no complaining in our streets happy is that people 
that is in such a case yea happy is that people whose groa is 
the lord— ptfi cxuv — 

the causes of wealth may be thus enumerated — 

 the physical characteristics of a country are a source 
of its wealth

 the moral habits of its population are a source of its 
wealth 

 the hand of the diligent maketh rich — he that loveth plea 
sure shall be a poor man he that loveih wine and oil shall not be 
rich — the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and 
drowsiness shall dothe a man with rags — he that tilleth his land 
shall be satisfied with bread but he that followeth after vain per 
sons shall have poverty enough — he that is slothful in his work 
is brother to him that is a great waster — k prudent man fore 
seeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are 
punished — the sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold 
therefore shall he beg in harvest and nave nothing — love not 
sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou 
shalt be satisfied with bread — in all labour there is profit but 
the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury — book of proverbs 

 let us in conclusion take for our practical government our 
last observation — the commerce of a country depends upon the 
character of the people let us never forget that the mam cause 
of the prosperity of any country or of any city lies in the mental 
and moral character of its inhabitants every possible advant 
of situation may be rendered nugatory by the misconduct of the 
people if instead of availing themselves of these natural ad 
vantages and persevering in the steady pursuits of trade the 
merchants neglect their business or have recourse to swindling 
or gambling or smuggling they will assuredly bring upon them 
selves that ruin and degradation which such practices never fail 
to produce it is by honesty by industry by prudence by per 
severance and by public spirit that nations and cities are made to 
prosper — lectures on ancient commerce

and the laws affecting property are more numerous in commercial 
than in other countries because the modes of acquiring and 
conveying property are more numerous and the rights of dif 
ferent cgdmants cannot be so easily defined commerce is 
affected by all laws relating to the production of commercial 
commodities — the mode of transferring property — the facility or 
transport — the laying on of taxes — or the punisnment of crimes 
besides these general laws which affect all branches of com

trades or the export and import of particular commodities —

 banking institutions cannot flourish in any society in which 
property is insecure whether that insecurity arises from the 
tyranny of the government the turbulence of the people or the 
incursions of foreim enemies in oriental countries where the 
possession of weith invites the rapacity of the government 
people conceal their wealth by burying it in the earth and hence 
we read in scripture of treasures hid in a field a similar prac 
tice prevailed in europe during the times of the feudal svstem 
and treasuretrove was a source of royal revenue as all the con 
cealed treasure when found belonged to the kinff in the early 
ages of greece property was very insecure partly from the tur 
bulence of the people partly from the incursions of the neighbour

and the sanctity of the place preserved it from violation even 
hostile tribes would not take this treasure lest they should incur

 manufacturing nations rise to wealth from the additional 
value which tbey give to the raw materials for there is an im 
mense difference between the value of the raw materials and the 
value of the same materials in a manufactured state thus for 
instance it has been stated that a pound of cotton wool when 
spun bas been worth five pounds sterling and when wove into 
muslin and ornamented in the tambour is worth fifteen pounds 
yielding per cent on the raw material an ounce of fine 
rianders thread nas been sold in london for four pounds such 
an ounce made into lace may be sold for forty pounds which is 
ten times the price of standard gold weight for weight steel 
may be made three hundred times dearer than standard cold 
weight for weight six steel wire springs for watch pendulums 
weigh one gram to the artist seven shilungs and sixpence each 
equal to two pounds five shillings one grain of gold coats onlv

 colonies are a source of wealth they are a certidn

 the greeks established colonies for the nurpose of getting 
rid of a superabundant population and their colonies soon became 
independent the soman colonies were established partly for the 
same purpose and partly for the purpose of acting as garrisons 
and thus keeping possession of the countries they had conquered 
the tvrians and carthaginians established colonies for the pur 
pose of extending their trade the tjrians are said to have planted 
forty colonies in different parts of the mediterranean and the 
carthaginians periodically sent out a number of their citizens in 
new places where they thought an advantageous trade might be 
opened— ibid

nations would ssly overlook tneir own interests if they per

example we had a monopoly of the suppfy of coal it would not 
be difficult to show that it would be good policy with a view to 
the increase of national wealth and security either wholly to pro 
hibit or to lay a high duty on its exportation and so in other 
instaiices tne recent history of the theory of jpulation affords 
a striking instance of the abuse of general principles or rather of 
the folly of building exclusively upon one set of principles with 
out attending to the influence of the antagonist principles by 
which they are partly or wholly countervailed the principle of 
increase as explained by mr iialthus and more recently by dr 
chalmers appeared to form an insuperable obstacle to all per 
manent improvement in the condition of society and to condemn 
the eat majority of the human race to a state approaching to 
destitution 

 the real difficulty does not lie in discussing matters connected 
with this science in the statement of general principles or in 
reasoning fairly from them but it lies in the discovery of the 
secondary or modifying principles which are always in action and 
in making proper allowance for their influence grenerally 
indeed we may predicate with considerable confidence the more 
immediate results that would follow the adoption of any novel 
system of measures but it is extremely difficult or rather per

when you read history you will observe that the 
sources of national wealth were as well understood in 
ancient as in modem times that more com could be 
produced jfrom the soil than was necessary for the wants 
of the population and the surplus could be sold to 
foreigners was as well known in egypt and sicily as it is

at athens and at carthage as they have since been at 
amsterdam and london and the eomans knew the ad 
vantages to be gained by facility of intercourse as well as 
it is now known by the advocates of our modem railways 
and with regard to moral causes that industry frugality 
and prudence are the road to wealth is as distinctly taught 
in the proverbs of solomon as in any of our modem sys 
tems of political economy and the denunciations of the 
prophets against fraud robbery injustice and oppression 
are proofe that they taught the doctrine that security of 
property is essential to national prosperity

cerns the welfare of others and a new discovery of any 
important principle may cause you to become a public

adverse to morality and religion and the investigation of 
its doctrines is not attended with that danger to which 
weak minds are exposed by the study of the abstract 
principles of morals and metaphysics study it because 
it will lead your mind into the contemplation of the divine

section iv 

the application op the art op reasoning to statistics 

 the nature and extent of the science of statistics is 
thus described in the sixth annual report of the statis 
tical society of london — 

the first sentence of the prospectus of the society issued in 
 which states that the object of its estabushment is to 
procure arrange and publish facts calcukted to illustrate the 
condition and prospects of society contains perhaps the best 
definition of statistics which has yet been attempted and if it 
be imperfect its imperfection assuredly consists m its being not 
too narrow but too comprehensive statistics as thus defined 
and as a branch of study worthy of oiur efforts are assuredly not 
the mere method of stating the observations and experiments 
of the physical or other sciences as seems in some instances to 
have been supposed such was not the duty assigned to this 
society by its rounders — it was not to perfect the mere art of 
tabulatiuff that it was embodied— it was not to make us 
hewers and drawers to those engaged on any edifice of physical 
science — but it was that we should ourselves be the architects 
of a science or of sciences the perfecters of some definite brandi 
or branches of knowledge whicn should do honour to ourselves 
and our country and at the same time to the distinguished men 
who summoned us to the labour the elaborators in fine of 
truths which we feel to be necessary to our happiness but which 
are yet wholly hidden fiom ns or but partially revealed 

the whole field of our labours appears to be divisible into the 
following chief sections — 

 the statistics of physical geography division and ap 
propriation or geographical and proprietary statistics 

 the statistics of production or agricultural mining 
fishing manufacturing and commercial statistics 

iii the statistics of instruction or ecclesiastical scien 
tific literary and academical statistics 

iv the statistics of protection or constitutional legal 
judicial and criminal statistics 

v the statistics of consumption and enjoyment or of 
population distribution consumption diversions lile health and 
paoho and private charity 

 the importance of the science is now uniyersally 
acknowledged it is manifested in the attention paid by 
the government to the register of births marriages and

deaths and by the anxiety shown at the present time with 
rard to the census it was not always so the following 
are extracts from a letter i addressed on the th of 
october to the then prime minister the earl of 
liverpool — 

 under these circumstances i beg leave to suggest to your 
lordship the propriety of establishing a pubuo register of all 
births not baptisms marriages and deaths that may occur in 
the nation including all the circumstances of sex age and occu 
pation of tlie parties 

the utility of such a measure is obvious lidependently of 
its use in ascertaining the descent of every individual and thus 
preventing disputed successions it would possess numerous ad 
vantages the system of insurance on lives would be perfected 
the influence of different occupations or of different parts of 
the country in extending or abridging the term of human life 
would be clearly exhibited the theories which are now advo 
cated in regard to population would be confuted or confirmed 
a variety ot useful truths equally curious and important would 
be elicited and the science of political economy instead of rest 
ing on probability and conjecture woidd be founded on the rock 
of mathematical certainty it would then be easy to ascertain 
the exact number of each respective class or of any given age iu 
society and the information thus obtained might be usefully 
applied to subjects connected with taxation to quotas required 
for military service and to a variety of other subjects 

had such a register been established three centuries ago 
what a fund of knowledge would it supply what a number of 
tedious and expensive lawsuits would have been prevented how 
many visionary theories would have been suppressed how dis 
tinctly should we be able to trace the progress of national pro

a regulation

multiplication and diyision the calculation of ratios and 
the construction of tables 

in treating of the relation of a whole and its parts in 
the second section of the second part of this worl i haye 
observed that we employ multiplication when we wish to 
magnify the importance of any matter and division when 
we wish to produce a contrary effect thus if a party 
wished to show that the established church is in posses 
sion of enormous wealth he would endeavour to obtain an 
account of all ecclesiastical property and present it in one 
sum but if another party wished to produce a different 
impression he would divide this sum by the number of 
clergymen and contend that upon an average they do not 
deceive individually a higher income than an educated 
man should receive for the kind of duty he performs 
it was by simple multiplication that mr g r porter 
ascertained the amount spent annually in the purchase of 
spirits beer and tobacco— sums which he happily styled 
 selfimposed taxes the following is the amount taken 
from the paper he read on the subject at edinburgh be 
fore the statistical section of the british association —

employed is a per centage for example if we wish to show

there is scarcely a science from which so many usem 
truths may so readily be drawn as from statistics by 
new truths i mean of course truths that are new to us 
no truth is new in itself the doctrine of gravitation was 
a truth in itself before it was discovered by newton but 
he made us acquainted with it it is only in this sense 
that any truth can be new by statistics many discoveries 
have been made— discoveries too of great importance — 
and made by very simple means for instance it was a 
new discovery in edinburgh last year that the annual con 
sumption of spirits in scotland was in the proportion of 
lie gallons to every individual while in ireland it was in 
the proportion of gallons and iii england it was only 
in the proportion of gallons it was akso a new trutik 
that the wealth of the lower classes is increasing— and in 
creasing too in a higher proportion than that of the higher 
classes for these truths we areindebted to mr porter 

 peoportions op rich and pook— in a paper read by 
mr poiter before the british associatiod he shows that it is 
altogether a mistake to suppose that the rich are growing richer 
and the poor are becoming poorer in this country for there is 
abundant evidence of a much larger increase in the numbers 
of the middle classes than of either the rich or the poor he 
states that between and there was a great pni 
tionate increase in the number of small dividends paid at the 
bank of england to the holders of money in the funds also 
that the incomes from trades and professions above ayear 
which paid income tax only amounted in to 
whilst m they amounted to and that the in 
comes below ayear had increased several milkons beyond 
any other class of incomes further that the personal property 
on which probate duty was paid increased from in 
 to in — of which the increase was chiefly 
in the smaller properties the conclusion of mr porter is justi 
fied by these figures and it is one that should remove the 
popular prejudice on the subject — a prejudice that is equally 
painful and mischievous 

these new truths are sometimes discovered by simple 
multiplication and division as already shown sometimes 
by ratios and sometimes by placing interesting informa 
tion in a tabular form

new and highly important truths are sometimes ascer 
tained by merely observing if any specific facts reoccur at 
tertain periods when we hare ascertained any unifor 
mity in the occurrence of certain events we call that uni 
formity a law thus those uniformities that were found 
to occur in regard to the deaths at various ages are now 
called the laws of mortality a few years ago a com 
mittee of the house of commons published the average 
nujntmp circulation for several years of the notes that 
bad been issued respectively by the bank of england 
the coimtry banks the banks of scotland and the banks 
of ireland from these returns mr gilbart deduced 
what he terms the laws of the currency — 

we will take the monthly retnms of the circulation for the 
period that is past that is from the end of september to 
the end of and endeavour by observing their various revo 
hitions to discover if thev are governed by any fixed causes or 
princiijles— to ascertain if those principles are uniform in their 
operation and if we should discover that the revolutions of the 
currency are regulated by any uniform principles we shall call 
thoseprincinles ihe laws of the currency 

we shall begin with that portion of the currency which con 
sists of notes issued by the bank of england on looking over 
the monthly circulation of the bank ol england ven m the 
table no in the appendix to the report of we 
observe that the circulation of the months in which the public 
dividends are paid is higher than in the subsequent months thus 
the average circulation of january is higher than that of eebruary 
or march the circulation of april is higher than that of may 
or june the circulation of july is higher than that of august 
or september and the circulation of october is higher tnan 
that of november or december this then we may consider as 
one law of the circulation of the bank of england — that it ebbs 
and flows four times in the year in consequence of the payment 
of the quarterly dividends this law aoes not apply to any 
other bank as au the government dividends are paid by the 
bank of england 

 on inspecting the monthly returns of the country circulation 
for the last ten years we find that the highest amwmt is in the 
month of april thence it descends and arrives at the lowest 
point by the end of august which is the lowest point in the

year it gradaallj increases to noyember a slight reaotita 
takes place in december bat it then advances until it reaches tlie 
highest point in april the general law is that the countiy dr 
ciuation always makes one circuit in the year — being at its lowest 
point in august and advancing to december and continuing to 
advance to its highest point m the month of april and then 
again descending to its lowest point in august 

 in scotland the lowest pomt of the circulation is in march 
and the highest in november the advance however between 
these two points is not uniform — for the highest of the interven 
ing months is may after which there is a ight reaction but it 
increases again until november and falls off m december the 
reason of the great increase in may and november is that these 
are the seasons of making payments the interest due on mort 
gages is then settled aimuities are then paid the country people 
usually take the interest on their deposit receipts and the 
servants receive their wages there are frequently large sums 
transferred by way of mortgage it is the custom of scotland 
to settle all transactions large as well as small by bank notes— 
not by cheques on bankers as in london it is remarkable that 
these montlily variations occur uniformly every year while the 
amount of the circulation in the corresponding months of different 
years undergoes comparatively very little change 

 from what we have already said of the lawf the currency 
those of our readers who are acquainted with ireland will be able 
to judge beforehand of the revolutions of her circulation being 
purely an agricultural country the lowest points will of coarse 
dc in august or september immediately before the harvest and 
the commencement of the cattle and bacon trade then it rises 
rapidly till it reaches its highest point in january and then 
gradually declines as an agricultural country we should natu 
rally expect that during the season of increase the circulation 
would expand most in the rural districts and so we find that 
the circulation of the bank of ireland in dublin expands very 
moderately — that of her branches which are located chieflj in 
large towrns expands more — while the circulation of the joint 
stck banks which are located in the agricultural districts 
reeeives the largest increase again the purchases and sales of 
agricultural produce are known to be in small amounts and 
hence the notes of the smallest denomination receive the largest 
relative increase the annual changes of the irish circnlation 
are governed chiefly by the produce of the harvest and the 

e rices of agricultural products these are the laws of the circa 
ition of ireland — oilbarfs practical treaiise on banking

if we foimd that the consumption of spirits had decreased 
m a distaict while the consumption of tea and coffee had 
increased we should infer that the population had become 
more temperate and if the number of schools had in 
creased we should infer that the people had become 
better instructed the following statistics from dickenss 
 household words are an indication of the intelligence 
of the inhabitants of london 

the area of a single morning paper — the times say — is 
more than nineteen and a half square feet or nearly five feet by 
four compared with an ordinary octavo volume the quantity 
of matter daily issued is equal to three hundred pages there 
are four morning papers whose superficies are nearly as great with 
out supplements which they seldom publish a fifth is only half 
the size we may reckon therefore that the constant craving 
of the londoners for news is supplied every morning with as 
much as would fill about twelve hundred pages of an ordinary 
novel or not less than five volumes 

 the relation of cause and efifect has a close con 
nexion with statistics indeed we may almost give the 
same definition of statistics which has been given of 
philosophy the science which teaches the causes of 



we discover the causes of things in various ways 

sometimes statistics will merely give us the facts 
and we have to ascertain the causes from other sources 
thus we have fluctuation in the prices of com — of the 
funds — and we have to judge of the causes here there 
is much room for difference of opinion for instance 
statistics will tell us that there was a great fell in the price 
of the funds in february — history will tell us that 
just before this occurred the devolution in france we 
may therefore infer with confidence that the french revo 
lution was the cause of a decline in the english funds 
but generally the relation of cause and effect is less 
obvious and less sudden and consequently there is more 
occasion for soimd reasoning 

sometimes the causes of things are discovered by taking 
two similar series of figures from two different toccdities 
thus at the time of the cholera the number of deaths 
wtt registered in a district where the people drank im

pfore water and in another district where the people 
drank pure water and aa ihe deaths were far more nume 
rous in the former looalitj it was inferred that impure 
water produced the cholera so in india the number of 
deaths from disease in the different regiments stationed 
in different parts of india was ascertained and it was 
inferred that in the places where the deaths were most 
numerous the climate was most unhealthy 

sometimes the causes of things are discovered by 
taking similar series of facts at different periods thus 
the number of letters passed through the post office before 
the adoption of the penny postage and subsequent to 
that event will show the effect of that measure in in 
creasing the nimiber of letters 

sometimes causes are shown by two series of figures — 
one representing the effect and the other the cause thus 
if we have from various districts a series of figures show 
ing the number of schools in each district and another 
column of figures showing the number of crimes com 
mitted in each district and if we find that generally the 
niunber of crimes is in an inverse proportion to the num 
ber of schools we may then infer that want of education 
is the cause of crime 

causes are often discovered by various and minute 
classifications we ascertain the number people that 
die annually out of a given population with this know 
ledge only we should do as the amicable insurance did 
when first established — charge the same premium on all 
lives indiscriminately but we classify this total according 
to their ages and hence we can charge a premium pro 
portionate to the age we go further and classify the 
male and female lives and again we vaiy our premiums 
we may again subdivide according to tiie districts and 
ascertain how far the probabilities on life in the country 
vary from those in cities again we may classify accord 
ing to employments and ascertain the influence of employ 
ments on the duration of himian life so we may take 
a number of criminals and classify them according to their 
antecedents — that is according to their previous circum 
stances in regard to age residence employment character 
of parents ucation c c and hence attempt to dis

cover those circumstances that kad to the formation of 
character and therefore tend to produce crime 

the principle of classification— that is of genus and 
species — is of very extensive use in statistics and we can 
rarely apply it in any case without obtaining some impor

 in reply to a statistical argument mr canning ex 
claimed — not figures but fects all figures should 
represent cts but we cannot deny that even the facts 
represented by figures may like other foots become the 
basis of erroneous reasoning 

our reasoning may be erroneous firom the inaccuracy 
of the data in some cases no records may have been kept 
and hence we have no authenticated facts from this 
cause our reasoning may be defective respecting the po 
pulousness of ancient nations — the average duration of 
life in le middle ages — the amount of the revenue the 
pope derived from england previous to the reformation 
sometimes when records have been kept they are defective 
thus the produce of the gold and silver mines in america 
and in bussia has been calculated from the amount of 
the duty paid to the state but of coiurse we have no

leoord of the cases in which the duty has been evaded 
we have records of the importation of tobacco but we 
can have no records of the quantity introduced by smug 
glers we know the quantity of spirits that pay duty 
in great britain and ireland every year but we have no 
records of the illicit distillation 

so in taking our series of figures from different coun 
triesy we are liable to error in making comparisons between 
those things to which these series of figures may respec 
tively refer the prices of commodities for instance 
though referring to things called by the same name may 
not refer to things of the same kind or the same quality 
in comparing the wages of difierent countries we may be 
jed astray for the quantity of labour rendered in return 
for these respective rates of wages may very much differ 
when the union between england and ireland was under 
consideration in the house of commons mr wilberforce 
presented a petition firom the woollen manucturers of 
yorkshire praying to be protected against the low wages 
of ireland it was presumed that if woollen manufactures 
were established in ireland they would be able from 
the low rate of wages to undersell those of yorkshire 
obtain duties cajl union duties were accordingly 
continued for twenty years but though those duties 
have ceased for thirty years the woollen manufactures 
notwithstanding the low wages have shown no disposition 
to take flight from leeds to galway 

we are sometimes led astray in making comparisons 
between two series of figures by confining our attention 
simply to the figures without noticing the different cir 
cumstances of the respective periods to which those figures 
refer thus during the commercial pressure of the 
chancellor of the exchequer stated to some deputations 
that waited upon him on the subject that the restrictions 
on the issue of bank notes by the act of could not 
be the cause of the pressure for the amoimt of notes then 
in circulation was higher than it had been in former years 
when no pressure existed it was afterwards stated before 
the parliamentary committee that of the notes in circula 
tion above z were locked up in the vaults of the 
london and country bankers as a provision for any

emand that might be made upon them for payment of 
their notes or deposits 

sometimes as we have stated two series of figures 
will by their correspondence show that the facts denoted 
in one series are le cause of the facts denoted in the 
other series but this will not be imiformly the case 
we cannot always conclude that because two rows of 
figures increase simultaneously therefore the facts regis 
tered by one series of figures are the cause of the facte 
registered in the other series the morning chronicle 
produced two series of figures — the one showing the iur 
crease in the number of boys who attended the eagged 
schools — the other showing the increase in the number of 
juvenile culprits brought before the police magistrate 
it seems that within the same period of time both the 
series of numbers had increased it was therefore in 
feried that the establishment of the eagged schools had 
been the cause of an increase in the number of juvenile 
thieves in reply to this inference the christian times 
observes — as to the specific value of the statistical 
figures of the morning chronicle we conceive the utmost 
merit that can be allowed them is to consider them an 
other ingenious illustration of the frequent fallacy cum hoc 
propter hoc for more they can never pass since they 
have not a whit better claim to be regarded as proofe than 
the declaration of a country cousin of ours the other day 
who maintained that england had been falling ever since 
appledumplings on a sunday went out of feshion our 
contemporary might with equal truth have shown that 
the increase of juvenile delinquency had kept pace with 
the increase of railway traffic or with the sale of banbury 
cakes or the new discovery of apricot lozenges or with the 
use of the magnetic telegraph and there would have been 
this advantage in these comparisons — that they are facts 
many things have a coanstence and preserve a mxirvellous 
ratio in their increments and yet have not the remotest con 
nexion as cause and effect and this we are convinced is 
the predicament of the accidental coincrease of juvenile 
rogueries and bagged schools 

another case in which statistics have been found to be

beneficial effects of the pennj postage tet it cannot be 
denied that those calculations which were made to show 
that this measure would increase the revenue to the state 
hive not been realized so those calculations which were 
made a few years ago bj distinguished statidans as to the 
lowest price at which foreign com could be imported into 
england have not hitherto turned out to be correct 
perhaps in these cases our reasonings more than our 
calculations have been elacious we may by statistics 
establish the truth of general principles and as a general 
rule we may assume that the future will resemble the 
past but as the influence of general principles is liable 
to be counteracted by special circumstances we cannpt 
predict the ftiture without having also a previous know 
ledge of those special circumstances it is the business of 
statistics to calculate not to prophesy 

 the following are extracts from the address of the 
earl of harrowby to the statistical society of london at 
the annual meeting held march 

 it is important in all sciences to know what is to be expected 
from them — what they can do and what they camiot — and for 
this purpose it should be always kept in mind tnat a mere perusal 
of statistical truths gives no short no royal road to knowledge 
but is merely one of the aids to its acquisition eor instance 
submit to a man totally ignorant of medicine a table containing a 
number of facts recorded on a medical subject — and how many 
false conclusions will he draw from it he must know more 
than the number of deaths in the year or even the enumeration 
of the diseases before he dares to draw any conclusion as to the 
sanitary condition of the place he must know whether ide 
mics have prevailed in th year in question — whether war pesti 
lence or famine have swelled the usual numbers it must be 
remembered that it is only a class of facts it is not all the facts 
that can be tabulated and these are only materiab towards a 
conclusion requiring themselves a running commentary from the 
knowledge judgment and impartiality of either the man who 
supplies or the man who reads the tables — without which quali 
fication they not only do not give the whole facts of the case but 
absolutely mislead by an appearance of completeness which they 
do not possess 

if again we were to take tables with regard to criminals 
there is no man who without considerable knowledge of the 
legal history and more than the legal history of the country 
would not lie misled bv the inspection he would see perhaps

appucatiolf of reasoning to statistics 

a considerable increase in the criminality of the countiy btrt it 
is desirable to know what was included in the criminality at the 
beginning of the time and what is now included what changes 
have taken place in the laws how much is now submitted to the 
public observation which once was not whether crimes which 
once went under greater names and titles now wear liffhter ones 
and vice vertd whether the jurisdiction of one tribund has been 
transferred to another whether matters which formerly wctc 
submitted to the adjudication of a formal tribimal are now handed 
over to a summary jurisdiction if you come further to details 
they are of most essential importance in ascertaining the value of 
the tables for the purpose of ascertaining the real fact at issue 
which is the real increase or decrease of crime it is essential to 
know still more — you must take county by county in one case 
you have a rural police in another you have not in one case you 
have a much stricter and more rigorous enforcement of the law 
than in others i recollect on a former occasion i think at 
glasgow there were comparisons between the different amounts 
of drunkenness of different towns then came the question — 
what did the magistrates of one town hold to be druntenneis of 
a kind to be submitted to the law and what the magistrates of 
another town held to be such and rather an amusing test was 
submitted for drunkenness which would come within the law 
namely that as long as a man could walk on the curbstone with 
ut going off he was allowed to escape with impunity but if he 
could not keep on the curbstone he immediately was handed 
over to the proper tribunal 

now if we were to look at the statistics of circulation alone 
— the circulation of bank notes by itself — vve surely should be 
very illinformed as to the amount of means for promoting the 
excnange of commodities in actual operation and yet apparently 
the bank issues should be considered asuflficient test jsut if we 
look back to the amount of circulation at the beginning of the 
present century and see how little ik varies from the amount at 
the present moment and compare the amount of pecuniary trans 
actions in the one case ana in the other which have to be 
carried on apparently by that same means of exchange we should 
be extremely illinformed if we did not take into our considera 
tion the immense economy of exchange which has taken place by 
clearing houses and bills of exchange and every kind of mercwi 
tile facility which in fact makes the circulation which fifty 
years ago represented one amount of transactions to be a very 
imperfect test for purposes of comparison with the circulation of 
the present time

section v 

the application op the art op reasoning to moral 
philosophy 

moral philosophy has been defined by paley as the 
science that teaches men their duty and the reasons of it 
it is thus described by dr croly — 

 moral philosopby is the teaching of haman happiness in the 
hands of man as religion is the teaching of human nappiness in 
the hands of the creator it is the history of the rules unpulses 
and objects of human virtue it was the earliest of idi studies 
for the obvious reason that it was the most essential the first 
associations of nien must have felt the value of truth of a respect 
for property and of the avoidance of mutual injury thus we 
can expect no practical discoveries in morautj its prmciples being 
fixed by the primal necessities of our nature still though no 
practical difficulties exist in its rules their grounds their action 
and their objects abound in the most refinea problems the dis 
tinction of vice and virtue the supreme good the foundation of 
obedience the rights of man the origin of evil have exercised 
the subtlest inteuects since the days of the illustrious author of 
the proverbs a volume to which may be traced the greater por 
tion of all the eastern maxims the doctrines of the early sages 
known as the wise men of greece and perhaps the principles 
of the three great schools the platonic the stoic and tne epicu 
rean with the restoration of leaminff in europe the subject 
was resumed and has occupied powerful minds from the logical 
acuteness of hobbes and the profoimd learning of cudworth 
down to the dexterous simplicity but dubious conclusions of 
paley to be able to give a reason of the hope that is in us 
is a divine command next in importance is to be able to give 
to ourselves a reason for our duties but to give that reason 
requires the study of moral philosophy — jfatumal knowledge 
national tower 

in the application of logic to this science we may 
observe — 

 logic will teach us that there are moral truths 

 the first proposition which i assume and which i wish you 
to bear in your minds as firmly established is that there are 
moral truths so however it is i am solicitous that you shoidd 
from the very first constantly carry with you the firm conviction

and dr thomas brown dr cogans views seem grounded on 
the same views 

 dr adam smiths work on moral sentiments is the only one 
which is gronnded soldk on the principle of sympathy 

 dr rriestley and dr hartley are the only two writers wlio 
maintain that the association of ideas is the ground of good and 
tifil 

there are none of these different systems that are hot in 
some degree founded on truth but the great imperfection which 
tuns through them all is that they attempt to generalise too 
much we cannot resolve all the moral feelings and habits of 
our nature into one general principle — butkeys history of 
moral science 

 logic will teach us a proper mode of classification 
with regard to those actions or motives that are morally 
good or evil 

the division of virtue to which we are nowardays most 
accustomed is into duties — 

 towards god as piety reverence resignation gratitude c 

towards other men or relative duties as justice chmty 
loyal c 

 txwards ourselves as chastity sobriety temperance preser 
vation of life care of health c — faletfs moral fhuosophy 

the following is an enumeration of some of the duties 
of a pubhc company — 

the duties op public companies— the first of these 
duties is to obey the laws — a public company should abstain 
from smuggling and all other illicit proceedings — should make 
correct returns to government and pay its fair proportion of the 
propertytax and of all other duties render unto csesar the 
things which are caesars render to all their dues tribute to 
whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom 
fear honour to whom honour another duty is to enforce 
the laics upon others individuals sometimes abstain from pro 
secuting frauds upon themselves from a misapplied feeling of 
compassion an unwillingness to incur odium or the fear of 
expense but none of these feelings are sufficient to justify a 
public company in abstaining from this duty such a course is 
injurious to the public by holding out inducements to the com 
mission of similar crimes because sentence against an evil 
work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of 
men is fully set in them to dio evilf it is also the duty of public 
companies to support the cause of order and of due submission to

in living much within their means in order to provide for old

themselves against the use of ardent spirits not less than one in

more than reading books or what is called study you

you will meet with in books think on these before per

doing it and then ask what are the reasons for not doing

 to form a habit of reasoning rather divide your

try to be distinguished in your profession but do not 
be distinguished in anything else if so those engaged in 
the same profession will endeavour to detract from your 
professional reputation by praising you for other attain

and studies among a good many subjects rather than con

morals simply because he is accustomed to one kind of

no evidence that his capacity for moral reasoning has been 
impaired by his study of mathematics it appears to me 
 more rational to suppose that the discipline imparted to 
the mind by mathematical studies tends to give increased 
precision and energy to all the other operations in which 
it may engage at the same time in passing through

 to form a habit of reasoning you must keep your

one way of doing this is frequently to review all your 
opinions and examine the arguments by which they are 
supported and the objections to which they are exposed 
do not take your opinions in clusters upon the authority 
of the party or body to which you belong examine 
them one by one for yourself and be at all times prepared 
to render a reason for any doctrine that forms an article 
in either your political or your religious creed bead 
occasipnally those books or newspapers that contain 
attacks upon the sentiments you hold and think to your 
self what you would say in case you were called upon to 
reply to those attacks take a parliamentary speech for 
instance and fancy how you would reply to it in cases 
of actual contest attack the most able man of his party 
you pay yourself a poor compliment by selecting a weak 
opponent it is by wrestling with superior minds that 
we increase our own strength in logical disputation as

aid read a section at each of their meetings and every 
member might from his own reading occupation or pro

definitions have been founded on the circomstanoes by whidi he 
is chiefly distinaished from other animals 

bj some he is styled a rational animal— being endowed vith 
reason thongh several of the inferior animals sach as digs 
horses and elephants discover great sagacity in particular cirmm 
stanoes yet none seem to be endowed with that faculty whici we 
style reason — the power of reflecting— of comparing ideaof 
drawing inferences and of tracing consequences the indinct 
which tiiey possess is sufficient for the station which provicence 
has assignea to them in this lower world it rises at oice to 
maturity and is not like the reason of men developed b slow 
and imperceptible degrees while instinct thus rises rapidy to 
maturity it never surpasses a certain point eeason teens 
capable of an indefinite degree of improvement the arts aid 
sciences are progressive through succeeding generations — where 
one ends another begins but instinct maces no iroprovemeit 
a bird of the nineteenth century will build his nest in the sane 
way as a bird that lived two thousand years ago and build it to 
without any previous instruction and without having seen a me 
nest constructed 

man has been defined a religious animal no other animl 
that we are aware of has any sense of religion they have lo 
consciousness that they are mdebted for their existence to tie 
power of a superior wing— no sense of obligation to him — lo 
anticipation of their own death of course they have no assemble 
for religious worship— they perform no act of devotion — thd 
conduct cannot be influenced by a fear of punishment or a hop 
of reward in a future state of existence it is true they hav 
some dispositions which among mankind are deemed mori 
qualities they are more temperate than men thev posses 
attachment for their offispring and are free from that ambition ani 
avarice which are the great sources of human vices but thes 
dispositions being conferred by nature and not regulated by coh 
siderations of duty or propriety ought more propeny to betennd 
instincts than moral quahties 

man has been defined a political animal as men only are founl

hare no notion of the advantas to be derived from a division of 
labour each animal provides its own food makes its own nest 
and performs everythmg for itself nor do we find among them 
any class who devote themselves to the service of the community 
and who consequently are supported by the labour of others 
they have no lawyers no judges no magistrates to adjust their 
disputes no professors to impart knowledge no physicians to 
heal the sick there are a few cases in which animtds live in 
society such are the bees who live under a monarchy even in 
north america and even in trance and germany where the salic 
law is in force their monarch is alwas a female 

man has been defined a cooking ammal because he alone cooks 
his food before he eats it the bird eats the worm without either 
roasting or boiling it and all animals eat their food whether it 
be animal or vegetable in the state in which it is produced but 
nearly all the food of man first undergoes an artificial preparation 
fruits and salads are the chief things tie eats raw nor does man 
like the other animals confine his oeverage to the pure water of 
the spring but has recourse to infusions and distillations in order 
to render his drink more palatable or more potent 

man has been defined a toolmaking animal whatever other 
animals perform whether they collect their food or construd 
their haoitation they use only those instruments with which 
nature has endowed them but man looks about for tools and 
constructs machines by these means he increases his power and 
effects his objects better and more rapidly than he could other 
wise do 

man has been defined a pugnacious animal that is — he alone 
in contending against his enemies emjovs artificial weapons 
when the other animals fight they use only the weapons which 
nature has given them it is by their horns their teeth their 
daws or their poison that they assail their foes but man has 
put every part of nature under contribution to supply him with 
weapons of destruction he has depopulated forests and 
drawn iron from the mine and compelled chemistry to furnish 
materials by which he might more effectually destroy his fellow 
creatures — 

oh shame to man i 
devil with devil damnd firm concord holds • 

men only disagree of creatures rational 

this definition however is said to be not strictly correct as 
several tribes of monkeys are known to use sticks and branches 
of trees in contending against each other if however this dis 
tinction is not peculiar to man we have the consolation to reflect 
that it is not shared with us by any but monkeys

bat the definition of man which has the nearest relation to our 
present subject is that he is a talking animal no other animal 
 endowed with the faculty of speech 

a language is a collection of sounds employed by the people of 
any country to contcy their ideas to each other ihe word 
pmlosophy is derived from two greek words which mean the 
lotc of learning and in modem use is employed to denote the 
investigation of abstract principles the various branches or de 
partments of philosophy are usually called sciences a science 
is different from an art science consists in the investigation of 
causes and principles with a view to the discovery of general 
rules art consists in the application of those rules to practical 
purposes all art is founded on some science and most sciences 
teact to the practice of some useful art though the words science 
and philosophy may in point of meaning be considered as nearly 
synonymous both denoting the investigation of principles yet 
from custom the word science is limited to those branches 
human knowledge which have a reference to the properties of 
matter such as astronomy navigation and the di£ferent brandies 
of the mathematics while the term philosophy is applied to those 
branches of knowledge which have a reference to the faculties of 
the mind and to the various relations of human life thus we 
speak of the philosophy of tiie human mind of moral philosophy 
tne philosophy of history the philosophy of taste the phiiosophj 
of rhetoric and the philosophy of language 

philosophy as applied to language bears the same relation to 
rrammar as science does to art or as the business of an architect 
aoes to that of a mason the grammarian like the mason is 
governed by the estauished rules he requires that seutenoes 
should be constructed according to the acknowledged laws of the 
language tiie philosophy or the science of language investigates 
the propriety of these laws considers the circumstances in which 
they oiiginated and endeavours to ascertain whether in some 
cases more elegance and conveniice may not be obtioned bj a 
departure from them than by their rid observance 

in the prosecution of this subject shall in the present lecture 
consider tlie nature the origin and the iformation of language 

i the nature of language 

language is a collection of sounds expressive of ideas and em 
ployed as a means of intercourse among mankind the inferior 
animals have certain sounds by which they express their feelings 
many fishes indeed cannot utter any kind or sounds and many 
worms are in the same state but most birds and beasts have the 
power of uttering sounds if they feel pain they express the sen 
sation by a certain sound if they feel pleasure they express it

mi naxlpht ov lavckjaoe 

if another soond if exposed to danger too they employ axol li 
sound but tills is not laaeaae for men too express tl 
sensations by certain sounds distinct from words and even ni 
who are bom dumb will express the sensations of pain and plc 
surey fear and desire by certain natural sounds wholly diunc 
from articulate language but animals have a further power tlon 
this not only do they exprass sensations by peculiar sounds 
but they also employ certain sounds as a means of intercourse 
with each other a hen by a certain sound will inform her 
chickens tliat she has found some food for them to eat and they 
will all run to devour it by another sound she can inform them 
of the near approach of a hawk and they will all rush beneath her 
wings so also most animals appear to be acquainted with the 
voices of tlieir enemies when the lion roars the beasts of the 
forest will run to a place of shelter and a hare will hasten away 
when she hears the voice of a pack of itounds 

these sounds however which animali have the power of utter 
ing seem totally distinct from language and are analogous to 
those sounds which men can utter who are unable to speak an 
infant can express pain and pleasure by certain sounds even in its 
tenderest age ana long before it has learned the use of language 
it has acquired certain sounds of its own which it employs as a 
means of intercourse with those around 

these animal sounds differ from language in the first place in 
being natural and instinctive whereas language is always acquired 
if a dog were bred up apart from all other dogs it would never 
theless acquire the practice of barking and were there only one 
bird in the world that bird would sing these exercises would 
be as natural to them as it is natural for a child to cry but if a 
child were brought up by itself it would never learn to speal 
we know very well that when children are bom deaf they alwajrs 
remain dumb nay more even speech when once acquired is 
liable to be lost some of us i dare say have forgotten in a 
great degree languages which we understood pretty well when we 
were at school and selkirk whose solitarv residence in a desert 
island for four years gave rise to the popular novel of robinson 
crasoe had when taken away nearly lost the use of speech and 
pronounced his words very imperfectly if we wish to retain the 
knowledge of any languid it is indispensably necessary that we 
write and talk it frequently but animals retain the sounds by 
which they communictite with each other without any danger of 
losing them or of becoming unable to utter them distinctly the 
reason is that with them the sounds are natural while with us 
language is always acquiied 

another difference between these animal sounds and human 
language is that these sounds are expressive of sensations but 
language is expressive of ideas if i feel cold have a sensation 



y google 



 thl fhilpht of languaob 

of cold but if i think of odd without feeling it i have then an 
idea of cold animab feel external impressions like men and 
thej haye sounds to denote those feelings as sounds are expres 
siye of sensations it follows that thej are all similar for a similar 
sensation will produce a similar sound all dogs of the same 
species will bark alike all birds of the same species will sing 
alike but twenty men will express the same iaea in as many 
different ways thus if a man has a ye painful toothace he 
may sigh he may groan he may weep this is the expression of 
the sensation and all men expressing the same sensations might 
express it in the same way and by similar sounds but if he 
wished to communicate to some other person the idea that he had 
a yery painful toothache this idea might beconyeyed in as many 
different ways as there are lanages and even twenty people 
who spoke the same language might use different words to con 
yey this idea sensations are expressed by nearly similar sounds 
but the same ideas may be expressed by yarious sounds 

another difference lietween animal sounds and human language 
is that the bitter is capable of being subdivided into syllables 
animals are without articulation a word is not a continuous 
sound it is a succession of sounds gradually sliding into each 
other let any one keep his organs of speech in a fixed position 
and try how many sounds he can utter by the mere emission oi 
his breath and he will find that these sounds are exceedingly few 
in speaking the organs of speech are perpetually yarying their 
position and thus they form articulate language it is a remark 
able fact that while we can construct mecnanical instruments that 
shall emit sounds resembling the music of the birds we can form 
none that are capable of uttering words to this point our dia 
coyeries in mechanical science have not yet been carried and 
we have to look forward to future inventions when our harps and 
pianos shall accompany their music with uieir voices and the 
organs in our churches shall not only sound the tunes but also 
sing the psalms 

ii i now proceed to consider the origin of language 

it is very certain that infants do not speak as soon as they are 
bom and if bom deaf they do not learn to speak at all lan 
guage then is not essential to existence man may exist without 
unguage it has been a matter of much inquiry whether there 
was any period in the history of mankind wherein they were 
destitute of speech and if so in what way they became ac 
quainted with the use of langua 

some philosophers both ancient and modem have belieyed 
that mankind were originally savages destitute of any knowledge 
of the arts and sciences and even of the use of language and 
then by their own unassisted exertions they reached their sub 
sequent state of improvement— that language is entirely of humaa

inyention and that previons to its discovery the commumcation 
of ideas among manxind was carried on by signs and gestures 
hence we maj account for the yariety of languages that exists in 
the world on the snpposition that different branches of mankind 
fixed upon different sounds as the representatives of their ideas 

but the opinion that all mankind were originally savages is 
unsupported oy either reason or history had they been created 
savages they would probably have remained savages for ever 
they could have formed no idea of a civilization which had never 
existed nor have desired comforts the want of which they did 
not feel history does not record a single instance of a savage 
nation having become civilized by its own unassisted exertions 
civilization has never sprung up spontaneously om the soil it 
has always been imported from abroad the greeks derived 
their civilization from the egyptians the eomans theirs from 
the greeks the nations conquered by home became civilized 
from their intercourse with the eomans but if we attempt to 
trace the origin of civilization in egypt and babylon we are at a 
loss for neither history nor even tradition mentions any period 
at which these nations were not civilized founded soon after 
the flood they possessed the knowledge of all the arts and 
sciences known to the antediluvian world the fertility of 
their soils and the extent of their plams furnished ample pro 
tision for their population hence as population increased tneir 
civilization increased while on the other hand those tribes or 
families who wandered in quest of new settlements became sepa 
rated from the rest of mankind by mountains and forests and 
rivers and their time being whouy occupied in seeking supplies 
of food they lost in the course of a few generations the know 
ledge they originally possessed and fell into the savage state it 
would thus appear from history and from reason that the savage 
state was not the original state of man but a departure from that 
state arising from a want of communication through several ages 
with the other branches of the family of mankind 

but although in various places man has been found in a savage 
state he has never vet been found so far brutalized as to be desti 
tute of speech all tribes of savages however widely separated 
from each other in various parts of the world possess the know 
ledge of some articulate language among these savages then 
the invention of speech must have preceded their advance from 
the savage state ibut is it not ver unlikely that men who were in 
so rude a state as to be unable to invent the simplest implement 
of agricidture should invent a language even in our present 
state of civilization were we suddenly bereft of our language and 
of all recollection of it we should find sume difficulty in framing 
a new language for ourselves how then could a nation of 
savages be competent to effect such an object p besides in what

way prerions to the invention of language could a tribe of 
savages carrr on the discussions upon tbe proprietjf of inventing 
itp would it not be a curious siglit were we to see a hundred or 
a thousand or ten thousand savages discussing without language 
the propriety of inventing sueecn and of gxing upon the various 
sounds that might be suitable to their respective ideas can we 
imagine for a moment that either house of parliament could 
fiilly discuss without language the puinest matter connected 
with our national iuterests p aiid if not how could a nation of 
savages discuss without speaking so abstruse a subject as that of 
language 

if tlien language be not a numan invention it must have been 
oommunicated to man by some superior being when man was 
first created he must have been informed of the variety of sounds 
he was capable of uttering and instructed in the way in whidi 
these sounds might be employed to denote sensations and ideas 
the following account of the invention of the first language is 
given by moses — and out of the ground the lord god formed 
every beast of tlie field and every fowl of the air and brought 
them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatever 
adam called every living creature that was the name thereof 
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air 
and to every beast of the field 

here it is presupposed that man was orinally endowed with 
the faculty of speech and was at the same time rendered capable 
of applying certain sounds to denote certain objects and of 
remenibefriii the association which he had thus formed agree 
ably with this sentiment is the representatioii of milton in his 
paradise lost — 

 to tpeak i tried and forthwith tpale 

my tongae obeyd and readily could name 
whateer saw thou sun said i fair light 
and thou enlightend barth so fresh and gay 
ye hills and diales ye rivers woods and plains 
and ye that live and move fair creatures tell 
tell if ye saw how cune i thus how here 
not of myself by some great maker then 
in goodness and in power preeminent 
tell me how may i know him how adore 
prom whom i have that thus i move and live 
and feel that i am happier than i knaw 

iil we shall now consider the formation of language 

we contend then that man was originally taught tlie nature of 
speech and supematurally endowed with tlie power of forming a 
languase and we shall now inquire what are those faculties of 
the mind wliich are brought into exercise by the attempt to em 
ploy this power and what are the steps by which language would 
oe gradually formed these faculties we consider would be liven

as man at the first linoinent of his existence could have had no 
language it is evident that the first words he uttered must have 
been words of pure invention they could no have been 
borrowed from other languages or derived from other words 
because no other words or language had anj existence to exer 
cise this power of invention to an extent sufficient to form a 
lahguage it would be necessary that man should be capable of 
uttering a variety of sounds — that he should be able to assisn 
distinct sounds to denote distinct ideasand tliat he should be 
able to remember each sound which had thus been appropriated 
he would in the first place form words to denote those objects 
which were visible to his senses and by which he was immedi 
ately surrounded these words must originally have been vciy 
few his stoc of words could not be greater than his stock of 
ideas as his ideas increased his words would increase the 
three great classes of words in all languages are — the natnes of 
things the names of qualities and the names of actions man 
would begin his efforts at language by giving names to things 
the heavenly bodies the natural soenery around him the moun 
tains the hills the rivers the trees and the fields the birds 
beasts and other animals and the several objects with which he 
came in more immediate contact would be designated by appro 
priate sounds the qualities which are obvious to the senses 
would next be noticed and the different colours figures tastes 
and sounds would be named as soon as occasion presented them to 
his view and then he would name those actions which he himself 
performed or which he saw performed by the animals around him 

some hilologists have considered that man did not invent any 
part of his language but merely imitated the sounds issued by 
other animals or by parts of the material universe in support 
of this theory they have adduced some words which resemble the 
sounds they are employed to denote — such as roar crash whisper 
but these instances are too few to support a general theory the 
greater part of the objects of our ideas are those which do not 
emit sounds and to these the theory will not appljr besides this 
theory would import that man had neard all these various sounds 
before he had commenced to form words 

the faculty of invention however would very soon be assisted 
by the faculty of association it is not necessary to the present 
subject that i should enter into any metaphysical discussion of 
the principle of association it is sufficient for us to know that 
when two ideas have a resemblance to each other the occtirrence 
of one to the mind often brings in tlie other hence when the 
mind had by the power of invention appropriated a certain 
sound to denote a certain idea if another idea occurred resem 
bling the former the association would lead to the formation of a 
sound that resembled the former sound so if we entertained

an idea fonned of two ideas each of which had its lespeetive 
name we should bj the power of association call the compounded 
idea b a word formed of the names of the two single ideas 
thus if we had formed an idea of a horse and an idea of the sea 
and had afterwards seen in the sea an anunal resembling a horse 
we should naturally call it a seahorse hence in all mdguages 
have arisen compounded words in some of which the parts have 
been so blended that the piimitiyes of which tbe are composed 
cannot be ascertained but bj the labour of philologists 

there are numerous other ways in which the names of thinp 
would by association give rise to the names of other things the 
names of trades and professions for instance are generallv deriyed 
from the names of the commodities employed in carrying tnem on 

nouns too are often derived from verbs these nouns denote 
the agent and the subject of the action the agent in our 
language is denoted very often by addin r or to the verb as 
love lover our luiguage is dencient in not having words to 
denote the subject upon which the verb operates thus we have 
no word to denote the person who is lovea we have only a few 
legal correlative terms of this sort as payer payee— drawee 
drawee— mortgager mortgagee 

by association too words denoting thmgs would nve rise to 
words denoting qualities thus if a nouse were made of wood 
it would be verr natural to call it a wooden house and in this 
way there are in all languages numerous classes of adjective 
formed by changing the termination of the substantives al 
though in our own umguage we often use the substantive as an 
adjective without changing its termination as a gold chain a 
silver watch jret in many others we change the termination or 
make an addition to it as a sandy soil a mountainous country 
atfruitful tree some writers have contended tliat in this way 
were formed all our adjectives denoting colours and other simple 
sensations thus when we say a chestnut horse the word 
chestnut is employed as the name of a colour so also are the 
words orange violet indigo 

names h qualities are not only derived from the names of 
things but also from names of actions thus we have a class of 
adjectives ending in able which were formed by associating the 
idea of capability with the ideas of the verbs such are eatable 
marketable teachable 

mankind would soon perceive that actions have qualities similar 
to thoe which are ascnbed to thines and hence the namej of 
the qualities of things would be employed with some little change 
to express the qualities of actions hence from adjectives which 
are the names of the qualities of things would be formed adverbs 
which are the names of the qualities of actions the ideas being 
associated in the mind the words would by that association be

broiijght to resemble each other in our langoage adverbs of 
quality are often formed from adjectives by the addition of 
as wise wisely beantifid beautimlly cruel cruelly 

the faculty of association is not employed merely in the forma 
tion of new words but it leads also to the application of old 
words to new ideas sometimes the material ot which anything 
was formed was employed to denote the thing itself as a stick a 
horn a stone the name of one object was also applied to some 
other to which it seemed to bear a resemblance thus the word 
branch which denotes a part of a tree is applied to a part of 
almost every object that is capable of division hence we speak 
of the branch of a road the branch of a river the branch of a 
family the branch of a discourse 

words which were originally employed to denote sensible 
objects were afterwards applied to intellectual ideas the last 
object to which man directs nis attention and that which he fiends 
the most difficult to comprehend are the powers of his own mind 
hence mankind have usually a large stock of words denoting 
sensible ideas before they think of naming those ideas which are 
intellectual and the operations of the mind can scarcelv be 
understood but by comparison with external objects mankind 
therefore having found or fancied some resemblance between 
sensible and intellectual ideas applied the same words to both 
in all languages we find that words denoting intellectual ideas 
when traced to their origin are taken from sensible objects and 
were at first metaphors the words understanding evidence 
reflection as well as the words i have employed to denote the 
faculties of invention association and abstraction are all taken 
from objects of sense these words have now lost their meta 
phorical meaning and have become literal through bein so fre 
quently used so we still speak of a man beins bummg with 
zeal inflamed with anger swollen with rage and inflated with 
pride and by the same figure of speech we talk of a man having 
a hard heart or a soft heart a tnick head or a long head a 
fertile imagination a sound judgment a strong memory polished 
manners and when we recommend circumspection to an in 
dividual we tell him to look sharp 

by the same principle of association we apply to inanimate 
objects words denoting ideas peculiar to animals thus we speak 
of the head of a river the face of a country a neck of land and 
an arm of the sea of a running stream and a standing pool we 
say the ground thirsts for rain the earth smiles with plenty and 
 we speak of a learned age a happy period and a melancholy 
disaster 

it may be observed that in order to form an association between 
any two ideas in the mind it is by no means necessary that there 
should be any resembhmce between the ideas themselves the

mind is exceedingly capricioafl in its associations and this caprice 
 abundantlj evident m the formation of language in former 
times jono women employed a good deal of toeir time in spin 
ning the idea of spinnmg became associated with the idea of a 
young woman and to this day an unmarried lady is called a 
spinster it was also nsual to keep footboys who were generally 
styled jack as a sailor is styled jack in the present day one 
part of the duty of a footboy was to pull off nis masters jboots 
but in the progress of society an instrument was invented by 
which the master could take off his own boots and this instru 
ment was called a jack another part of the business of a foot 
boy was to turn the spit but here too manual labour was 
superseded by machinery an instrument was invented by which 
a piece of meat could be roasted without the assistance of jack 
but his name was retained and the new instrument was called a 
jack mr arkwright called some parts of his cotton machinery 
spinning jennies the words jack and jenny therefore awaken 
yery different ideas from those to which they were first applied 
 the power of association may from one word form a variety of 
others and although all the derivations may bear some resem 
bhmce to the primitive word yet they may have meanings widely 
different from each other thus the word et means to acquire 
but it is used in a yariety of senses a man may get hungry or 
he may get wet he may get a wager or he may get a cold he 
may get money or he may get drunk by associating the word 
get with particles the number of meanings is still farther in 
creased we may get in or get out we may get off or get on we 
may get un or get down we may get through or get along eadi 
of these plirases has again a variety of meanings when we say 
a man has got off we may mean that he has alighted from hu 
horse or that he has escajped being hanged but in all these 
yarious mengs the primitive idea is retained though the deri 
yatiyes differ so widely i might illustrate this observation by 
numerous other words of the same kind 

having considered the faculties of inventicm and association i 
will now make a few observations upon the faculty of abstraction 
to abstract means to drawrom to withdraw i may see a white 
hat a white horse a white wall now if i think of a white 
colour without thinking of the hat or the horse or the wall i 
have then an abstract idea of white which i may call whiteness 
now this is called an abstract idea because it is drawn from some 
other idea with which it is naturally associated it is impossible 
for the colour white to exist by itself there must be some object 
that is white but in the mind we draw it from this object 
and lience it is an abstract idea in our language the names of 
many of these ideas end in neit as whiteness blackness sweet 
ness thiduiess these are abstract sensible ideas derived from

iieiisible ideas bat there ate also abstract moral and intellectnal 
ideas many of these are denoted bj words ending in ity and ce 
and are chiefly of latin derivation— as frugality hospitality dili 
gence prudence 

the faculty of abstraction not only gives rise to words denoting 
abstract qualities but also to words denoting abstract actions 
lese are chiefly nouns and participles there is a large class of 
nouns ending in itm which are derived from latin verbs and 
which denote the abstract action of those verbs such are pro 
dnction destruction persuasion vision motion c some of 
these nouns are used not only in the sense of abstract actions but 
also to denote the effect of the action thus when we say that 
country is remarkable for the production of com we use the word 
production in the sense of abstract action and might supply its 
place by the present participle producing but when we say corn 
 the chief production of that country it is used as thename for 
ttie thingj produced and we could not supply its place by the pre 
sent participle these two different senses oi the word are in some 
instances expressed by two different words thus the abstract 
action of the word create is denoted by the word creation and the 
thing created is called a creature so the word edifjr means to 
build up edification denotes the abstract action of building and 
the thing built is called an edifice so imagine imagination image 

the words formed by abstraction become more numerous as 
society becomes more intellectual association belongs to poetry 
abstraction to philosophy a poetic imagination grasps at resem 
uanoes and hence brings together ideas that seemed at first to 
liave no connexion it ves life and animation to every thing 
beneath its touch its vivid conceptions cannot be expressed in 
ordinary language new words are formed by combination or 
words previously formed are applied in new and bold significa 
tions jbut when mankind begin to study mental philosophy when 
they begin to investigate causes to trace consequences and to 
disouss theories then arise words of abstraction it becomes 
necessary to form words that shall express ideas and relations 
remote from common observation precision of conception becomes 
necessary and to assist precision of conception it is necessary to 
have recision of language an idea that is to be the subject of 
investigation must be detached from all other ideas with which it 
may be found in combination and viewed entirely alone hence 
arises the necessity of words of abstraction tbus it is to inven 
tion association and abstraction that we are indebted for the for 
mation of language 

while there is nothing more important there is nothing more 
mysterious than language how is it that by a single act of 
volition i can form sounds denoting the ideas that may exist in 
my mind p— that these sounds are carried by the atmosphere to

the ears of m auditors and awaken in their minds the same 
ideas which exist in my own p to explain in what mysterious 
manner this is effected is beyond the power of oar philosophy it 
is one of the secrets of nature known only to him who formed the 
ear and created the mind of man 

one great advantage which man has over the other animals 
consists in the power of cooperation it is b this means that 
the whole community is benefited hj the exertions of each indi 
vidual this power of cooperation conld not exist unless man 
kind possessed a prompt and perfect mode of communicating their 
ideas to each other and this ready communication exists only 
by means of langua lanage too is not merely a channel of 
thought it is a vehicle of fecsngs and by it we are able to impart 
our sentiments in such a way as to impress our emotions on the 
minds of our auditors by language men are aroused into indig 
nation or softened into svmpatny without language we could 
not be enlightened with the mstructions of science or enraptured 
with the buties of poetry to this we owe all the pleasures of 
our public assemblies and all the luxuries of social intercourse it 
is from this we derive all the happiness we receive from the specu 
lations of philosophy the brilliancy of wit the thunders oi do 
quence and themelody of song 

by the power of laipiage we are enabled to be useful to others 
we can instruct the ignorant caution the unwaiy or console the 
afliicted of what use is the intense application of the student 
the conceptions of the poet or the contemplations of the philo 
sopher if the result of tneir labours is known only to themselves 
thoughts valuable as gold in the mine are of no use to others 
until coined into words and bv imparting information to others 
our own faculties are improved our intellectual weapons are 
kept polished by use knowledge shut up in the mind of its 
possessor is like a stagnant pool useful to none but when 
allowed to flow out freely in the channels of languase it becomes 
a living fountain the streams of which carry health and beauty 
and fertility into every district through which they roll

the history and principles of banking 

third edition price i 

combining a clear appreciation of the science of banking with the best 
practical knowledge of his business we have seen no work on the subject which 
better deserves to be consulted and studied than mr gilharts volume — literary 
gazette 

 mr gilbart claims for his book that it is a scientific work written by a 
practical man his claims appear to be fully borne out by the perspicuity of his 
views and the analytical spirit in which he treats the subject he is fully master 
of the details and ascends with equal ease to the examination of the elementary 
principles — a has

new edition price s bd 

•• thousands of young men who have not had the opportunity of consulting the 
writers of greece and rome will find a variety of curious facts recorded in these 
pages which cannot fail to afford amusement to those who seek no higher 
gratification while those who desire to be instructed will find the philosophy of 
the comments on past transactions well adapted to discipline and enlarge their 
reflective faculties the style of mr gilbart is pure and simple but there are 
many indications of his capacity to rise to the elevation of the lohiest elo 
quence — douglas jerrolds weekly newspaper now the weekly news 

mr gilbart has evidently studied his subject he writes forcibly and well 
and has collected together a mass of useful information well digested and lucidly 
arranged the preface contains this suggestion namely that public lectureships 
should be established by the government in any general system of nationa 
education we do not believe that such a system would be found to operate 
beneficially but if we could be assured that all the lectures would be as meri 
t orious as those now before us then our objection to a great extent would be 
removed — morning post 

 we must testify our very high admiration of this work as a piece of author 
ship it is very superior clearly strongly convincingly written abounding in 
valuable facts and just principles and pervaded by a fine spirit of generous 
hilanthropy it were well to have such lectures as these delivered m every 
part of the and— british banner

logic of dr watts price s 
 this if as good a shillings worth of instruiniye reading as one can easfly 
meet with the work is not an abridgment but consists of selections from dr 
wattss logic given for the most part in his own words and so as to present a 
complete system though in a brief and condensed form dr wattss faculty 
for communicating instruction to the you g has rarely been equalled of hit 
original work mr gilbart remarks the logic of dr watts was not only 
received into both our universities but for above a century was a great favotirite 
with the public no other work on the subject ever obtained so extensive a cir 
culation mr gilbart has shown himself in bis own works well qualified for 
the office of a public instructor but we think he has done wisely and well in 
drawing on these old and neglected treasures it is pleasant to see the venerable 
doctor thus enabled to resume his labours among the youth of a new generation 
we wish him a hearty welcome in his new dress and cordially commend this 
clear and brief compendium to instructors of youth— paro april
