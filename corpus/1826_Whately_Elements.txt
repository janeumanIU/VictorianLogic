my dear mk provost

to enumerate the advantages i have derived from
your instructions both in regular lectures and in private
conversation would be needless to those acquainted with

the parties and to the public uninteresting my object

at present is simply to acknowledge how greatly i am
indebted to you in respect of the present work not
merely as having originally imparted to me the principles
of the science but also as having contributed remarks
explanations and illustrations relative to the most impor
tant points to so great an amount that i can hardly con
sider myself as more than half the author of such portions
of the treatise as are not borrowed from former publica
tions i could have wished indeed to acknowledge this
more explicitly by marking with some note of distinction
those parts which are least my own but i found it could
not be done in most instances there is something be
a

dedication

longing to each of us and even in those parts

where your

share is the largest it would not be fair that you should
be made responsible for anything that is not entirely your
own nor is it possible in the case of a science to re
member distinctly how far one has been in each instance
indebted to the suggestions of another information as
to matters of fact may easily be referred in the mind to
the person from whom we have derived it but scientific
truths when thoroughly embraced become much more a

part of the mind as it were since they rest not on the
authority of the instructor but on reasoning from data
which we ourselves furnish they are scions engrafted on
the stems previously rooted in our own soil and we are

apt to confound them with its indigenous productions
you yourself also i have reason to believe have for
gotten the greater part of the assistance you have afforded
in the course of conversations on the

subject as i have

found more than once that ideas which i distinctly re

membered to have received from you have not been recog
nized by you when read or repeated as far however as

i can recollect though there is no part of the following
pages in which i have not more or less received valuable

suggestions from you i believe you have contributed less
to the analytical outline and to the treatise on fallacies

and more to the subjoined dissertation than to the rest of
the work

dedication

v

i take this opportunity of publicly declaring that as
on the one hand you are not responsible for anything con
tained in this work so on the other hand should you
ever favour the world with a publication of your own on
the subject the coincidence which will doubtless be found

in it with many things here brought forward as my own
is not to be regarded as any indication of plagiarism at
least on your side
believe me to be

the following treatise contains the substance of
the article √¢Äúlogic√¢Äù in the encyclop√£¶dia metro
politana it was suggested to me that a separate
publication of it might prove acceptable not only
to some who are not subscribers to that treatise

but also to several who are but who for conveni

ence of reference would prefer a more portable
volume

i have accordingly revised it and made such ad
ditions chiefly in the form of notes as i thought
likely to increase its utility
i have taken without scruple whatever appeared

most valuable from the works of former writers
especially the concise but in general accurate trea
tise of aldrich but while i acknowledge my obli
gations to my predecessors of whose labours i have
largely availed myself i do not profess to be alto
gether satisfied with any of the treatises that have
yet appeared nor have i accordingly judged it any
unreasonable presumption to point out what seem

viii

preface

to me the errors they contain indeed whatever
deference an author may profess for the authority
of those who have preceded him the very circum
stance of his publishing a work on the same sub
ject proves that he thinks theirs open to improve
ment in censuring however as i have had occa
sion to do several of the doctrines and explanations

of logical writers and of aldrich in particular i
wish it to be understood that this is not from my
having formed a low estimate of the merits
of the compendium drawn up by the author

just mentioned but on the contrary from its de
served popularityfrom the impossibility of no
ticing particularly all the points in which we agree
√¢Äîand from the consideration that errors are the

more carefully to be pointed out in proportion to

the authority by which they are sanctioned
i have also to acknowledge assistance received from
several friends who have at various times suggested
remarks and alterations but i cannot avoid par

ticularizing the rev j newman fellow of oriel
college who actually composed a considerable
portion of the work as it now stands from manu

scripts not designed for publication and who is the
original author of several pages some valuable
illustrations of the importance of attending to the
ambiguity of the terms used in politicaleconomy

have been furnished by the kindness of my friend
and former pupil mr senior of magdalen college
and of lincolns inn now professor of political
economy at oxford they are printed in the ap
pendix but the friend to whom it is inscribed
has contributed far more and that in the most

important parts than all others together so much
indeed that though there is in the treatise nothing
of his which has not undergone such expansion or
modification as leaves me solely responsible for the
whole there is not a little of which i cannot fairly
claim to be the author

on the utility of logic many writers have said
much in which i cannot coincide and which has

tended to bring the study into unmerited disrepute
by representing logic as furnishing the sole instru
ment for the discovery of truth in all subjects and

as teaching the use of the intellectual faculties in
general they raised expectations which could not
be realized and which naturally led to a reaction
the whole system whose unfounded pretensions had
been thus blazoned forth has come to be commonly

regarded as utterly futile and empty like several of
our most valuable medicines which when first

introduced were proclaimed each as a panacea
infallible in the most opposite disorders and which

consequently in many instances fell for a time into

x

preface

total disuse though after a long interval they were
established in their just estimation and employed
conformably to their real properties
to explain fully the utility of logic is what can
be done only in the course of an explanation of the
system itself one preliminary observation only

for the original suggestion of which i am indebted
to the same friend to whom this work is inscribed
it may be worth while to offer in this place if it
were inquired what is to be regarded as the most
appropriate intellectual occupation of man as
man what would be the answer the statesman is

engaged with political affairs the soldier with
military the mathematician with the properties
of numbers and magnitudes the merchant with
commercial concerns c but in what are all and

each of these employed evidently in reasoning
they are all occupied in deducing well or ill con
clusions from premises each concerning the
subject of his own particular business if there
fore it be found that the process going on daily in
each of so many different minds is in any respect
the same and if the principles on which it is con
ducted can be reduced to a regular system and if
rules can be deduced from that system for the bet
ter conducting of the process then it can hardly be
denied that such a system and such rules must be

preface

xi

especially worthy the attention not of the members

of this or that profession merely but of every one
who is desirous of possessing a cultivated mind
to understand the theory of that which is the ap
propriate intellectual occupation of man in general
and to learn to do that well which every one will
and must do whether well or ill may surely be
considered as an essential part of a liberal education

even supposing that no practical improvement

in argumentation resulted from the study of logic
it would not by any means follow that it is un
worthy of attention the pursuit of knowledge on
curious and interesting subjects for its own sake is
usually reckoned no misemployment of time and is
considered as incidentally if not directly useful to
the individual by the exercise thus afforded to the
mental faculties all who study mathematics are
not training themselves to become surveyors or
mechanics some knowledge of anatomy and che
mistry is even expected in a man liberally educated

though without any view to his practising surgery
or medicine the investigation of a process
which is peculiarly and universally the occupation
of man considered as man can hardly be reckoned
a less philosophical pursuit than those just in
stanced

it has usually been assumed however in the case

xii

preface

of the present subject that a theory which does not
tend to the improvement of practice is utterly
unworthy of regard and then it is contended that
logic has no such tendency on the plea that men
may and do reason correctly without it an objec
tion which would equally apply in the case of
grammar music chemistry mechanics c in
all of which systems the practice must have existed
previously to the theory but many who allow the

use of systematic principles in other things are ac
customed to cry up commonsense as the sufficient
and only safe guide in reasoning now by com
monsense is meant i apprehend when the term is

used with any distinct meaning an exercise of the
judgment unaided by any art or system of rules 
such as we must necessarily employ in numberless
cases of daily occurrence in which having no es

tablished principles to guide us no line of proce
dure as it were distinctly chalked out we must
needs act on the best extemporaneous conjectures
we can form he who is eminently skilful in
doing this is said to possess a superior degree of
commonsense but that commonsense is only

our secondbest guide√¢Äîthat the rules of art if judi
ciously framed are always desirable when they
can be had is an assertion for the truth of which

i may appeal to the testimony of mankind in

preface

xiii

general which is so much the more valuable in
asmuch as it may be accounted the testimony of
adversaries for the generality have a strong predi
lection in favour of commonsense except in those
points in which they respectively possess the
knowledge of a system of rules but in these points
they deride any one who trusts to unaided common
sense a sailor eg will perhaps despise the
pretensions of medical men and prefer treating a

disease by commonsense but he would ridicule
the proposal of navigating a ship by common
sense without regard to the maxims of nautical
art a physician again will perhaps contemn

systems of politicaleconomy of logic or me
taphysics and insist on the superior wisdom of
trusting to commonsense in such matters but
he would never approve of trusting to common
sense in the treatment of diseases neither again
would the architect

recommond a reliance on com

monsense alone in building nor the musician in
music to the neglect of those systems of rules
which in their respective arts have been deduced

from scientific reasoning aided by experience

and the induction might be extended to every de
partment of practice since therefore each gives
the preference to unassisted commonsense only in

those cases where he himself has nothing else to

xiv

preface

trust to and invariably resorts to the rules of art
wherever he possesses the knowledge of them it is

plain that mankind universally bear their testimony
though unconsciously and often unwillingly to the

preferableness of systematic knowledge to conjectu
ral judgments
it was doubtless from a strong and deliberate con
viction of the advantages direct and indirect accru
ing from an acquaintance with logic that the uni


versity of oxford when remodelling their system

not only retained that branch of study regardless
of the clamours of many of the halflearned but
even assigned a prominent place to it by making it
an indispensable part of the examination for the
first degree this last circumstance however i
am convinced has in a great degree produced an

effect opposite to what was designed it has contri
buted to lower instead of exalting the estimation of
the study and to withhold from it the earnest at

tention of many who might have applied to it with
profit

i am not so weak as to imagine that any

system can ensure great proficiency in any pursuit
whatever either in all students or in a very large
proportion of them √¢Äúwe sow many seeds to
obtain a few flowers√¢Äù but it might have been ex

pected and doubtless was expected that a majority
at least of successful candidates would derive some

preface

benefit worth mentioning from their logical pur
suits and that a considerable proportion of the dis
tinguished candidates would prove respectable if

not eminent logicians such expectations i do not
censure as unreasonable or such as i might not

have formed myself had i been called upon to judge
at that period when our experience was all to come

but that experience has shown that those expecta
tions have been very inadequately realized the
truth is that a very small proportion even of dis
tinguished students ever become good logicians

and that by far the greater part pass through the
university without knowing any thing at all of it

i do not mean that they have not learned by rote a

string of technical terms but that they understand
absolutely nothing whatever of the principles of the
science i am aware that some injudicious friends
of oxford will censure the frankness of this avowal

i have only to reply that such is the truth and that
i think too well of and know far too well the

university in which i have been employed in various
academical occupations above eighteen years to

apprehend danger to her reputation from declaring
the exact truth

with all its defects and no

human institution is perfect the university would

stand i am convinced higher in public estimation

than it does were the whole truth and nothing but

xvi

prfface

the truth in all points respecting it more fully
known but the scanty and partial success of the
measures employed to promote logical studies is
the consequence i apprehend of the universality
of the requisition that which must be done by

every one will of course often be done very indiffe
rently and when the belief is once fully established
which it certainly is that anything which is indis

pensable to a testimonial has little or nothing to
do with the attainment of honours the lowest stan
dard soon becomes the established one in the minds

of the greater part and provided that standard be
once reached so as to secure the candidate from

rejection a greater or less proficiency in any such
branch of study is regarded as a matter of indiffer
ence as far as any views of academical distinction
are concerned divinity is one of these branches
and to this also most of what has been said con

cerning logic might be considered as equally appli
cable but in fact there are several important differ
ences between the two cases in the first place

most of the students who are designed for the
church and many who are not have a value for

theological knowledge independently of the requi
sition of the schools and on that ground do not
confine their views to the lowest admissible degree

of proficiency whereas this can be said of very few

preface

xvii

in the case of logic but a consideration which is
still more to the present purpose is that theology
not being a science admits of infinite degrees of pro
ficiency from that which is within the reach of a
child up to the highest that is attainable by the most

exalted genius every one of which degrees is ines
timably valuable as far as it goes if any one under
stands tolerably the churchcatechism or even the
half of it he knows something of divinity and that
something is incalculably preferable to nothing
but it is not so with a science one who does not

understand the principles of euclids demonstrations
whatever number of questions and answers he may

have learnt by rote knows absolutely nothing of
geometry unless he attain this point all his labour
is utterly lost worse than lost perhaps if he is led

to believe that he has learnt something of a science
when in truth he has not

and the same is the

case with logic or any other science it does not
admit of such various degrees as a knowledge of

religion of course i am far from supposing that
all who understand anything at all of logic stand

on the same level but i mean what is surely un
deniable that one who does not embrace the fun

damental principles of that or any other science
whatever he may have taken on authority and
learned by rote knows properly speaking nothing
b

xviii

preface

of that science and such i have no hesitation in
saying is the case with a considerable proportion
even of those candidates who obtain testimonials

including many who gain distinction there are
some persons probably not above one in ten of
such as have in other respects tolerable abilities
who are physically incapable of the degree of steady
abstraction requisite for really embracing the prin
ciples of logic or of any other science whatever
pains may be taken by themselves or their teachers
but there is a much greater number to whom this
is a great difficulty though not an impossibility
and who having of course a strong disinclination
to such a study look naturally to the very lowest
admissible standard and the example of such
examinations in logic as must be expected in the

case of men of these descriptions tends in combi
nation with popular prejudice to degrade the study
altogether in the minds of the greater part it was
from these considerations perhaps that it was pro

posed not long since to leave the study of logic
altogether to the option of the candidates but the
suggestion was rejected the majority appearing to
think in which opinion i most fully coincide that
so strongly as the tide of popular opinion sets against
the study the result would have been within a few
years an almost universal neglect of that science

preface

xix

matters were left accordingly in respect of this
point on their former footing which i am con
vinced is far preferable to the proposed alteration
but there is a middle course between these two

which i am persuaded would be infinitely preferable
to either a persuasion which i have long enter
tained and which is confirmed by every days obser
vations and reflections of which few i believe have

bestowed more on this subject let the study of
logic be made optional to those who are merely can
didates for a degree but indispensable to the attain
ment of academical honours and i am ready to pledge
myself that it would speedily begin and progres
sively continue to rise in estimation and to be stu
died with real profit the examination might then
without any hardship be made a strict one since

no one could complain that a certain moderate
degree of scientific ability and a resolution to apply
to a certain prescribed study should be the condi

tions of obtaining distinction the far greater part
would still study logic since there would be as
now but few who would be willing to exclude
themselves from the possibility of obtaining distinc
tion but it would be studied with a very different
mind when ennobled as it were by being made
part of the passport to universityhonours and
when a proficiency in it came to be regarded gene
b

preface

rally as an honourable distinction and in propor
tion as the number increased of those who really
understood the science the number would increase
of such as would value it on higher and better

grounds it would in time come to be better known
and better appreciated by all the wellinformed part
of society these effects could not indeed be ex
pected to show themselves fully till after a consi
derable lapse of time but that the change would
begin to appear and that very decidedly within
three or four years i am perfectly confident my
earnest wishes for so important yet so easy and
simple an alteration are not unaccompanied with

sanguine hopes that before long it may take place
from the candid and judicious readiness which has
been shown to introduce from time to time such

improvements as careful inquiry and sound reason
ing suggest

i am sensible that many may object that this is
not the proper place for such remarks as the fore
going what has the public at large they may say
to do with the statutes of the university of oxford
to this it might fairly be replied that not only all

who think of sending their sons or other near rela
tives to oxford but all likewise who are placed
under the ministry of such as have been educated

there are indirectly concerned to a certain degree

preface

xxi

in the system there pursued but the consideration
which had the chief share in inducing me to say what
i have is that the vindication of logic from the
prevailing disregard and contempt under which it
labours would have been altogether incomplete
without it

for let it be remembered that the

science is judged of by the public in this country
in a very great degree from the specimens displayed
and the reports made by those whom oxford sends
forth every one on looking into the university
calendar or statute book feels himself justified in

assuming that whoever has graduated at oxford
must be a logician not indeed necessarily a first
rate logician but such as to satisfy the public exa
miners that he has a competent knowledge of the
science now if a very large proportion of these
persons neither are nor think themselves at all
benefited by their so called logical education and

if many of them treat the study with contempt and
represent it as a mere tissue of obsolete and empty

jargon which it is a mere waste of time to attend to
let any one judge what conclusions respecting the
utility of the study and the wisdom of the uni
versity in upholding it are likely to be the result

that prejudices so deeplyrooted as those i have
alluded to and supported by the authority of such
eminent names especially that of locke and as is

xxii

preface

commonly though not very correctly supposed
bacon should be overthrown at once by the present
treatise i am not so sanguine as to expect but if

i have been successful in refuting some of the most

popular objections and explaining some principles
which are in general illunderstood it may be hoped
that in time just notions on the subject may gain
ground especially if as i have some reason to
hope a more able advocate of the same cause should
be induced to step forward

it may be permitted me to mention that as i have
addressed myself to various classes of students from
the most uninstructed tyro to the furthestadvanced

logician and have touched accordingly both on the

most elementary principles and on some of the
most remote deductions from them it must be ex

pected that readers of each class will find some parts
not wellcalculated for them

some explanations

will appear to the one too simple and puerile and
for another class some of the disquisitions will be
at first too abstruse if to each description some

portions are found interesting it is as much as i
can expect

with regard to the style i have considered

perspicuily not only as it always must be the
first point but as one of such paramount import
ance in such a subject as to justify the neglect of

preface

xxiii

all others prolixity of explanationhomeliness
in illustrationand baldness of expression i have

regarded as blemishes not worth thinking of when
anything was to be gained in respect of clearness
of the correctness of the fundamental doctrines

maintained in the work i may be allowed to feel
some confidence not so much from the length of
time about fourteen years that i have been more
or less occupied with it enjoying at the same time
the advantage of frequent suggestions and correc
tions from several judicious friends as from the
nature of the subject in works of taste an author
cannot be sure that the judgment of the public will
coincide with his own and if he fail to give plea

sure he fails of his sole or most appropriate object
but in the case of truths which admit of scientific

demonstration it is possible to arrive by reasoning
at as full an assurance of the justness of the conclu
sions established as the imperfection of the human

faculties will admit and experience accompanied
with attentive observation and with repeated trials

of various methods may enable one long accustomed

to tuition to ascertain with considerable certainty
what explanations are the best comprehended

many parts of the detail however may probably
be open to objections but if no errors are disco

vered which materially affect the substantial utility

xxiv

preface

of the work but only such as detract from the
credit of the author the object will have been at
tained which i ought to have had principally in view

no credit i am aware is given to an authors
own disclaimer of personal motives and profession

of exclusive regard for public utility since even
sincerity cannot on this point secure him from de

ceiving himself but it may be allowable to observe
that one whose object is the increase of his reputa
tion as a writer can hardly choose a subject less

suitable for his purpose than the present it is far
from a popular one and not likely to become so in
any considerable degree at least during the life

time of a writer of the present day ignorance
fortified by prejudice opposes its reception even in
the minds of those who are considered as both can

did and wellinformed

besides that a great ma

jority of readers not only know not what logic is
but have no curiosity to learn the greater part of
those who imagine that they do know are wedded
to erroneous notions of it

the multitude never

think of paying any attention to the correctness of 
their reasoning and those who do are usually too
confident that they are already completely successful
in this point to endure the thought of seeking
instruction upon it

and as on the one hand a large class of modern

preface

xxv√¢Äô

philosophers may be expected to raise a clamour
against √¢Äúobsolete prejudices√¢Äù √¢Äúbigoted devotion
to the decrees of aristotle√¢Äù √¢Äúconfining the human
mind in the trammels of the schoolmen√¢Äù c so

on the other hand all such as really are thus bigot
ed to everything that has been long established

for that reason alone will be ready to exclaim
against the presumption of an author who presumes
to depart in several points from the track of his pre
decessors



there is another circumstance also which tends
materially to diminish the credit of a writer on this
and some other kindred subjects we can make
no discoveries of striking novelties the senses of
our readers are not struck as with the return of a
comet which had been foretold or the extinction

of a taper in carbonicacid gas the materials we
work

upon are

common and familiar to all and

therefore supposed to be well understood by all 
and not only is any ones deficiency in the use of
these materials such as is generally unfelt by him
self but when it is removed by satisfactory expla
nations√¢Äîwhen the notions which had been per

plexed and entangled are cleared up by the introduc
tion of a few simple and apparently obvious prin

ciples he will generally forget that any explana
tion at all was needed and consider all that has

xxvi

preface

been said as mere truisms which even a child could

supply to himself such is the nature of the fun
damental principles of a science√¢Äîthey are so fully
implied in the most evident and wellknown truths
that the moment they are fullyembraced it becomes
a difficulty to conceive that we could ever have been
not aware of them and hence the more simple

clear and obvious any principle is rendered the
more likely is its exposition to elicit those common
remarks √¢Äú of course of course√¢Äù √¢Äúno one could
ever doubt that√¢Äù √¢Äúthis is all very true but there
is nothing new brought to lightnothing that was

not familiar to every one√¢Äù √¢Äúthere needs no ghost
to tell us that√¢Äù

i am convinced that a verbose

mystical and partially obscure way of writing on
such a subject is the most likely to catch the atten
tion of the multitude the generality verify the
observation of tacitus √¢Äúomne ignotum pro miri
fico√¢Äù and when anything is made very plain to

them are apt to fancy that they knew it already
so that the explanations of scientific truths are
likely for a considerable time at least to be by
most men underrated the more the more perfectly
they accomplish their object

a very slow progress therefore towards popu
larity is the utmost that can be expected for such a
treatise as i have endeavoured to make the present

preface

xxvii

i have felt myself bound however not only as a
member of society but more especially as a minis

ter of the gospel to use my endeavours towards
promoting an object which to me appears highly

important and what is much more whose import
ance is appreciated by very few besides the cause
of truth universally and not least of religious

truth is benefited by everything that tends to
promote sound reasoning and facilitate the detec
tion of fallacy the adversaries of our faith would

i am convinced have been on many occasions more
satisfactorily answered and would have had fewer
openings for cavil had a thorough acquaintance
with logic been a more common qualification than
it is in lending my endeavours therefore whether

with greater or less success towards this object i
trust that i am neither uselessly nor unsuitably
employed
those who are engaged in or designed for the
sacred ministry and all others who are sensible that
the cause of true religion is not a concern of the

ministry alone should remember that this is no
time to forego any of the advantages which that

cause may derive from an active and judicious cul
tivation of the faculties among the enemies of
christianity in the present day are included if i

mistake not a very different description of persons

preface

from those who were chiefly to be met with a cen
tury or even half a century ago what were called
√¢Äúmen of wit and pleasure about town√¢Äù√¢Äîignorant
shallow flippant declaimers or dull and powerless
pretenders to philosophy among the enemies of
the gospel now are to be found men not only of
learning and of ingenuity but of cultivated argu

logic

if the advocates

of our religion think pro

inquiry that their opponents do not

not trust too carelessly to the strength of their
cause truth will indeed prevail where all other
points are nearly equal but it may suffer a tempo
rary discomfiture if hasty assumptions unsound
arguments and vague and empty declamation oc

cupy the place of a train of close accurate and
luminous reasoning
it is not however solely or chiefly for polemical

purposes that the cultivation of the reasoning
faculty is desirable in persuading and investigating
in learning or teaching in all the multitude of
cases in which it is our object to arrive at just
conclusions or to lead others to them it is most
important a knowledge of logical rules will not

indeed supply the want of other knowledge nor
was it ever proposed by any one who really under

preface

xxix

stood this science to substitute it for any other but
it is no less true that no other can be substituted

for this that it is valuable in every branch of study
and that it enables us to use the knowledge we pos
sess to the greatest advantage it is to be hoped
therefore that those academical bodies who have

been wise enough to retain this science will instead
of being persuaded to abandon it give their atten
tion rather to its improvement and more effectual
cultivation

introduction

logic in the most extensive sense which the f√¢∫r 
name can with propriety be made to bear may
be considered as the science and also as the

art of reasoning it investigates the princi
ples on which argumentation is conducted and
furnishes rules to secure the mind from error

in its deductions its most appropriate office
however is that of instituting an analysis of the
process of the mind in reasoning and in this
point of view it is as has been stated strictly
a science while considered in reference to the

practical rules above mentioned it may be
called the art of reasoning this distinction
as will hereafter appear has been overlooked
or not clearly pointed out by most writers on
the subject logic having been in general re
garded as merely an art and its claim to hold

a place among the sciences having been ex
pressly denied

elements of logic

considering how early logic attracted the
attention of philosophers it may appear sur

prising that so little progress should have been
made as is confessedly the case in developing
its principles and perfecting the detail of the
system and this circumstance has been
brought forward as a proof of the barrenness
and futility of the study but a similar argu
ment might have been urged with no less
plausibility at a period not very remote against
the study of natural philosophy and very re
cently against that of chemistry no science
can be expected to make any considerable pro
gress which is not cultivated on right princi
ples whatever may be the inherent vigour of
the plant it will neither be flourishing nor fruit
ful till it meet with a suitable soil and culture

and in no case is the remark more applicable
than in the present the greatest mistakes hav

ing always prevailed respecting the nature of
logic and its province having in consequence
been extended by many writers to subjects
with which it has no proper connexion

in

deed with the exception of aristotle who is
himself not entirely exempt from the errors in
question hardly a writer on logic can be
mentioned who has clearly perceived and
steadily kept in view throughout its real na
ture and object

before his time no distinc

tion was drawn between the science of which

introduction



we are speaking and that which is now usually
called metaphysics a circumstance which

alone shows how small was the progress made
in earlier times indeed those who first turned

their attention to the subject hardly thought
of inquiring into the process of reasoning it
self but confined themselves almost entirely to
certain preliminary points the discussion of

which is if logically considered subordinate
to that of the main inquiry

subject of logic or as it was then called dia
lectics divided his work into three parts the
the first of which upon consequences is cen

sured by socrates plato parmen for ob
scurity and confusion in his second part
however he furnished that interrogatory me

thod of disputation igrnail which socrates
adopted and which has since borne his name
the third part of his work was devoted to
what may not improperly be termed the art of

wrangling igar√¢∫√¢∫l which supplied the dispu
tant with a collection of sophistical questions
so contrived that the concession of some

point which seemed unavoidable immediately
involved some glaring absurdity this if it is
to be esteemed as at all falling within the pro

sented it as its principal or proper business
the greek philosophers generally have unfor
tunately devoted too much attention to it but
we must beware of falling into the vulgar
error of supposing the ancients to have re
garded as a serious and intrinsically important
study that which in fact they considered as an
ingenious recreation the disputants diverted
themselves in their leisure hours by making
trial of their own and their adversarys acute
ness in the endeavour mutually to perplex
each other with subtle fallacies much in the

same way as men amuse themselves with pro
pounding and guessing riddles or with the
game of chess to each of which diversions
the sportive disputations of the ancients bore
much resemblance they were closely analo

gous to the wrestling and other exercises of
the gymnasium these last being reckoned
conducive to bodily vigour and activity as the
former were to habits of intellectual acuteness

but the immediate object in each was a sport
ive not a serious contest though doubtless
fashion and emulation often occasioned an

undue importance to be attached to success in
each

zeno then is hardly to be regarded as any

further a logician than as to what respects his
erotetic method of disputation a course of

argument constructed on this principle being

introduction



properly an hypothetical sorites which may
easily be reduced into a series of syllogisms

to zeno succeeded euclid of megara and fl√¢∫√¢∫
antisthenes both pupils of socrates the
former of these prosecuted the subject of the

third part of his predecessors treatise and is
said to have been the author of many of the
fallacies attributed to the stoical school

of

the writings of the latter nothing certain is
known if however we suppose the above
mentioned sect to be his disciples in this study
and to have retained his principles he certainly
took a more correct view of the subject than
euclid the stoics divided all xexrd every
thing that could be said into three classes
st the simple term d the proposition

d the syllogism viz the hypothetical for
they seem to have had little notion of a more
rigorous analysis of argument than into that
familiar form

we must not here omit to notice the merits

of archytas to whom we are indebted for the archytas
doctrine of the categories he however as
well as the other writers on the subject ap
pears to have had no distinct view of the pro
per object and just limits of the science of

logic but to have blended with it metaphy
sical discussions not strictly connected with it

and to have dwelt on the investigation of the
nature of terms and propositions without



elements of logic

maintaining a constant reference to the prin
ciples of reasoning to which all the rest should
be made subservient
aristotle

the state then in which aristotle found the
science if indeed it can properly be said to
have existed at all before his time appears to
have been nearly this the division into sim
ple terms propositions and syllogisms had

been slightly sketched out the doctrine of the
categories and perhaps that of the opposition
of propositions had been laid down and as
some believe the analysis of species into genus
and differentia had been introduced by so
crates these at best were rather the mate
rials of the system than the system itself the
foundation of which indeed he distinctly claims

the merit of having laid and which remains
fundamentally the same as he left it
it has been remarked that the logical sys
tem is one of those few theories which have

been begun and perfected by the same indivi
dual the history of its discovery as far as
the main principles of the science are con
cerned properly commences and ends with

aristotle and this may perhaps in part ac
count for the subsequent perversions of it
the brevity and simplicity of its fundamental
truths to which point indeed all real science

is perpetually tending has probably led many
to suppose that something much more com

introduction



plex abtruse and mysterious remained to be
discovered the vanity too by which all men
are prompted unduly to magnify their own
pursuits has led unphilosophical minds not in
this case alone but in many others to extend
the boundaries of their respective sciences not
by the patient developement and just applica

tion of the principles of those sciences but by
wandering into irrelevant subjects the mys
tical employment of numbers by pythagoras
in matters utterly foreign to arithmetic is per
haps the earliest instance of the kind a more

curious and important one is the degeneracy of
astronomy into judicial astrology but none

 
is more striking than the misapplication of

a az

logic by those who have treated of it as √¢Äúthe
art of rightly employing the rational faculties





or who have intruded it into the province of

natural philosophy and regarded the syllogism
as an engine for the investigation of nature 
while they overlooked the boundless field that
was before them within the legitimate limits
of the science and perceived not the import

ance and difficulty of the task of completing
and properly filling up the masterly sketch be
fore them

the writings of aristotle were not only ab
solutely lost to the world for about two cen
turies but seem to have been but little studied

for a long time after their recovery an art

however of logic derived from the principles
traditionally preserved by his disciples seems

to have been generally known and to have
been employed by cicero in his philosophical

galen

works but the pursuit of the science seems
to have been abandoned for a long time early
in the christian era the peripatetic doctrines
experienced a considerable revival and we
meet with the names of galen and porphyry

porphyry

as logicians but it is not till the fifth century
boethius

that aristotles logical works were translated
into latin by the celebrated boethius not
one of these seems to have made any consider
able advances in developing the theory of rea
soning of galens labours little is known

and porphyrys principal work is merely on
the predicables we have little of the science
till the revival of learning among the arabians
by whom aristotles treatises on this as well
as on other subjects were eagerly studied

passing by the names of some byzantine
writers of no great importance we come to
schoolmen

the times of the schoolmen whose waste of

ingenuity and frivolous subtilty of disputation

need not be enlarged upon it may be suffi
cient to observe that their fault did not lie in

their diligent study of logic and the high value
they set upon it but in their utterly mistaking
the true nature and object of the science and
by the attempt to employ it for the purpose of

introduction



physical discoveries involving every subject in
a mist of words to the exclusion of sound phi
losophical investigation their errors may
serve to account for the strong terms in which
bacon sometimes appears to censure logical bacon
pursuits but that this censure was intended to
bear against the extravagant perversions not
the legitimate cultivation of the science may
be proved from his own observations on the
subject in his advancement of learning
his moderation however was not imitated

in other quarters even locke confounds in locke
one sweeping censure the aristotelic theory
with the absurd misapplications and perver
sions of it in later years his objection to the
science as unserviceable in the discovery of
truth which has of late been often repeated
while it holds good in reference to many mis
named logicians indicates that with regard to
the

true nature of the science itself he had no

clearer notions than they have of the proper
province of logic viz reasoning and of the
distinct character of that operation from the
observations and experiments which are essen
tial to the study of nature
an error apparently different but substan
tially the same pervades the treatises of watts watts
and other modern writers on the subject
perceiving the inadequacy of the syllogistic
theory to the vast purposes to which others



elements of logic

had attempted to apply it he still craved after
the attainment of some equally comprehensive
and allpowerful system which he according

ly attempted to construct under the title of
the right use of reason which was to be a
method of invigorating and properly directing
all the powers of the mind√¢Äîa most magnifi
cent object indeed but one which not only
does not fall under the province of logic but
cannot be accomplished by any one science or
system that can even be conceived to exist
the attempt to comprehend so wide a field is
no extension of science but a mere verbal ge
neralization which leads only to vague and
barren declamation in every pursuit the
more precise and definite our object the more
likely we are to attain some valuable result 

if like the platonists who sought after the
a√£∫r√£°yzoy the abstract idea of good we pur
sue some specious but illdefined scheme of
universal knowledge we shall lose thesub
stance while grasping at a shadow and be
wilder ourselves in empty generalities
it is not perhaps much to be wondered at
that in still later times several ingenious wri
ters forming their notions of the science itself
from professed masters in it such as havejust
been alluded to and judging of its value from
their failures should have treated the aristo

telic system with so much reprobation and

introduction

ii

scorn too much prejudiced to bestow on it
the requisite attention for enabling them clearly
to understand its real character and object or
even to judge correctly from the little they
did understand they have assailed the study

with a host of objections so totally irrelevant
and consequently impotent that considering
the talents and general information of those
from whom they proceed they might excite
astonishment in any one who did not fully
estimate the force of very early prejudice

logic has usually been considered by these views
incorresof the
objectors as professing to furnish a peculiar
method of reasoning instead of a method of
analyzing that mental process which must in
variably take place in all correct reasoning

and accordingly they have contrasted the or
dinary mode of reasoning with the syllogistic
and have brought forward with an air of
triumph the argumentative skill of many who

never learned the system a mistake no less
gross than if any one should regard grammar
as a peculiar language and should contend
against its utility on the ground that many

speak correctly who never studied the prin

ciples of grammar for logic which is as it
were the grammar of reasoning does not
bring forward the regular syllogism as a dis
tinct mode of argumentation designed to be
substituted for any other mode but as the



elements of logic

form to which all correct reasoning may be

ultimately reduced and which consequently
serves the purpose when we are employing
logic as an art of a test to try the validity of
any argument in the same manner as by che
mical analysis we develope and submit to a
distinct examination the elements of which

any compound body is composed and are thus

enabled to detect any latent sophistication and
impurity

complaints have also been made that logic
leaves untouched the greatest difficulties and
those which are the sources of the chief errors

in reasoning viz the ambiguity or indistinct
ness of terms and the doubts respecting the

degrees of evidence in various propositions
an objection which is not to be removed by
any such attempt as that of watts to lay down

√¢Äúrules for forming clear ideas and for guiding
the judgment√¢Äù but by replying that no art is
to be censured for not teaching more than falls
within its province and indeed more than can

be taught by any conceivable art such a sys
tem of universal knowledge as should instruct
us in the full meaning or meanings of very term
and the truth or falsity certainty or uncer
taintyof every proposition thus superseding
all other studies it is most unphilosophical to
expect or even to imagine

and to find fault

with logic for not performing this is as if one

introduction



should object to the science of optics for not
giving sight to the blind or as if like the

man of whom warburton tells a story in his
div leg one should complain of a reading
glass for being of no service to a person who
had never learned to read

in fact the difficulties and errors above

alluded to are not in the process of reasoning
itself which alone is the appropriate province
of logic but in the subjectmatter about
which it is employed this process will have
been correctly conducted if it have conformed

to the logical rules which preclude the possi
bility of any error creeping in between the
principles from which we are arguing and the
conclusions we deduce from them

but still

that conclusion may be false if the principles
we start from are so

in like manner no

arithmetical skill will secure a correct result

to a calculation unless the data are correct
from which we calculate nor does any one
on that account undervalue arithmetic and

yet the objection against logic rests on no
better foundation

there is in fact a striking analogy in this
respect between the two sciences all num
bers which are the subject of arithmetic must
be numbers of some things whether coins per
sons measures or any thing else but to in

troduce into the science any notice of the



elements of logic

things respecting which calculations are made
would be evidently irrelevant and would de
stroy its scientific character we proceed therefore with arbitrary signs representing numbers
in the abstract so also does logic pronounce

on the validity of a regularlyconstructed ar
gument equally well though arbitrary symbols
may have been substituted for the terms and
consequently without any regard to the
things signified by those terms and the pos
sibility of doing this though the employment
of such arbitrary symbols has been absurdly
objected to even by writers who understood
not only arithmetic but algebra is a proof of
the strictly scientific character of the system

but many professed logical writers not at
tending to the circumstances which have been

just mentioned have wandered into disquisi
tions on various branches of knowledge

dis

quisitions which must evidently be as bound
less as human knowledge itself since there is
no subject on which reasoning is not employed
and to which consequently logic may not be
applied the error lies in regarding every
thing as the proper province of logic to which
it is applicable a similar error is complained
of by aristotle as having taken place with
respect to rhetoric of which indeed we find
specimens in the arguments of several of the
interlocutors in cic de oratore

introduction



from what has been said it will be evident

that there is hardly any subject to which it is
so difficult to introduce the student in a clear

and satisfactory manner as the one we are
now engaged in in any other branch of

knowledge the reader if he have any previous
acquaintance with the subject will usually be
so far the better prepared for comprehending
the exposition of the principles or if he be
entirely a stranger to it will at least come to

the study with a mind unbiassed and free from
prejudices and misconceptions whereas in
the present case it cannot but happen that
many who have given some attention to logi
cal pursuits or what are usually considered
as such will have rather been bewildered by
fundamentally erroneous views than prepared

by the acquisition of just principles for ulterior
progress and that not a few who pretend not
to any acquaintance whatever with the science

will yet have imbibed either such prejudices
against it or such false notions respecting its
nature as cannot but prove obstacles in their
study of it
there is however a difficulty which exists
more or less in all abstract pursuits though
it is perhaps more felt in this and often occa

sions it to be rejected by beginners as dry and
tedious viz the difficulty of perceiving to

what ultimate endto what practical or inte



elements of logic

resting application√¢Äîthe abstract principles lead
which are first laid before the student so that

he will often have to work his way patiently

through the most laborious part of the system
before he can gain any clear idea of the drift
and intention of it

this complaint has often been made by
chemical students who are wearied with de

scriptions of oxygen hydrogen and other in
visible elements before they have any know
ledge respecting such bodies as commonly
present themselves to the senses and ac

cordingly some teachers of chemistry obviate
in a great degree this objection by adopting
the analytical instead of the synthetical mode
of procedure when they are first introducing
the subject to beginners ie instead of syn
thetically enumerating the elementary sub
stancesproceeding next to the simplest com
binations of these and concluding with those

more complex substances which are of the
most common occurrence they begin by ana
lyzing these last and resolving them step by
step into their simple elements thus at once
presenting the subject in an interesting point
of view and clearly setting forth the object of
it the synthetical form of teaching is in
deed sufficiently interesting to one who has

made considerable progress in any study and
being more concise regular and systematic

introduction



is the form in which our knowledge naturally
arranges itself in the mind and is retained by
the memory but the analytical is the more
interesting easy and natural kind of introduc
tion as being the form in which the first in
vention or discovery of any kind of system
must originally have taken place

it may be advisable therefore to begin by
giving a slight sketch in this form of the lo
gical system before we enter regularly upon
the details of it the reader will thus be pre
sented with a kind of imaginary history of the
course of inquiry by which the logical system
may be conceived to have occurred to a phi
losophical mind

chapter i
analytical outline of the science

√¢ß 

in every instance in which we reason in the
strict sense of the word i e make use of argu

ments whether for the sake of refuting an ad
versary or of conveying instruction or of
satisfying our own minds on any point what

ever may be the subject we are engaged on a
certain process takes place in the mind which
is one and the same in all cases provided it be
correctly conducted

of course it cannot be supposed that every
one is even conscious of this process in his own

mind much less is competent to explain the
principles on which it proceeds which indeed
is and cannot but be the case with every other
process respecting which any system has been
formed the practice not only may exist in
dependently of the theory but must have pre
ceded the theory there must have been lan
guage before a system of grammar could be
devised and musical compositions previous
to the science of music this by the way
will serve to expose the futility of the popular

analytical outline



objection against logic that men may reason
very well who know nothing of it the pa
rallel instances adduced shew that such an
 locke has a great deal to this purpose eg in
chap xvii √¢Äúon reason√¢Äù which by the way he perpe
tually confounds with reasoning he says in √¢ß√¢Äù if syl
logisms must be taken for the only proper instrument of
reason and means of knowledge it will follow that before
aristotle there was not one man that did or could know

any thing by reason and that since the invention of syl
logisms there is not one in ten thousand that doth but

god has not been so sparing to men to make them barely
twolegged creatures and left it to aristotle to make them
rational i e those few of them that he could get so to
examine the grounds of syllogisms as to see that in above
threescore ways that three propositions may be laid toge
ther there are but fourteen wherein one may be sure that
the conclusion is right√¢Äù c c √¢Äúgod has been more
bountiful to mankind than so he has given them a mind
that can reason without being instructed in methods of
syllogizing√¢Äù c c all this is not at all less absurd than
if any one on being told of the discoveries of modern
chemists respecting caloric and on hearing described the
process by which it is conducted through a boiler into the

water which it converts into a gas of sufficient elasticity
to overcome the pressure of the atmosphere c should
reply √¢Äúif all this were so it would follow that before the
time of these chemists no one ever did or could make any
liquor boil√¢Äù
in an ordinary obscure and trifling writer all this
confusion of thought and commonplace declamation
might as well have been left unnoticed but it is due to
the general ability and to the celebrity of such an author
as locke that errors of this kind should be exposed
he presently after inserts an encomium upon aristotle
in which he is equally unfortunate he praises him for
the √¢Äúinvention of syllogisms√¢Äù to which he certainly had
no more claim than linnaeus to the creation of plants and
animals or hervey to the praise of having made the blood
c 



elements of logic

objection might be applied in many other
cases where its absurdity would be obvious
and that there is no ground for deciding thence
either that the system has no tendency to im
prove practice or that even if it had not it
might not still be a dignified and interesting
pursuit
one of the chief impediments to the attain
ment of a just view of the nature and object of

logic is the not fully understanding or not
sufficiently keeping in mind the sameness of
the reasoning process in all cases if as the
ordinary mode of speaking would seem to in

dicate mathematical reasoning and theologi
cal and metaphysical and political c were
essentially different from each other ie dif
ferent kinds of reasoning it would follow that
supposing there could be at all any such
science as we have described logic there must
be so many different species or at least differ
ent branches of logic and such is perhaps

the most prevailing notion nor is this much
to be wondered at since it is evident to all
circulate or lavoisier to that of having formed the atmo
sphere we breathe and the utility of this invention con
sists according to him in the great service done against
those who were not ashamed to deny anything a service

which never could have been performed had syllogisms
been an invention of aristotles for what sophist could
ever have consented to restrict himself to one particular
kind of arguments dictated by his opponent

analytical outline



that some men converse and write in an argu
mentative way very justly on one subject and
very erroneously on another in which again
others excel who fail in the former

this 

error may be at once illustrated and removed
by considering the parallel instance of arith
metic in which every one is aware that the
process of a calculation is not affected by the
nature of the objects whose numbers are be
fore us but that eg the multiplication of
a number is the very same operation whether
it be a number of men of miles or of pounds

though nevertheless persons may perhaps be
found who are accurate in calculations relative

to natural philosophy and incorrect in those of
political economy from their different degrees
of skill in the subjects of these two sciences
not surely because there are different arts of
arithmetic applicable to each of these respec
tively

others again who are aware that the simple
system of logic may be applied to all subjects
whatever are yet disposed to view it as a pe
culiar method of reasoning and not as it is a
method of unfolding and analyzing our rea

soning whence many have been led e g the
author of the philosophy of rhetoric to

talk of comparing syllogistic reasoning with
moral reasoning taking it for granted that it

is possible to reason correctly without reason

sub

ing logically which is in fact as great a blun
der as if any one were to mistake grammar for
a peculiar language and to suppose it possible
to speak correctly without speaking gramma
tically they have in short considered logic

as an art of reasoning whereas so far as it is
an art it is the art of reasoning the logicians
object being not to lay down principles by
which one may reason but by which all must
reason even though they are not distinctly
aware of them√¢Äîto lay down rules not which

may be followed with advantage but which
cannot possibly be departed from in sound rea
soning these misapprehensions and objec
tions being such as lie on the very threshold
of the subject it would have been hardly pos
sible without noticing them to convey any

just notion of the nature and design of the
logical system
√¢ß 

supposing it then to have been perceived
that the operation of reasoning is in all
cases the same the analysis of that operation
could not fail to strike the mind as an interest

ing matter of inquiry and moreover since
apparent arguments which are unsound and
inconclusive are so often employed either

from error or design and since even those
who are not misled by these fallacies are so

analytical outline



often at a loss to detect and expose them in a
manner satisfactory to others or even to them
selves it could not but appear desirable to
lay down some general rules of reasoning ap
plicable to all cases by which a person might
be enabled the more readily and clearly to
state the grounds of his own conviction
or of his objection to the arguments of
an opponent instead of arguing at random
without any fixed and acknowledged princi
ples to guide his procedure such rules
would be analogous to those of arithmetic
which obviate the tediousness and uncertainty
of calculations in the head wherein after
much labour different persons might arrive at
different results without any of them being
able distinctly to point out the error of the

rest a system of such rules it is obvious
must instead of deserving to be called the art
of wrangling be more justly characterised as
the √¢Äúart of cutting short wrangling√¢Äù by bring
ing the parties to issue at once if not to

agreement and thus saving a waste of in
genuity

in pursuing the supposed investigation it √¢∫f
will be found that every conclusion is deduced
in reality from two other propositions thence

called premises for though one of these may
be and commonly is suppressed it must
nevertheless be understood as admitted as



elements of logic

may easily be made evident by supposing the
denial of the suppressed premiss which will
at once invalidate the argument e g if any
one from perceiving that √¢Äúthe world exhibits
marks of design√¢Äù infers that √¢Äúit must have had

an intelligent author√¢Äù though he may not be
aware in his own mind of the existence of any
other premiss he will readily understand if it
be denied that √¢Äúwhatever exhibits marks of

design must have had an intelligent author√¢Äù
that the affirmative of that proposition is ne

cessary to the validity of the argument an
argument thus stated regularly and at full
length is called a syllogism which therefore
is evidently not a peculiar kind of argument

but only a peculiar form of expression in which
every argument may be stated
when one of the premises is suppressed

which for brevitys sake it usually is the ar
gument is called an enthymeme and it may
be worth while to remark that when the argu
ment is in this state the objections of an
opponent are or rather appear to be of two
kinds viz either objections to the assertion
itself or objections to its force as an argument
eg in the above instance an atheist may be
conceived either denying that the world does
exhibit marks of design or denying that it
follows from thence that it had an intelligent

author now it is important to keep in mind



analytical outline

that the only difference in the two cases

is that in the one the expressed premiss is
denied in the other the suppressed for the
jorce as an argument of either premiss depends
on the other premiss if both be admitted the

conclusion legitimately connected with them
cannot be denied

it is evidently immaterial to the argument
whether the conclusion be placed first or last

but it may be proper to remark that a premiss
placed after its conclusion is called the reason

of it and is introduced by one of those con
junctions which are called causal viz √¢Äú since√¢Äù
√¢Äú because√¢Äù c which may indeed be employed

to designate a premiss whether it came first or
last the illative conjunctions √¢Äútherefore√¢Äù
c designate the conclusion





it is a circumstance which often occasions
error and perplexity that both these classes of

conjunctions have also another signification
being employed to denote respectively cause
and effect as well as premiss and conclusion 
eg if i say to use an instance employed by
aristotle √¢Äúyonder is a fixed star because it
twinkles√¢Äù or √¢Äúit twinkles and therefore is a
fixed star√¢Äù i employ these conjunctions to
denote the connection of premiss and conclusion
for it is plain that the twinkling of the star is

not the cause of its being fixed but only the

cause of my knowing that it is so but if i say



elements of logic

√¢Äúit twinkles because it is a fixed star√¢Äù or √¢Äúit

is a fixed star and therefore twinkles√¢Äù i am
using the same conjunctions to denote the con
 and nection of cause and effect for in this case the
twinkling of the star being evident to the eye
would hardly need to be proved but might need
to be accounted for there are however

many cases in which the cause is employed to
prove the existence of its effect especially in
arguments relating to future events the cause
and the reason in that case coincide and this

contributes to their being so often confounded
together in other cases

in an argument such as the example above
given it is as has been said impossible for

any one who admits both premises to avoid
admitting the conclusion but there will be

√¢∫ √¢Äúfrequently an apparent connection of premises
with a conclusion which does not in reality
follow from them though to the inattentive or
unskilful the argument may appear to be valid
and there are many other cases in which a

doubt may exist whether the argument be valid
or not i e whether it be possible or not to
admit the premises and yet deny the conclu
sion it is of the highest importance there

that the crops are likely to be abundant

fore to lay down some regular form to which
every valid argument may be reduced and to

devise a rule which shall show the validity of

every argument in that form and consequently
the unsoundness of any apparent argument
which cannot be reduced to iteg if such
an argument as this be proposed √¢Äúevery ra
tional agent is accountable brutes are not ra
tional agents therefore they are not account

laws to the genius of their nation solon did
this therefore he was a wise legislator√¢Äù there

are some perhaps who would not perceive
any fallacy in such arguments especially if en
veloped in a cloud of words and still more
when the conclusion is true or which comes
to the same point if they are disposed to be

lieve it and others might perceive indeed but
might be at a loss to explain the fallacy now
these apparent arguments exactly correspond
respectively with the following the absurdity
of the conclusions from which is manifest

√¢Äúevery horse is an animal sheep are not
horses therefore they are not animals√¢Äù and
√¢Äúall vegetables grow an animal grows there

i have said correspond exactly considered as

arguments with the former the question
respecting the validity of an argument being
not whether the conclusion be true but whe

ther it follows from the premises adduced
this mode of exposing a fallacy by bringing
forward a similar one whose conclusion is ob

viously absurd is often and very advan
tageously resorted to in addressing those who
are ignorant of logical rules but to lay
down such rules and employ them as a test

is evidently a safer and more compendious as
well as a more philosophical mode of proceed
ing to attain these it would plainly be ne

cessary to analyze some clear and valid argu
ments and to observe in what their conclusive
ness consists

let us suppose then such an examination
to be made of the syllogism above mentioned
√¢Äúwhatever exhibits marks of design had an
intelligent author the world exhibits marks
of design therefore the world had an intelli
gent author√¢Äù in the first of these premises
we find it assumed universally of the class of
√¢Äúthings which exhibit marks of design√¢Äù that
they had an intelligent author and in the
 an exposure of some of humes fallacies in his
√¢Äúessay on miracles√¢Äù and elsewhere was attempted on
this plan a few years ago in a pamphlet published ano
nymously as the nature of the argument required but
which i see no reason against acknowledging entitled

√¢Äúhistoric doubts relative to napoleon buonaparte√¢Äù in
which it was shown that the existence of that extraordi

nary person could not on humes principles be received
as a wellauthenticated fact since it rests on evidence less

strong than that which supports the scriptures

analytical outline



other premiss √¢Äúthe world is referred to that
class as comprehended in it now it is evident
that whatever is said of the whole of a class

may be said of any thing comprehended in
that class so that we are thus authorized to

say of the world that it had an intelligent
author again if we examine a syllogism
with a negative conclusion as eg √¢Äúnothing
which exhibits marks of design could have
been produced by chance the world exhibits
c therefore the world could not have been

produced by chance the process of reason
ing will be found to be the same since it is
evident that whatever is denied universally of
any class may be denied of anything that is
comprehended in that class
on further examination it will be found that

all valid arguments whatever may be easily re
duced to such a form as that of the foregoing
syllogisms and that consequently the prin
ciple on which they are constructed is the
universal principle of reasoning
so elliptical indeed is the ordinary mode of

expression even of those who are considered
as prolix writers ie so much is implied and
left to be understood in the course of argu
ment in comparison of what is actually stated

most men being impatient even to excess of
any appearance of unnecessary and tedious for
mality of statement that a single sentence



elements of logic

will often be found though perhaps considered
as a single argument to contain compressed
into a short compass a chain of several distinct
arguments but if each of these be fully deve
loped and the whole of what the author in
tended to imply be stated expressly it will be
found that all the steps even of the longest and
most complex train of reasoning may be re
duced into the above form

it is a mistake which might appear scarcely
worthy of notice had not so many even es
teemed writers fallen into it to imagine that

aristotle and other logicians meant to propose
that this prolix form of unfolding arguments
should universally supersede in argumentative
discourses the common forms of expression
and that to reason logically means to state
all arguments at full length in the syllogistic
form and aristotle has even been charged

with inconsistency for not doing so it has
been said that √¢Äúin his treatises of ethics
politics c he argues like a rational creature
and never attempts to bring his own system
into practice√¢Äù as well might a chemist be

charged with inconsistency for making use of
any of the compound substances that are com
monly employed without previously analyzing
and resolving them into their simple elements

as well might it be imagined that to speak

ut to resume the investigation of the prin

ciples of reasoning the maxim resulting from
the examination of a syllogism in the fore

going form and of the application of which
every valid argument is in reality an instance
is √¢Äúthat whatever is predicated i e affirmed

or denied universally of any class of things
may be predicated in like manner viz af
 this excellent illustration is cited from a passage in
an anonymous pamphlet √¢Äúan examination of ketts
logic√¢Äù the author displays though in a hasty produc

tion great reach of thought as well as knowledge of his
subject



elements of logic

firmed or denied of any thing comprehended
in that class√¢Äù this is the principle com

monly called the dictum de omni et nullo for
the establishment of which we are indebted to

aristotle and which is the keystone of his

whole logical system it is not a little re
markable that some otherwise judicious wri

ters should have been so carried away by their
zeal against that philosopher as to speak with
scorn and ridicule of this principle on account
of its obviousness and simplicity though they
would probably perceive at once in any other
case that it is the greatest triumph of philoso
phy to refer many and seemingly very various
phenomena to one or a very few simple prin
ciples and that the more simple and evident
such a principle is provided it be truly appli

cable to all the cases in question the greater is
its value and scientific beauty if indeed any
principle be regarded as not thus applicable
that is an objection to it of a different kind
such an objection against aristotles dictum

no one has ever attempted to establish by any
kind of proof but it has often been taken for
granted it being as has been stated very
commonly supposed without examination that
the syllogism is a distinct kind of argument and

that the rules of it accordingly do not apply
nor were intended to apply to all reasoning

whatever under this misapprehension camp

analytical outline



bell√¢Äù labours with some ingenuity and not
without an air of plausibility to show that
every syllogism must be futile and worthless

because the premises virtually assert the con
clusion little dreaming of course that his

objections however specious lie against the
process of reasoning itself universally and will

therefore of course apply to those very argu
ments which he is himself adducing
it is much more extraordinary to find ano

ther authort adopting expressly the very
same objections and yet distinctly admitting
within a few pages the possibility of reducing
every course of argument to a series of syl
logisms
the same writer brings an objection against
the dictum of aristotle which it may be
worth while to notice briefly for the sake of

setting in a clearer light the real character and
object of that principle its application being
as has been seen to a regular and conclusive
syllogism he supposes it intended to prove and
make evident the conclusiveness of such a syl

logism and remarks how unphilosophical it is
to attempt giving a demonstration of a demon

stration and certainly the charge would be
just if we could imagine the logicians object
to be to increase the certainty of a conclusion

which we are supposed to have already arrived
at by the clearest possible mode of proof but
it is very strange that such an idea should ever
have occurred to one who had even the slight

est tincture of natural philosophy for it might
as well be imagined that a natural philosophers
or a chemists design is to strengthen the tes

timony of our senses by a priori reasoning and
to convince us that a stone when thrown will

fall to the ground and that gunpowder will
explode when fired because they show that
according to their principles those phenomena
must take place as they do but it would be
reckoned a mark of the grossest ignorance and
stupidity not to be aware that their object is
not to prove the existence of an individual phe
nomenon which our eyes have witnessed but
as the phrase is to account for it i e to
show according to what principle it takes place
√¢Äîto refer in short the individual case to a
general law of nature the object of aristo
tles dictum is precisely analogous he had
doubtless no thought of adding to the force of
any individual syllogism his design was to
point out the general principle on which that
process is conducted which takes place in each
syllogism and as the laws of nature as they
are called are in reality merely generalized
jacts of which all the phenomena coming

under them are particular instances so the

analytical outline



proof drawn from aristotles dictum is not a

distinct demonstration brought to confirm
another demonstration but is merely a gene
ralised and abstract statement of all demonstra

tion whatever and is therefore in fact the
very demonstration which mutatis mutandis
accommodated to the various subjectmatters
is actually employed in each particular case

in order to trace more distinctly the differ
ent steps of the abstracting process by which
any particular argument may be brought into
the most general form we may first take a
syllogism stated accurately and at full length
such as the example formerly given √¢Äúwhat
ever exhibits marks of design c and then
somewhat generalise the expression by sub
stituting as in algebra arbitrary unmeaning

symbols for the significant terms that were ori
ginally used the syllogism will then stand
thus √¢Äúevery b is a c is b therefore c is
a√¢Äù the reasoning is no less evidently valid
when thus stated whatever terms a b and c
respectively may be supposed to stand for
such terms may indeed be inserted as to make

all or any of the assertions false but it will
still be no less impossible for any one who
admits the truth of the premises in an argu
ment thus constructed to deny the conclusion
and this it is that constitutes the conclusiveness

of an argument
d 



elements of logic

viewing then the syllogism thus expressed
it appears clearly that √¢Äúa stands for any thing
whatever that is affirmed of a whole class√¢Äù

viz of every b √¢Äúwhich comprehends or con
tains in it something else√¢Äù viz c of which b
is in the second premiss affirmed and that
consequently the first term a is in the con
clusion predicated of the third c
now to assert the validity of this process
now before us is to state the very dictum we
are treating of with hardly even a verbal alter
ation viz

 anything whatever predicated of a
whole class

 under which class something else is con
tained



 may be predicated of that which is so
contained

the three members into which the maxim is

here distributed correspond to the three pro
positions of the syllogism to which they are
intended respectively to apply
the advantage of substituting for the terms
in a regular syllogism arbitrary unmeaning
symbols such as letters of the alphabet is
much the same as in mathematics the reason

ing itself is then considered by itself clearly
and without any risk of our being misled by
the truth or falsity of the conclusion which
is in fact accidental and variable the essen

analytical outline



tial point being as far as the argument is con
cerned the connexion between the premises and
the

conclusion

we are thus enabled to

embrace the general principle of all reasoning
and to perceive its applicability to an indefinite
number of individual cases

that aristotle

therefore should have been accused of making
use of these symbols for the purpose of dark
ening his demonstrations and that too by per
sons not unacquainted with geometry and
algebra is truly astonishing if a geometer
instead of designating the four angles of a
square by four letters were to call them north
south east and west he would not render the
demonstration of a theorem the easier and the

learner would be much more likely to be per
plexed in the application of it
it belongs then exclusively to a syllogism
properly so called i e a valid argument so
stated that its conclusiveness is evident from

the mere form of the expression that if letters
or any other unmeaning symbols be substi
tuted for the several terms the validity of the

argument shall still be evident whenever
this is not the case the supposed argument is
either unsound and sophistical or else may be
reduced without any alteration of its mean
ing into the syllogistic form in which

form the test just mentioned may be applied
to it





detection of
unsound

guments

elements of logic

what is called an unsound or fallacious ar

ar

gument i e an apparent argument which is
in reality none cannot of course be reduced
into this form but when stated in the form

most nearly approaching to this that is possi
ble its fallaciousness becomes more evident
from its nonconformity to the foregoing rule 
eg √¢Äúwhoever is capable of deliberate crime

is responsible an infant is not capable of de
liberate crime therefore an infant is not
responsible√¢Äù here the term √¢Äúresponsible√¢Äù is

affirmed universally of √¢Äúthose capable of deli
berate crime it might therefore according
to aristotles dictum have been affirmed of

anything contained under that class but in the
instance before us nothing is mentioned as

contained under that class only the term
√¢Äúinfant√¢Äù is excluded from that class and

though what is affirmed of a whole class may
be affirmed of anything that is contained un
der it there is no ground for supposing that it
may be denied of whatever is not so contained

for it is evidently possible that it may be appli
cable to a whole class and to something else
besides to say e g that all trees are vegeta
bles does not imply that nothing else is a vege
table

nor when it is said that all who are

capable of deliberate crime are responsible does
this imply that no others are responsible for
though this may be very true it has not been

analytical outline

 

asserted in the premiss before us and in the
analysis of an argument we are to discard all
consideration of what might be asserted con
templating only what actually is laid down in
the premises it is evident therefore that
such an apparent argument as the above does
not comply with the rule laid down nor can
be so stated as to comply with it and is con
sequently invalid

again in this instance √¢Äúfood is necessary
to life corn is food therefore corn is neces

sary to life√¢Äù the term √¢Äúnecessary to life√¢Äù is
affirmed of food but not universally for it is
not said of every kind of food the meaning of
the assertion being manifestly that some food
is necessary to life here again therefore the
rule has not been complied with since that
which has been predicated i e affirmed or
denied not of the whole but of a part only of
a certain class cannot be on that ground pre
dicated of anything whatever which is con
tained under that class

√¢ß 
the fallacy in this last case is what is
usually described in logical language as con
sisting in the √¢Äúnondistribution of the middle
term√¢Äù i e its not being employed to denote

all the objects to which it is applicable in
order to understand this phrase it is necessary



elements of logic

to observe that a proposition being an expres
sion in which one thing is affirmed or denied

distribution
of terms

of another eg √¢Äúa is b√¢Äù both that of which
something is said and that which is said of it
ie both a and b are called √¢Äúterms√¢Äù from
their being in their nature the extremes or
boundaries of the proposition and there are
of course two and but two terms in a propo
sition though it may so happen that either of
them may consist either of one word or of
several and a term is said to be √¢Äú distri
buted√¢Äù when it is taken universally so as to
stand for everything it is capable of being
applied to and consequently √¢Äúundistributed√¢Äù
when it stands for a portion only of the things

signified by it thus √¢Äúall food√¢Äù or every kind
of food are expressions which imply the dis
tribution of the term √¢Äúfood√¢Äù √¢Äú some food√¢Äù

would imply its nondistribution and it is also
to be observed that the term of which in one

premiss something is affirmed or denied and

to which in the other premiss something else
is referred as contained in it is called the

√¢Äúmiddle term in the syllogism as standing
between the other two viz the two terms of

the conclusion and being the medium of
proof now it is plain that if in each premiss
a part only of this middle term is employed

i e if it be not at all distributed no conclu
sion can be drawn

hence if in the example

analytical outline



formerly adduced it had been merely stated
that √¢Äúsomething√¢Äù not √¢Äúwhatever√¢Äù or √¢Äúevery
thing √¢Äúwhich exhibits marks of design is the
work of an intelligent author√¢Äù it would not
have followed from the worlds exhibiting
marks of design that that is the work of an
intelligent author
it is to be observed also that the words
√¢Äúall√¢Äù and √¢Äúevery√¢Äù which mark the distribu
tion of a term and √¢Äú some√¢Äù which marks its

nondistribution are not always expressed
they are frequently understood and left to be
supplied by the context eg √¢Äúfood is neces
sary√¢Äù viz √¢Äú some food√¢Äù √¢Äúman is mortal√¢Äù
viz √¢Äú every man√¢Äù propositions thus ex
pressed are called by logicians √¢Äúindefinite√¢Äù be
cause it is left undetermined by the form of the
expression whether the √¢Äúsubject√¢Äù the term
of which something is affirmed or denied being
called the √¢Äúsubject√¢Äù of the proposition and
that which is said of it the √¢Äúpredicate be
distributed or not nevertheless it is plain
that in every proposition the subject either is
or is not distributed though it be not declared
whether it is or not consequently every pro

position whether expressed indefinitely or not
must be either √¢Äúuniversal√¢Äù or √¢Äúparticular√¢Äù

those being called universal in which the pre
dicate is said of the whole of the subject or

in other words where the subject is distri



elements of logic

buted and those particular in which it is
said only of a part of the subject eg √¢Äúall
men are sinful√¢Äù is universal √¢Äú some men are

sinful√¢Äù particular and this division of propo
sitions is in logical language said to be accord
ing to their √¢Äúquantity√¢Äù

√¢∫n but the distribution or

nondistribution of

 the predicate is entirely independent of the
quantity of the proposition nor are the signs
√¢Äúall√¢Äù and √¢Äú some√¢Äù ever affixed to the predi
cate because its distribution depends upon
and is indicated by the √¢Äúquality√¢Äù of the pro
position ie its being affirmative or negative 
it being a universal rule that the predicate of
a negative proposition is distributed and of an
affirmative undistributed 

the reason of

this may easily be understood by considering
that a term which stands for a whole class may
be applied to i e affirmed of anything that

is comprehended under that class though the
term of which it is thus affirmed may be of
 the learner may perhaps be startled at being told that
the predicate of an affirmative is never distributed espe
cially as aldrich has admitted that accidentally this may
take place as in such a proposition as √¢Äúall equilateral
triangles are equiangular√¢Äù but this is not accurate he
might have said that in such a proposition as the above the
predicate is distributable but not that it is actually distri

buted i e it so happens that √¢Äúall equiangular triangles
are equilateral√¢Äù but this is not implied in the previous as
sertion and the point to be considered is not what might
be said with truth but what actually has been said

analytical outline



much narrower extent than that other and
may therefore be far from coinciding with the
whole of it thus it may be said with truth
that √¢Äúthe negroes are uncivilized√¢Äù though the
term uncivilized be of much wider extent than

√¢Äúnegroes√¢Äù comprehending besides them hot
tentots c so that it would not be allowable
to assert that √¢Äúall who are uncivilized are

negroes it is evident therefore that it is a
part only of the term √¢Äúuncivilized√¢Äù that has
been affirmed of √¢Äúnegroes√¢Äù and the same

reasoning applies to every affirmative proposi
tion for though it may so happen that the
subject and predicate coincide i e are of equal
extent as eg √¢Äúall men are rational ani

mals√¢Äù √¢Äúall equilateral triangles are equiangu
lar√¢Äù it being equally true that √¢Äúall rational
animals are men and that all equiangular tri

angles are equilateral yet this is not implied
by the form of the expression since it would be
no less true that √¢Äúall men are rational ani
mals√¢Äù even if there were other rational animals
besides man

it is plain therefore that if any part of the
predicate is applicable to the subject it may be
affirmed and of course cannot be denied of
that subject and consequently when the pre
dicate is denied of the subject it is implied that

no part of that predicate is applicable to that



elements of logic

subject i e that the whole of the predicate is
denied of the subject for to say eg that √¢Äúno

beasts of prey ruminate√¢Äù implies that beasts of
prey are excluded from the whole class of ru
minant animals and consequently that √¢Äúno
ruminant animals are beasts of prey√¢Äù and
hence results the abovementioned rule that

the distribution of the predicate is implied in

negative propositions and its nondistribution
in affirmatives

it is to be remembered therefore that it is
not sufficient for the middle term to occur in a

universal proposition since if that proposition
be an affirmative and the middle term be the
predicate of it it will not be distributed e g
if in the example formerly given it had been

merely asserted that √¢Äúall the works of an intel
ligent author shew marks of design√¢Äù and that
√¢Äúthe universe shews marks of design√¢Äù nothing
could have been proved since though both
these propositions are universal the middle

term is made the predicate in each and both
are affirmative and accordingly the rule of
aristotle is not here complied with since the
term √¢Äúwork of an intelligent author√¢Äù which is
to be proved applicable to √¢Äúthe universe√¢Äù
would not have been affirmed of the middle

term √¢Äúwhat shows marks of design under
which √¢Äúuniverse√¢Äù is contained but the middle

analytical outline



term on the contrary would have been affirmed
of it

if however one of the premises be nega
tive the middle term may then be made the
predicate of that and will thus according to
the above remark be distributed eg √¢Äú no
ruminant animals are predacious the lion is
predacious therefore the lion is not rumi
nant this is a valid syllogism and the mid

dle term predacious is distributed by being
made the predicate of a negative proposition
the form indeed of the syllogism is not that
prescribed by the dictum of aristotle but it
may easily be reduced to that form by stating
the first proposition thus √¢Äúno predacious ani
mals are ruminant which is manifestly im
plied as was above remarked in the assertion
that √¢Äúno ruminant animals are predacious√¢Äù
the syllogism will thus appear in the form to
which the dictum applies
it is not every argument indeed that can
be reduced to this form by so short and simple

an alteration as in the case before us a longer
and more complex process will often be re

quired and rules will hereafter be laid down
to facilitate this process in certain cases but
there is no sound argument but what can be
reduced into this form without at all departing

from the real meaning and drift of it and the
form will be found though more prolix than



elements of logic

is needed for ordinary use the most perspi
cuous in which an argument can be ex
hibited

all reasoning whatever then rests on the
one simple principle laid down by aristotle
that √¢Äúwhat is predicated either affirmatively
or negatively of a term distributed may be
predicated in like manner ie affirmatively or
negatively of anything contained under that
term√¢Äù so that when our object is to prove

any proposition i e to shew that one term
may rightly be affirmed or denied of another
the process which really takes place in our

minds is that we refer that term of which the
other is to be thus predicated to some class
i e middle term of which that other may be
affirmed or denied as the case may be
whatever the subject matter of an argument
may be the reasoning itself considered by it
self is in every case the same process and if

the writers against logic had kept this in mind
they would have been cautious of expressing

their contempt of what they call √¢Äúsyllogistic

reasoning√¢Äù which is in truth all reasoning
and instead of ridiculing aristotles principle
for its obviousness and simplicity would have
√¢∫

perceived that these are in fact its highest
praise the easiest shortest and most evident

theory provided it answer the purpose of ex
planation being ever the best

analytical outline



√¢ß 

if we conceive an inquirer to have reached
in his investigation of the theory of rea
soning the point to which we have now
arrived a question which would be likely next
to engage his attention is that of predication 
ie since in reasoning we are to find a middle

term which may be predicated affirmatively of
the subject in question we are led to inquire
what terms may be affirmed and what denied
of what others



it is evident that proper names or any other t√¢∫ a
terms which denote each but a single indivi
dual as √¢Äúcaesar√¢Äù √¢Äú the thames√¢Äù √¢Äúthe con
queror of pompey√¢Äù √¢Äúthis river√¢Äù hence called
in logic √¢Äúsingular terms√¢Äù cannot be affirmed
of anything besides themselves and are there

fore to be denied of anything else we may
say √¢Äúthis river is the thames√¢Äù or √¢Äúcaesar

was the conqueror of pompey√¢Äù but we can
not say of anything else that it is

the

thames

on the other hand those terms which are

called √¢Äú common√¢Äù as denoting any one indivi
dual of a whole class as √¢Äúriver√¢Äù √¢Äúconqueror√¢Äù
may of course be affirmed of any or all that

belong to that class as √¢Äúthe thames is a
river√¢Äù √¢Äú the rhine and the danube are
rivers√¢Äù

common terms therefore are called √¢Äúpre



elements of logic

dicables√¢Äù viz affirmatively predicable from
their capability of being affirmed of others a

singular term on the contrary may be the sub
ject of a proposition but never the predicate
unless it be of a negative proposition as e g
the firstborn of isaac was not jacob or un
less the subject and predicate be only two ex
pressions for the same individual object as in
some of the above instances
abstraction

and generali
zation

the process by which the mind arrives at
the notions expressed by these √¢Äúcommon or
in popular language √¢Äú general terms is

properly called generalization though it is
usually and truly said to be the business of
abstraction for generalization is one of the

purposes to which abstraction is applied when
we draw off and contemplate separately any part

of an object presented to the mind disregard
ing the rest of it we are said to abstract that
part thus a person might when a rose was
before his eyes or mind make the scent a
distinct object of attention laying aside all
thought of the colour form c and thus
even though it were the only rose he had ever
met with he would be employing the faculty
of abstraction but if in contemplating seve

ral objects and finding that they agree in
certain points we abstract the circumstances of

agreement disregarding the differences and
give to all and each of these objects a name

analytical outline



applicable to them in respect of this agreement
i e a common name as √¢Äú rose√¢Äù we are
then said to generalize abstraction there

fore does not necessarily imply generalization
though generalization implies abstraction
much needless difficulty has been raised re

specting the results of this process many
having contended and perhaps more having
taken for granted that there must be some
really existing thing√¢Äù corresponding to each
of these general or common terms and of
which such term is the name standing for and
representing it eg that as there is a really
existing being corresponding to the proper
name aetna and signified by it so the common
term √¢Äúmountain√¢Äù must have some one really ex
isting thing corresponding to it and of course
distinct from each individual mountain since
the term is not singular but common yet

existing in each since the term is applicable to
each of them √¢Äúwhen many different men√¢Äù
it is said √¢Äúare at the same time thinking or

speaking about a mountain i e not any par
ticular one but a mountain generally their
minds must be all employed on something 
which must also be one thing and not several

and yet cannot be any one individual√¢Äù and
hence a vast train of mystical disquisitions

nugatory and tend to obscure our view of
the process which actually takes place in the
mind

the fact is the notion expressed by a com
mon term is merely an inadequate or incom

plete notion of an individual and from the
very circumstance of its inadequacy it will

apply equally well to any one of several indivi
duals e g if i omit the mention and the
consideration of every circumstance which dis
tinguishes aetna from any other mountain i
then form a notion expressed by the common
term mountain which inadequately designates
aetna ie which does not imply any of its
peculiarities and is equally applicable to any
one of several other individuals

generalization it is plain may be indefi
nitely extended by a further abstraction ap
plied to common terms eg as by abstraction
from the term socrates we obtain the common

term √¢Äúphilosopher√¢Äù so from √¢Äúphilosopher√¢Äù by
a similar process we arrive at the more general
term √¢Äúman√¢Äù from √¢Äúman√¢Äù we advance to
√¢Äú animal√¢Äù c

the employment of this faculty at pleasure
has been regarded and perhaps with good rea
son as the characteristic distinction of the
human mind from that of the brutes

we

are thus enabled not only to separate and con
sider singly one part of an object presented to

analytical outline



the mind but also to fix arbitrarily upon what
ever part we please according as may suit the
purpose we happen to have in view eg any

individual person to whom we may direct our
attention may be considered either in a politi

cal point of view and accordingly referred to
the class of merchant farmer lawyer c as
the case may be or physiologically as negro
or whiteman or theologically as pagan or
christian papist or protestant or geographi
cally as european american c c and
so in respect of anything else that may be the
subject of our reasoning we arbitrarily fix
upon and abstract that point which is essential
to the purpose in hand so that the same ob
ject may be referred to various different classes
according to the occasion not of course

that we are allowed to refer anything to a class
to which it does not really belong which
would be pretending to abstract from it some
thing that was no part of it but that we ar

bitrarily fix on any part of it which we choose
to abstract from the rest it is important to
notice this because men are often disposed to

consider each object as really and properly be
longing to some one class alone√¢Äù from their
having been accustomed in the course of
their own pursuits to consider in one point of

view only things which may with equal pro
priety be considered in other points of view
also ie referred to various classes or pre
dicates and this is that which chiefly con
stitutes what is called narrowness of mind

eg a mere botanist might be astonished at
hearing such plants as clover and lucerne in
cluded in the language of a farmer under the

term √¢Äúgrasses√¢Äù which he has been accustomed
to limit to a tribe of plants widely different in all
botanical characteristics and the mere farmer

might be no less surprised to find the trouble

 some √¢Äúweed√¢Äù as he has been

accustomed to

call it known by the name of couch grass
and which he has been used to class with

nettles and thistles to which it has no botanical

affinity ranked by the botanist as a species of

wheat triticum repens and yet neither of
these classifications is in itself erroneous or
irrational though it would be absurd in a bo

tanical treatise to class plants according to
their agricultural use or in an agricultural
treatise according to the structure of their
flowers

the utility of these considerations with a

view to the present subject will be readily
estimated by recurring to the account which
has been already given of the process of rea
soning the analysis of which shews that it

consists in referring the term we are speaking

analytical outline



of to some class viz a middle term which

term again is referred to or excluded from as
the case may be another class viz the term

which we wish to affirm or deny of the subject
of the conclusion so that the quality of our
reasoning in any case must depend in our being
able correctly clearly and promptly to ab√¢Äì
stract from the subject in question that which
may furnish a middleterm suitable to the
occasion

the imperfect and irregular sketch which
has here been attempted of the logical system
may suffice even though some parts of it
should not be at once fully understood by
those who are entirely strangers to the study
to point out the general drift and purpose of
the science and to render the details of it both

more interesting and more intelligible the
analytical form which has here been adopted
is generally speaking the best suited for intro
ducing any science in the plainest and most
interesting form though the synthetical
which will henceforth be employed is the most
regular and the most compendious form for
storing it up in the memory

and which if admitted is nothing to the present purpose
our business is with argumentation and the operations of

the mind implied in that what others there may be or
whether any are irrelevant questions

the opening of a treatise with a statement respecting
the operations of the mind universally tends to foster the
prevailing error from which probably the minds of the wri

directly and completely to guard against this

degree against the others as far as can be done
by the proper use of language it is therefore
when regarded as an arth √¢Äúthe art of em
 in introducing the mention of language previously to
the definition of logic i have departed from established
practice in order that it may be clearly understood
that logic is entirely conversant about language a truth
which most writers on the subject if indeed they were

fully aware of it themselves have certainly not taken due
care to impress on their readers

aldrichs definition of

logic for instance does not give any hint of this
t it is to be observed however that as a science is con

versant about knowledge only an art is the application of
knowledge to practice hence logic as well as any other
system of knowledge becomes when applied to practice
an art while confined to the theory of reasoning it is
strictly a science and it is as such that it occupies the
higher place in point of dignity since it professes to deve
lope some of the most interesting and curious intellectual

phenomena it is surely strange therefore to find in a

synthetical compendium



ploying language properly for the purpose of
reasoning√¢Äù its importance no one can rightly
estimate who has not long and attentively con
sidered how much our thoughts are influenced
by expressions and how much error perplexity
and labour are occasioned by a faulty use of
language
a syllogism being as aforesaid resolvable
into three propositions and each proposition
containing two terms of these terms that
which is spoken of is called the subject that
which is said of it the predicate and these
two are called the terms or extremes because
logically the subject is placed first and the
predicate last and in the middle the copula
which indicates the act of judgment as by it
the predicate is affirmed or denied of the sub

ject it must be either is or is not the sub
stantive verb being the only verb recognised
by logic all others are resolvable by means

of the verb √¢Äúto be√¢Äù and a participle or adjec
tive eg √¢Äúthe romans conquered√¢Äù the word

conquered is both copula and predicate being
equivalent to √¢Äúwere cop victorious pred
treatise on logic a distinct dissertation to prove that it is
an art and not a science 

 it is proper to observe that the copula as such has

no relation to time but expresses merely the agreement or
disagreement of two given terms hence if any other
tense of the substantive verb besides the present is used
it is either to be understood as the same in sense the dif



elements of logic

√¢ß 
it is evident that a term may consist either
of one word or of several and that it is not

every word that is capable of being employed

by itself as a term eg adverbs prepositions
c and also nouns in any other case besides
the nominative a noun may be by itself a
term a verb all except the substantive verb
used as the copula is resolvable into the co

pula and predicate to which it is equivalent
and indeed is often so resolved in the mere

rendering out of one language into another
as √¢Äúipse adest√¢Äù √¢Äúhe is present√¢Äù it is to be
observed however that under √¢Äúverb we do

not include the infinitive which is properly a
nounsubstantive nor the participle which is
a nounadjective they are verbals being re
lated to their respective verbs in respect of the

things they signify but not verbs inasmuch as
they differ entirely in their mode of signification
it is worth observing that an infinitive though
it often comes last in the sentence is never the
ference of tense being regarded as a matter of grammatical
convenience only or else if the circumstance of time
really do modify the sense of the whole proposition so as
to make the use of that tense an essential then this cir

cumstance is to be regarded as a part of one of the terms
√¢Äúat that time√¢Äù or some such expression being under
stood sometimes the substantive verb is both copula and
predicate i e where existence only is predicated e g

predicate except when another infinitive is the
subject eg
sub

pred

√¢Äúi hope to succeed√¢Äù ie √¢Äúto succeed is what i hope√¢Äù

it is to be observed also that in english
there are two infinitives one in √¢Äúing√¢Äù the
same in sound and spellingas the participle
present from which however it should be care
fully distinguished eg √¢Äúrising early is health

ful√¢Äù and √¢Äúit is healthful to rise early√¢Äù are
equivalent in this and in many other cases
the english word it serves as a representative
of the subject when that is put last e g
pred

sub

√¢Äúit is to be hoped that we shall succeed√¢Äù

an adjective including participles cannot
by itself be made the subject of a proposition
but is often employed as a predicate as
√¢Äúcrassus was rich√¢Äù though some choose to
consider some substantive as understood in

every such case eg rich man and conse

quently do not reckon adjectives among simple
terms i e words which are capable singly

of being employed as terms this however
is a question of no practical consequence
 grammarians have

produced much needless perplexity

by speaking of the participle in √¢Äúing√¢Äù being employed so
and so when it is manifest that that very employment of
the word constitutes it to all intents and purposes an
infinitive and not a participle


simple
terms

elements of logic

of simpleterms then which are what the
first part of logic treats of there are many di
visions of which however one will be suffi

cient for the present purpose viz into singu
lar and common because though any term
whatever may be a subject none but a common

term can be affirmatively predicated of several
singular and others a singular term stands for one indivi
common

terms

dual as √¢Äúcaesar√¢Äù √¢Äúthe thames√¢Äù these it

is plain cannot be said or predicated affirma
tively of any thing but themselves a com
mon term stands for several individuals i e

can be applied to any of them as comprehend
ing them in its single signification as √¢Äúman√¢Äù
√¢Äúriver√¢Äù √¢Äúgreat the notions expressed by
these common terms we are enabled to form
by the faculty of abstraction for by it in con
templating any object or objects we can
attend exclusively to some particular circum

stances belonging to it some certain parts of

its nature as it were and quite withhold our
 the usual divisions of words however into univocal
equivocal and analogous and into words of the first and

second intention are not strictly speaking divisions of
words but divisions of the manner of employing them the
same word may be employed either univocally equivocally
or analogously either in the first intention or in the se
cond the ordinary logical treatises often occasion great
perplexity to the learner by not noticing this circumstance

but rather leading him to suppose the contrary√¢Äîsee ch

attention from the rest when therefore we

are thus contemplating several individuals
which resemble each other in some part of their
nature we can by attending to that part alone

and not to those points in which they differ
assign them one common name which will ex

press or stand for them merely as far as they all
agree and which of course will be applicable
to all or any of them which process is called

generalization and each of these names is √¢∫nlin
called a comi√•Ñon term from its belonging to
them all alike or a predicable because it may prelicables
be predicated affirmatively of them or of any
one of them

generalization as has been remarked im

plies abstraction but it is not the same thing
for there may be abstraction without generali
zation when we are speaking of an individual
it is usually an abstract notion that we form
eg suppose we are speaking of the present
king of france he must actually be either at
paris or elsewhere sitting standing or in
some other posture and in such and such a
dress c yet many of these circumstances
which are separable accidents vide √¢ß and
consequently which are regarded as nonessen

tial to the individual are quite disregarded by
us and we abstract from them what we con

sider as essential thus forming an abstract

yet there is here

no generalization

species

whatever term can be affirmed of several

things must express either their whole essence

which is call the species or a part of their es

to the whole species or in other words univer

synthetical compendium



it is evident from what has been said that

the genus and difference put together make up
the species eg √¢Äúrational√¢Äù and √¢Äúanimal
constitute √¢Äúman so that in reality the spe
cies contains the genus i e implies it and
when the genus is called a whole and is said
to contain the species this is only a metaphort
cal expression signifying that it comprehends
the species in its own more extensive significa
tion e g if i predicate of caesar that he is an
animal i say the truth indeed but not the whole

truth for he is not only an animal but a man
so that √¢Äúman√¢Äù is a more full and complete ex

pression than √¢Äúanimal√¢Äù which for the same
reason is more extensive as it contains or
usually reckoned such by logical writers they have also
added a fourth kind of property viz that which is pecu
liar to a species and belongs to every individual of it but
not at every time but this is in fact a contradiction since
whatever does not always belong to a species does not
belong to it universally it is through the ambiguity of
words that they have fallen into this confusion of thought
eg the example commonly given is √¢Äúhomini canescere√¢Äù
√¢Äúto become grey√¢Äù being they say though it is not pecu
liar to man and belonging to every individual though not
always but only in old age c now if by √¢Äúcanescere√¢Äù be
meant the very circumstance of becoming grey this mani
festly does not belong to every man if again it be meant
to signify the liability to become grey hereafter this does
belong always to man and the same in other instances
indeed the very proprium fixed on by aldrich √¢Äúrisibility√¢Äù
is nearly parallel to the above man is always √¢Äúcapable

of laughing√¢Äù but he is not √¢Äúcapable of laughing
always√¢Äù

rather comprehends and may be predicated of

several other species viz √¢Äúbeast√¢Äù √¢Äúbird√¢Äù c
in the same manner the name of a species is a
more extensive but less full and complete term
than that of an individual viz a singular term
since the species may be predicated of each of

√¢ß 
a genus which is also a species is called a
subaltern genus or species as √¢Äúbird√¢Äù which is
the genus of √¢Äúpigeon√¢Äù ie of which √¢Äúpigeon√¢Äù
is a species is itself a species of √¢Äúanimal√¢Äù a
genus which is not considered as a species of
anything is called summum the highest genus

a species which is not considered as a genus of
anything i e is regarded as containing under

it only individuals is called infima the lowest
species
when i say of a magnet that it is √¢Äúa kind

of ironore√¢Äù that is called its proximum genus
because it is the closest or lowest genus that
can be predicated of it √¢Äúmineral√¢Äù is its more
remote genus

synthetical compendium



when i say that the differentia of a magnet
is its √¢Äúattracting iron√¢Äù and that its property is
√¢Äúpolarity√¢Äù these are called respectively a spe
cific difference and property because magnet
is an infima species ie only a species

√¢Ä¢ 

when i say that the differentia of iron ore is
its √¢Äúcontaining iron√¢Äù and its property √¢Äúbeing
attracted by the magnet√¢Äù these are called re
spectively a generic difference and property

because iron ore is a subaltern species or genus
being both the genus of magnet and a species of
mineral

that is the most strictly called a property
which belongs to the whole of a species and to

that species alone as polarity to the magnet
and such a properly it is often hard to distin
guish from the differentia but whatever you
consider as the most essential to the nature of a

species with respect to the matter you are en
gaged in you must call the differentia as √¢Äúra

tionality√¢Äù to √¢Äúman and whatever you consi
der as rather an accompaniment or result of

that difference you must call the property as
the √¢Äúuse of speech√¢Äù seems to be a result of
rationality but very many properties which
belong to the whole of a species are not pecu
liar to it as √¢Äúto breathe air√¢Äù belongs to every
man but not to man alone and it is therefore

strictly speaking not so much a property of
the species √¢Äúman√¢Äù as of the higher i e more
f

comprehensive species which is the genus of
that viz of √¢Äúlandanimal√¢Äù other properties

as some logicians call them are peculiar to a
species but do not belong to the whole of it
eg man alone can be a poet but it is not every
man that is so

these however are more

commonly and more properly reckoned as
accidents
accidents se

parable and
inseparable

for that is most properly called an accident
which may be absent or present the essence of
the species continuing the same as for a man
to be √¢Äúwalking√¢Äù or a √¢Äúnative of paris of
these two examples the former is what logi
cians call a separable accident because it may
be separated from the individual eg he may
sit down the latter is an inseparable accident
being not separable from the individual i e
he who is a native of paris can never be other

wise √¢Äúfrom the individual√¢Äù i say because
every accident must be separable from the spe

cies else it would be a properly
 this seems to me a clearer and more correct descrip

tion of the two kinds of accident than the one given by
aldrich viz that a separable accident may be actually
separated and an inseparable only in thought √¢Äúut mantu
anum esse a virgilio√¢Äù for surely √¢Äúto be the author of
the aeneid√¢Äù was another inseparable accident of the same
individual √¢Äúto be a roman citizen√¢Äù another and √¢Äúto

live in the days of augustus√¢Äù another now can we in
thought separate all these things from the essence of that
individual to do so would be to form the idea of a different
individual we can indeed conceive a man and one who

let it here be observed that both the gene
ral name √¢Äúpredicable√¢Äù and each of the classes

of predicables viz genus species c are

relative i e we cannot say what predicable any

specified of what it is to be predicated e g
the term √¢Äúred√¢Äù would be considered a genus
in relation to the terms √¢Äúpink√¢Äù √¢Äúscarlet√¢Äù c
it might be regarded as the differentia in rela
tion to √¢Äúred rose√¢Äù√¢Äîas a property of √¢Äúblood√¢Äù
as an accident of √¢Äúa house√¢Äù c
and universally it is to be steadily kept in
mind that no √¢Äúcommon terms√¢Äù have as the

names of individuals have any real thing exist

ing in nature corresponding to them r√¢∫s r as
aristotle expresses it though he has been re
presented as the champion of the opposite opi

is merely a name denoting a certain inadequate
motion which our minds have formed of an in

dividual and which consequently not includ
ing anything wherein that individual differs

from certain others is applicable equally well

to all or any of them thus √¢Äúman√¢Äù denotes no
real thing as the sect of the realists main

merely any man viewed inadequately ie so
might chance to bear the name of virgil without any of

as to omit and abstract from all that is pecu

term becomes applicable alike to any one of
several individuals or in the plural to several

stance which we thus choose to abstract and

different
modes of
classification

consider separately disregarding all the rest
so that the same individual may thus be re
ferred to any of several different species and
the same species to several genera as suits our
purpose thus it suits the farmers purpose

to class his cattle with his ploughs carts and
other possessions under the name of √¢Äústock √¢Äù
the naturalist suitably to his purpose classes
them as √¢Äúquadrupeds√¢Äù which term would in
clude wolves deer c which to the farmer

would be a most improper classification the
commissary again would class them with corn
cheese fish c as √¢Äúprovision√¢Äù that which
is most essential in one view being subordi
mate in another

√¢ß 
division

an individual is so called because it is inca

pable of logical division which is a metapho
rical expression to signify √¢Äúthe distinct i e
separate enumeration of several things signi

fied by one common name√¢Äù this operation
is directly opposite to generalization which is
performed by means of abstraction for as in

synthetical compendium



that you lay aside the differences by which se
veral things are distinguished so as to call
them all by one common name so in division
you add on the differences so as to enumerate
them by their several particular names thus
√¢Äúmineral√¢Äù is said to be divided into √¢Äústones

metals√¢Äù c and metals again into √¢Äúgold
iron√¢Äù c and these are called the parts or
members of the division
the rules for division are three st each

of the parts or any of them short of all must
contain less ie have a narrower signification
than the thing divided d all the parts to

gether must be exactly equal to the thing di
vided therefore we must be careful to ascer
tain that the summum genus may be predicated
of every term placed under it and of nothing
else d the parts or members must be op
posed i e must not be contained in one

another e g if you were to divide √¢Äúbook√¢Äù
into √¢Äúpoetical historical folio quarto french
latin√¢Äù c the members would be contained

in each other for a french book may be a
quarto and a quarto french c you must
be careful therefore to keep in mind the prin
ciple of division with which you set out e g
whether you begin dividing books according
to their matter their language or their size

c all these being so many crossdivisions
and when anything is capable as in the



elements of logic

above instance of being divided in several dif
ferent ways we are not to reckon one of these
as the true or real or right one without spe

cifying what the object is which we have in
view for one mode of dividing may be the
most suitable for one purpose and another
for another as e g one of the above modes
of dividing books would be the most suitable
to a bookbinder another in a philosophical
and the other in a philological view

it must be carefully remembered that the
word √¢Äúdivision√¢Äù as employed in logic is as
has been observed already metaphorical for
to divide means originally and properly to se
parate the component parts of anything each
of which is of course absolutely less than the

whole e g a tree i e any individual tree
might be divided √¢Äúphysically√¢Äù as it is called
into root trunk branches leaves c

now

it cannot be said that a root or a leaf is a tree 

whereas in a logical division each of the mem

bers is in reality more than the whole e g
if you divide tree i e the genus tree into
oak elm ash c we may say of the oak or
of any individual oak that √¢Äúit is a tree√¢Äù for

by the very word √¢Äúoak√¢Äù we express not only
the general notion of a tree but more viz the

peculiar characteristic i e difference of that
kind of tree

it is plain then that it is logically only i e

t

in our mode of speaking that a genus is said
to contain or rather comprehend its species
while metaphysically i e in our conceptions
a species contains i e implies its genus
care must be taken not to confound a phy

caution is given under rule p 
√¢ß 
definition is another metaphorical word definition
which literally signifies √¢Äúlaying down a boun

separates fields

a nominal definition such

as are those usually found in a dictionary of

of the term by giving some equivalent expres

accidental definition which is commonly called

described as √¢Äúan animal that uses fire to dress

which is strictly an accident because if it does
not belong to the whole of the species it can
not define it in describing an individual on
the contrary you enumerate the accidents be
cause by them it is that one individual differs
from another and in this case you add the spe
cies eg √¢Äúphilip was a man of macedon
who subdued greece√¢Äù c individuals it is

evident can be defined in this way alone
lastly the essential definition is divided into

physical i e natural and logical or metaphysi
cal the physical definition lays down the real

parts of the essence which are actually sepa
rable the logical lays down the ideal parts of
it which cannot be separated except in the
mind thus a plant would be defined physi
cally by enumerating the leaves stalks roots

c of which it is composed logically it
would be defined √¢Äúan organized being destitute
of sensation the former of these expressions
denoting the genus the latter the difference

for a logical definition must always consist of
the genus and differentia which are the parts of

synthetical compendium



which logic considers everything as consisting
and which evidently are separable in the mind
alone

thus √¢Äúman√¢Äù is defined √¢Äúa rational

animal√¢Äù c so also a √¢Äúproposition√¢Äù might
be defined physically √¢Äúa subject and predicate
combined by a copula√¢Äù the parts here enume

rated being actually separable but logically it
would be defined √¢Äúa sentence which affirms or

denies√¢Äù and these two parts of the essence

of a proposition which are the genus and dif
ferentia of it can be separated in the mind only
and note that the difference is not always one
quality but is frequently compounded of several
together no one of which would alone suffice
definitions are divided into nominal and

real according to the object accomplished by
them whether to explain merely the mean
ing of the word or the nature of the thing on
the other hand they are divided into acci
dental physical and logical according to the

means employed by each for accomplishing their
respective objects whether it be the enume
ration of attributes or of the physical or the
metaphysical parts of the essence these

therefore are evidently two crossdivisions
in this place we are concerned with nominal

definitions only except indeed of logical
terms√¢Äù because all that is requisite for the
 the definitions of logical terms as of all terms of sci
ence strictly so called are at once nominal and real the



elements of logic

purposes of reasoning which is the proper
province of logic is that a term shall not be
used in different senses a real definition of any
thing belongs to the science or system which
is employed about that thing it is to be
noted that in mathematics the nominal and

real definition exactly coincide the meaning
of the word and the nature of the thing being
exactly the same this holds good also with

respect to logical terms most legal and many
ethical terms

it is scarcely credible how much confusion
has arisen from the ignorance of these distinc

tions which has prevailed among logical
writers√¢Äù

the principal rules for definition are three

viz st the definition must be adequate i e
neither too extensive nor too narrow for the

thing defined e g to define √¢Äúfish√¢Äù √¢Äúan ani
meaning of the word and the nature of the thing being in
this case the very same see diss ch ii √¢ß 
 in ch ii √¢ß of the concluding dissertation the doc
trine here laid down will be more fully developed

aldrich having given as an instance of a nominal defi
nition the absurd one of √¢Äúhomo qui exhumo√¢Äù has led some
to conclude that the nominal definition must be founded

on the etymology or at least that such was his meaning

but that it was not is sufficiently plain from the circum
stance that wallis from whose work his is almost entirely
abridged expressly says the contrary be this as it may
however it is plain that the etymology of a term has
nothing to do with any logical consideration of it see

note to √¢ß of ch iii

synthetical compendium



mal that lives in the water√¢Äù would be too ex

tensive because many insects c live in the
water to define it √¢Äúan animal that has an
airbladder√¢Äù would be too narrow because

many fish are without any

d the definition must be in itself plainer
than the thing defined else it would not explain
it i say √¢Äúin itself√¢Äù i e generally because
to some particular person the term defined
may happen to be even more familiar and bet
ter understood than the language of the de
finition
d it must be couched in a convenient num

ber of appropriate words if such can be found
suitable for the purpose for figurative words
which are opposed to appropriate are apt to

produce ambiguity or indistinctness too great
brevity may occasion obscurity and too great
prolicity confusion

√¢ß 

the second part of logic treats of the propo
sition which is √¢Äújudgment expressed in

excludes commands and questions √¢Äúsentence√¢Äù
being the genus and √¢Äúindicative√¢Äù the difference
this definition expresses the whole essence

and it relates entirely to the words of a propo
sition with regard to the matter its pro
perty is to be true or false hence it must not
be ambiguous for that which has more than
one meaning is in reality several propositions
nor imperfect nor ungrammatical for such an

divisions of
propositions

expression has no meaning at all
since the substance i e genus or material
part of a proposition is that it is a sentence
and since every sentence whether it be a pro
position or not may be expressed either abso

lutely√¢Äù or under an hypothesist on this we
substance

found the division of propositions according
to their substance viz into categorical and

hypothetical and as genus is said to be pre
dicated in quid what it is by the members of

this division that we answer the question what
is this proposition qua est propositio
answer categorical or hypothetical
categorical propositions are subdivided into

pure which asserts simply or purely that the
subject does or does not agree with the predi
 as √¢Äúcaesar deserved death√¢Äù √¢Äúdid caesar deserve
death p√¢Äù

f as √¢Äúif caesar was a tyrant what did he deserve√¢Äù

√¢Äúwas caesar a hero or a villain√¢Äù √¢Äúif caesar was a tyrant

cate and modal which expresses in what mode
or manner it agrees eg √¢Äúan intemperate
man will be sickly√¢Äù √¢Äúbrutus killed caesar√¢Äù

are pure √¢Äúan intemperate man will probably
be sickly√¢Äù √¢Äúbrutus killed caesar justly√¢Äù are
modal at present we speak only of pure ca
tegorical propositions
it being the differentia of a proposition that
it affirms or denies and its property to be true
or false and differentia being predicated in
quale quid property in quale we hence form
another division of propositions viz according
to their quality into affirmative and negative quality
which is the quality of the expression and
therefore in logic essential and into true and
false which is the quality of the matter and

therefore accidental an affirmative proposi
tion is one whose copula is affirmative as
√¢Äúbirds fly√¢Äù √¢Äúnot to advance is to go back√¢Äù
a negative proposition is one whose copula is
negative as √¢Äúman is not perfect√¢Äù √¢Äúno miser
is happy√¢Äù
another division of propositions is accordquantity

ing to their quantity or extent if the predi
cate is said of the whole of the subject the
proposition is universal if of a part of it only
the proposition is particular or partial e g
√¢Äúengland is an island√¢Äù √¢Äúall tyrants are
miserable√¢Äù √¢Äú no miser is rich √¢Äù are universal

propositions and their subjects are therefore



elements of logic

said to be distributed being understood to
stand each for the whole of its significates 
but √¢Äú some islands are fertile√¢Äù √¢Äúall tyrants
are not assassinated√¢Äù are particular and their

subjects consequently not distributed being
taken to stand for a part only of their signifi
cates

as every proposition must be either affirma
tive or negative and must also be either univer
sal or particular we reckon in all four kinds
of pure categorical propositions ie consi
dered as to their quantity and quality both
viz universal affirmative whose symbol used
for brevity is a universal negative e par
ticular affirmative i particular negative 
√¢ß 

when the subject of a proposition is a com
monterm the universal signs √¢Äúall no every
are used to indicate that it is distributed and

the proposition consequently is universal the
particular signs √¢Äú some c√¢Äù the contrary 

should there be no sign at all to the common
term the quantity of the proposition which is
called an indefinite proposition is ascertained
by the matter i e the nature of the connexion
between the extremes which is either neces

sary impossible or contingent
indefinites

in necessary

and in impossible matter an indefinite is un

derstood as a universal e g √¢Äúbirds have

synthetical compendium



wings i e all √¢Äúbirds are not quadrupeds√¢Äù
i e none in contingent matter i e where

the terms partly ie sometimes agree and
partly not an indefinite is understood as a par
ticular e g √¢Äúfood is necessary to life√¢Äù
ie some food √¢Äúbirds sing ie some do 
√¢Äúbirds are not carnivorous ie some are not
or all are not

as for singular propositions viz those singular
whose subject is either a proper name or a
common term with a singular sign they are
reckoned as universals see ch iv √¢ß be
cause in them we speak of the whole of the
subject eg when we say √¢Äú brutus was a
roman√¢Äù we mean the whole of brutus this

is the general rule but some singular propo
sitions inay fairly be reckoned particular i e

when some qualifying word is inserted which
indicates that you are not speaking of the whole
of the subject e g √¢Äúcaesar was not wholly a

tyrant√¢Äù √¢Äúthis man is occasionally intemper
ate√¢Äù √¢Äú non omnis moriar√¢Äù

it is evident that the subject is distributed in
every universal proposition and never in a
 it is very perplexing to the learner and needlessly so
to reckon indefinites as one class of propositions in respect
of quantity they must be either universal or particular
though it is not declared which such a mode of classifica
tion resembles that of some grammarians who among the

genders enumerate the doubtful gender



elements of logic

particular that being the very difference be
tween universal and particular propositions 
but the distribution or nondistribution of the

predicate depends not on the quantity but on
the quality of the proposition for if any part
of the predicate agrees with the subject it must

be affirmed and not denied of the subject there
fore for an affirmative proposition to be true
it is sufficient that some part of the predicate

agree with the subject and for the same rea
son for a negative to be true it is necessary
that the whole of the predicate should disagree
with the subject e g it is true that √¢Äúlearning
is useful√¢Äù though the whole of the term √¢Äúuse
ful does not agree with the term √¢Äúlearning√¢Äù
for many things are useful besides learning
but √¢Äúno vice is useful√¢Äù would be false if any
part of the term √¢Äúuseful√¢Äù agreed with the term
√¢Äúvice√¢Äù ie if you could find any one useful
thing which was a vice the two practical
rules then to be observed respecting distribu
tion are

st all universal propositions and no par
ticular distribute the subject
d all negative and no affirmative the
predicate
it may happen indeed that the whole of the
predicate in an affirmative may agree with the
subject e g it is equally true that √¢Äúall men
are rational animals√¢Äù and √¢Äúall rational animals

synthetical compendium

sl

are men but this is merely accidental and is
not at all implied in the form of expression which
alone is regarded in logic

of opposition
√¢ß 

two propositions are said to be opposed to
each other when having the same subject and
predicate they differ in quantity or quality or
both it is evident that with any given sub
ject and predicate you may state four distinct
propositions viz a e i and o any two
of which are said to be opposed hence there

are four different kinds of opposition viz st g√¢∫
the two universals a and e are called contradies

ries to each other d the two particular isisten
and o subcontraries d a and i or e and

o subalterns th a and o or e and i con
tradictories
as it is evident that the truth or falsity of

any proposition its quantity and quality being

known must depend on the matter of it we
must bear in mind that √¢Äú in necessary matter

all affirmatives are true and negatives false in
impossible matter vice versa in contingent mat
ter all universals false and particulars true√¢Äù
eg √¢Äúall islands or some islands are sur

rounded by water√¢Äù must be true because the
matter is necessary to say √¢Äúno islands or some
√¢Äî not c√¢Äù would have been false again
g



elements of logic

√¢Äúsome islands are fertile√¢Äù √¢Äú some are not fer
tile√¢Äù are both true because it is contingent
matter put √¢Äúall√¢Äù or √¢Äúno√¢Äù instead of √¢Äúsome√¢Äù
and the propositions will be false hence it
will be evident that contraries will be both false
in contingent matter but never both true sub

contraries both true in contingent matter but
never both false contradictories always one true
and the other false c with other observations

which will be immediately made on viewing
the scheme in which the four propositions are
denoted by their symbols the different kinds
of matter by the initials n i c and the truth
or falsity of each proposition in each matter

by the letter v for verum true f for falsum

mind and applying the above rule concerning
matter the learner will easily elicit all the
maxims relating to opposition as that in the

subalterns the truth of the particular which is
called the subalternate follows from the truth

of the universal subalternans and the falsity of
the universal from the falsity of the particular
that subalterns differ in quantity alone con
traries and also subcontraries in quality alone
contradictories in both and hence that if
any proposition is known to be true we infer

that its contradictory is falseif false its con
tradictory true c

of conversion
√¢ß 

a proposition is said to be converted when
its terms are transposed when nothing more is
done this is called simple conversion no con
version is employed for any logical purpose
unless it be illative i e when the truth of the

converse follows from the truth of the exposita
or proposition given e g
√¢Äúno virtuous man is a rebel therefore
no rebel is a virtuous man√¢Äù

√¢Äúsome boasters are cowards therefore
some cowards are boasters√¢Äù

conversion can then only be illative when i√•ølative cons
versions

no term is distributed in the converse which was

not distributed in the exposita for if that be
g 




elements of logic

done you will employ a term universally in the
converse which was only used partially in the
exposita hence as edistributes both terms
and i neither these propositions may be illa
tively converted in the simple manner vide
rule but as a does not distribute the pre
dicate its simple conversion would not be illa
tive eg from √¢Äúall birds are animals you
cannot infer that √¢Äúall animals are birds as
there would be a term distributed in the con

verse which was not before we must there

fore limit its quantity from universal to parti
cular and the conversion will be illative eg
√¢Äúsome animals are birds this might be fairly
named conversion by limitation but is com
conversion

 monly called √¢Äúconversion per accidens e may

per acciden

thus be converted also but in o whether the
quantity be changed or not there will still be
a term the predicate of the converse distri
buted which was not before you can therefore
only convertitillatively by changing the quality

ie considering the negative as attached to the
predicate instead of to the copula and thus regard
ing it as i one of the terms will then not be
the same as before but the proposition will be
equipollent ie convey the same meaning
eg √¢Äú some members of the university are not

learned√¢Äù you may consider √¢Äúnotlearned as
the predicate instead of √¢Äú learned √¢Äù the propo
sition will then be i and of course may be

synthetical compendium



simply converted √¢Äú some who are not learned
are members of the university√¢Äù this may

be named conversion by negation or as it is
commonly called by contraposition a may j√¢∫i
also be fairly converted in this way eg
√¢Äúevery poet is a man of genius therefore
he who is not a man of genius is not a poet√¢Äù
or √¢Äúnone but a man of genius can be a poet√¢Äù

or √¢Äúa man of genius alone can be a poet√¢Äù

for since it is the same thing to affirm some
attribute of the subject or to deny the absence

of that attribute the original proposition is
precisely equipollent to this
subj

pred


√¢Äúno

poet is notamanofgenius √¢Äù

which being e may of course be simply con
verted thus in one of these three ways every
proposition may be illatively converted viz

e i simply a o by negation a e limita
tion

note that as it was remarked that in some

affirmatives the whole of the predicate does
actually agree with the subject so when this
is the case and is granted to be so a may be
illatively converted simply but this is an ac
cidental circumstance in a just definition this
 no mention is made by aldrich of this kind of con
version but it has been thought advisable to insert it as
being in frequent use and also as being employed in this
treatise for the direct reduction of baroko and bokardo



elements of logic

is always the case for there the terms being

exactly equivalent or as they are called con
vertible terms it is no matter which is made the

subject and which the predicate eg √¢Äúa good
government is that which has the happiness of
the governed for its object√¢Äù if this be a right
definition it will follow that √¢Äúa government
which has the happiness of the governed for
its object is a good one√¢Äù most propositions
in mathematics are of this description e g
√¢Äúall equilateral triangles are equiangular√¢Äù and
√¢Äúall equiangular triangles are equilateral√¢Äù


part iiiof arguments
√¢ß 

the third operation of the mind viz reason
ing or discourse expressed in words is argu
ment and an argument stated at full length
and in its regular form is called a syllogism 
the third part of logic therefore treats of the

syllogism

every argument√¢Äù consists of two

parts that which is proced and that by
means of which it is proved the former is
called before it is proved the question when
proved the conclusion or inference that which
 i mean in the strict technical sense for in popular
use the word argument is often employed to denote the
latter of these two parts alone eg √¢Äúthis is an argument
to prove so and so √¢Äù √¢Äúthis conclusion is established by
the argument√¢Äù i e premisses

synthetical compendium



is used to prove it if stated last as is often
done in common discourse is called the reason
and is introduced by √¢Äúbecause√¢Äù or some other

causal conjunction eg √¢Äúcaesar deserved
death because he was a tyrant and all tyrants
deserve death√¢Äù

if the conclusion be stated

last which is the strict logical form to which
all reasoning may be reduced then that which

is employed to prove it is called the premises
and the conclusion is then introduced by some
illative conjunction as √¢Äútherefore√¢Äù e g
√¢Äúall tyrants deserve death
caesar was a tyrant

therefore he deserved death√¢Äùf
 both the premises together are sometimes called the
antecedent

t it may be observed that the definition here given of
an argument is in the common treatises of logic laid down
as the definition of a syllogism a word which i have con

fined to a more restricted sense there cannot evidently
be any argument whether regularly or irregularly ex
pressed to which the definition given by aldrich for in
stance would not apply so that he appears to employ
√¢Äúsyllogism√¢Äù as synonymous with √¢Äúargument√¢Äù but be
sides that it is clearer and more convenient when we have

these two words at hand to employ them in the two senses
respectively which we want to express the truth is that in
so doing i have actually conformed to aldrichs practice 
for he generally if not always employs the term syllogism
in the very sense to which i have confined it viz to de
note an argument stated in regular logical form as eg
in a part of his work omitted in the late editions in which
he is objecting to a certain pretended syllogism in the work
of another writer he says √¢Äúvalet certe argumentum syl

since then an argument is an expression in
which √¢Äúfrom something laid down and granted
as true i e the premises something else i e
the conclusion beyond this must be admitted to

be true as following necessarily or resulting
from the other and since logic is wholly con
cerned in the use of language it follows that
a syllogism which is an argument stated in a
regular logical form must be √¢Äúan argument
tefinition of
so expressed that the conclusiveness of it is

i e without considering the meaning of the

vitable whatever terms x y and z respec
tively are understood to stand for and to

this form all legitimate arguments may ulti

√¢ß 

the rule or axiom commonly called √¢Äúdictum


de omni et nulio by which aristotle proves

the validity of this argument is this √¢Äúwhat
ever is predicated of a term distributed whether
logismus tamen est falsissimus√¢Äù c now waiving the
exception that might be taken at this use of √¢Äúfalsissimus√¢Äù
nothing being strictly true or false but a proposition it is
plain that he limits the word √¢Äúsyllogism√¢Äù to the sense in

which it is here defined and is consequently inconsistent
with his own definition of it

synthetical compendium



affirmatively or negatively may be predicated in
like manner of everything contained under it√¢Äù
thus in the examples above x is predicated
of y distributed and z is contained under y
i e is its subject therefore x is predicated

of z so √¢Äúall tyrants√¢Äù c p this
rule may be ultimately applied to all arguments
and their validity ultimately rests on their
conformity thereto but it cannot be directly
and immediately applied to all even of pure ca
tegorical syllogisms for the sake of brevity
therefore some other axioms are commonly
applied in practice to avoid the occasional te

diousness of reducing all syllogisms to that
form in which aristotles dictum is applicable
we will speak first of pure categorical syllo
 instead of following aldrichs arrangement in laying
down first the canons which apply to all the figures of ca
tegorical syllogisms and then going back to the √¢Äúdictum
of aristotle√¢Äù which applies to only one of them i have
pursued what appears a simpler and more philosophical
arrangement and more likely to impress on the learners
mind a just view of the science viz st to give the rule
aristotles dictum which applies to the most clearly and
regularly constructed argument the syllogism in the first
figure to which all reasoning may be reduced then the
canons applicable to all categoricals then those belonging

to the hypotheticals and lastly to treat of the sorites which

is improperly placed by aldrich before the hypotheticals
by this plan the province of strict logic is extended as far
as it can be every kind cf argument which is of a syllo
gistic character and accordingly directly cognizable by
the rules of logic being enumerated in natural order



elements of logic

gisms and the axioms or canons by which
their validity is to be proved viz first if two
terms agree with one and the same third they
agree with each other secondly if one term

agrees and another disagrees with one and the
same third these two disagree with each other
on the former of these canons rests the va

lidity of affirmatice conclusions on the latter

of negative for no categorical syllogism can
be faulty which does not violate these canons
none correct which does hence on these two

canons are built the rules or cautions which are

to be observed with respect to syllogisms for
the purpose of ascertaining whether those
canons have been strictly observed or not
st every syllogism has three and only three
terms viz the two terms or extremes as they
are commonly called of the conclusion or
question whereof st the subject is called

the minor term nd the predicate the major
and rd the middle term with which each
of them is separately compared in order
to judge of their agreement or disagreement
with each other

if therefore there were two

middle terms the extremes or terms of the con

clusion not being both compared to the same
could not be conclusively compared to each
other

d every syllogism has three and only three
propositions viz st the major premiss in

synthetical compendium



which the major term is compared with the
middle nd the minor premiss in which the
minor term is compared with the middle and
rd the conclusion in which the minor

term is compared with the major
d note that if the middle term is ambi

guous there are in reality two middle terms in
sense though but one in sound an ambi
guous middle term is either an equivocal term
used in different senses in the two premises 
e g
√¢Äúlight is contrary to darkness
feathers are light therefore
feathers are contrary to darkness√¢Äù

or a term not distributed for as it is then

used to stand for a part only of its significates

it may happen that one of the extremes may
have been compared with one part of it and

the other with another part of it e g
√¢Äúwhite is a colour

black is a colour therefore

black is white√¢Äù√¢Äîagain
√¢Äúsome animals are beasts

some animals are birds therefore
some birds are beasts√¢Äù

the middle term therefore must be distributed
once at least in the premises ie by being

the subject of an universal or predicate of a
negative part ii √¢ß p and once is suffi



elements of logic

cient since if one extreme has been compared
to a part of the middle term and another to
the whole of it they must have been both com
pared to the same
th no term must be distributed in the con

clusion which was not distributed in one of the
premises for that which is called an illicit
process either of the major or the minor term
would be to employ the whole of a term in the

conclusion when you had employed only a
part of it in the premiss and thus in reality
to introduce a fourth term eg
√¢Äúall quadrupeds are animals
a bird is not a quadruped therefore
it is not an animal√¢Äù√¢Äîillicit process of the major

th from negative premises you can infer
nothing for in them the middle is pro
nounced to disagree with both crtremes not to
agree with both or to agree with one and
disagree with the other therefore they cannot
be compared together e g
√¢Äúa fish is not a quadruped√¢Äù
√¢Äúa bird is not a quadruped√¢Äù proves nothing

th if one premiss be negative the conclu
sion must be negative for in that premiss the
middle term is pronounced to disagree with
one of the extremes and in the other premiss

which of course is affirmative by the preceding

synthetical compendium



rule to agree with the other extreme there
fore the extremes disagreeing with each other
the conclusion is negative in the same man
ner it may be shown that to prove a negative
conclusion one of the premises must be a nega
tive

by these six rules all syllogisms are to be
tried and from them it will be evident st
that nothing can be proved from two particular

premises for you will then have either the
middle term undistributed or an illicit process 
 

√¢Äúsome animals are sagacious
some beasts are not sagacious
some beasts are not animals√¢Äù

and for the same reason ndly that if one
of the premises be particular the conclusion
must be particular e g
√¢Äúall who fight bravely deserve reward

some soldiers fight bravely√¢Äù you can only infer
that √¢Äúsome soldiers deserve reward√¢Äù

for to infer a universal conclusion would
 aldrich has given twelve rules which i found might
more conveniently be reduced to six no syllogism can
be faulty which violates none of these six rules it is
much less perplexing to a learner not to lay down as a
distinct rule that eg against particular premises which
is properly a result of the foregoing since a syllogism
with two particular premises would offend against either
r or r 



elements of logic

be an illicit process of the minor but from
two universal premises you cannot always
infer a universal conclusion eg
√¢Äúall gold is precious
all gold is a mineral therefore

some mineral is precious√¢Äù

and even when we can infer a universal we

are always at liberty to infer a particular since
what is predicated of all may of course be predi
cated of some

of moods
√¢ß 

when we designate the three propositions
of a syllogism in their order according to their
respective quantity and quality i e their sym
bols we are said to determine the mood of the
syllogism e g the example just above √¢Äúall
gold c is in the mood a a i as there
are four kinds of propositions and three pro

positions in each syllogism all the possible
ways of combining these four a e i o by
threes are sixtyfour for any one of these
four may be the major premiss each of these
four majors may have four different minors
 aldrich by a strange oversight has so expressed
himself as to imply though he could hardly mean it that
we always may if we will infer a universal conclusion for
two universal premises

and of these sixteen pairs of premises each may
have four different conclusions x 
x 

this is a mere arithmetical cal

culation of the moods without any regard to
the logical rules for many of these moods are
inadmissable in practice from violating some
of those rules eg the mood e e e must

be rejected as having negative premises i o

the same faults by examination then of all
it will be found that of the sixtyfour there

tuation of the middle term with respect to the
extremes of the conclusion ie the major and
minor term when the middle term is made

the subject of the major premiss and the predicate
of the minor that is called the first figure

which is far the most natural and clear of all

as to this alone aristotles dictum may be at
once applied in the second figure the middle
term is the predicate of both premises in the

third the subject of both in the fourth the pre

dicate of the major premiss and the subject of

elements of logic


√¢∫

the minor this is the most awkward and
unnatural of all being the very reverse of the
first note that the proper order is to place
the major premiss first and the minor second 
but this does not constitute the major and minor
premises for that premiss wherever placed
is the major which contains the major term and

the minor the minor v r p each
of the allowable moods mentioned above will

not be allowable in every figure since it may
violate some of the foregoing rules in one
figure though not in another e g i a i
is an allowable mood in the third figure but in
the first it would have an undistributed middle

so a e e would in the first figure have an
illicit process of the major but is allowable in
the second and a a a which in the first

figure is allowable would in the third have an
illicit process of the minor all which may be
ascertained by trying the different moods in
each figure as per scheme

the terms alone being here stated the quan

quently the mood of the whole syllogism is

left to be filled up ie betwen y and x we
may place either a negative or affirmative co
pula and we may prefix either a universal or

then to each figure it will be found that each

is part of ciceros argument in off third book
but it is an inverted and clumsy way of stating

what would much more naturally fall into the
first figure for if you examine the proposi
tions of a syllogism in the fourth figure be
ginning at the conclusion you will see that as

the major term is predicated of the minor so
is the minor of the middle and that again of
the major so that the major appears to be
merely predicated of itself hence the five
moods in this figure are seldom or never used
some one of the fourteen moods with names in


the first three figures being the forms into

synthetical compendium



which all arguments may most readily be
thrown but of these the four in the first figure
are the clearest and most natural as to them

aristotles dictum will immediately apply and
as it is on this dictum that all reasoning ulti

mately depends so all arguments may be some
how or other brought into some one of these
four moods and a syllogism is in that case
said to be reduced i e to the first figure
these four are called the perfect moods and
all the rest imperfect
ostensive reduction

√¢ß 

in reducing a syllogism we are not of
course allowed to introduce any new term or
proposition having nothing granted but the
truth of the premises but these premises are

allowed to be illatively converted because the

truth of any proposition implies that of its illa
tive converse or transposed by taking advan
tage of this liberty where there is need we
deduce in figure st from the premises ori

the original one or another from which the
original conclusion follows by illative con

and the rest of the syllogism remains the
same only that the minor premiss must be
considered as affirmative because you take

in the same manner bokardo√¢Äù to darii e g

sion will be the converse by negation of the ori

ginal one which therefore may be inferred from
it e g
√¢Äúall slaves are wronged



some who are not discontented are slaves

some who are not discontented are wronged√¢Äù

in these ways by what is called ostensive
reduction because you prove in the first figure

either the very same conclusion as before or

one which implies it all the imperfect moods
may be reduced to the four perfect ones but
there is also another way called
reductio ad impossibile
√¢ß 

by which we prove in the first figure not
directly that the original conclusion is true but
 or dokamo



elements of logic

that it cannot be false i e that an absurdity
would follow from the supposition of its being
false e g
√¢Äúall true patriots are friends to religion
some great statesmen are not friends to religion
some great statesmen are not true patriots√¢Äù

if this conclusion be not true its contradic

tory must be true viz
√¢Äúall great statesmen are true patriots√¢Äù

let this then be assumed in the place of the

minor premiss of the original syllogism and a
false conclusion will be proved eg bar
√¢Äúall true patriots are friends to religion
ba all great statesmen are true patriots
ra all great statesmen are friends to religion √¢Äù

for as this conclusion is the contradictory of
the original minor premiss it must be false
since the premises are always supposed to be
granted therefore one of the premises by
which it has been correctly proved must be
false also but the major premiss being one
of those originally granted is true therefore
the falsily must be in the minor premiss which

is the contradictory of the original conclusion
therefore the original conclusion must be
true

this is the

indirect mode of rea

√¢ß 

this kind of reduction is seldom employed
but for baroko and bokardo which are thus

reduced by those who confine themselves to

simple conversion and conversion by limita
tion per accidens and they framed the names
of their moods with a view to point out the
manner in which each is to be reduced viz b
c d f which are the initial letters of all the

moods indicate to which mood of the first
figure barbara celarent darii and ferio
each of the others is to be reduced m indicates

that the premises are to be transposed s and p
that the proposition denoted by the vowel im
mediately preceding is to be converted s sim

ply p per accidens by limitation thus in
camestres see example p the c indi
cates that it must be reduced to celarent the

two ss that the minor premiss and conclusion

must be converted simply the m that the pre
mises must be transposed k which indicates
the reduction ad impossibile is a sign that the

proposition denoted by the vowel immediately
before it must be left out and the contradic

tory of the conclusion substituted viz for the
minor premiss in baroko and the major in bo
kardo but it has been already shown that the

conversion by contraposition by negation



elements of logic

will enable us to reduce these two moods os

tensively

supplement to part iiiof modal syllogisms
and of all arguments besides regular and pure
categorical syllogisms
qf modals

√¢ß 
hitherto we have treated of pure categorical

propositions

and the

syllogisms composed of
such a modal proposition may be stated as
a pure one by attaching the mode to one of the

terms and the proposition will in all respects
fall under the foregoing rules e g √¢Äújohn

killed thomas wilfully and maliciously√¢Äù here
the mode is to be regarded as part of the pre

dicate √¢Äúit is probable that all knowledge is
useful√¢Äù √¢Äúprobablyuseful is here the predi
cate but when the mode is only used to ex
press the necessary contingent or impossible
connection of the terms it may as well be at
tached to the subject eg √¢Äúman is necessarily
mortal√¢Äù is the same as √¢Äúall men are mortal√¢Äù
 if any one should choose that the names of these
moods should indicate this he might make k the index of
conversion by negation and then the names would be by

a hypothetical proposition is defined to be
two or more categoricals united by a copula or

conjunction and the different kinds of hypo
thetical propositions are named from their
respective conjunctions viz conditional dis
junctive causal c





when a hypothetical conclusion is inferred
from a hypothetical premiss so that the force
of the reasoning does not turn on the hypo
thesis then the hypothesis as in modals
must be considered as part of one of the terms

but when the reasoning itself rests on the
hypothesis in which way a categorical con

premiss this is what is called a hypothetical
syllogism and rules have been devised for
ascertaining the validity of such arguments
at once without bringing them into the cate

gorical form and note that in these syllo
gisms the hypothetical premiss is called the

synthetical compendium



major and the categorical one the minor
they are of two kinds conditional and dis
junctive
of conditionals
√¢ß 

a conditional proposition has in it an illative
jorce i e it contains two and only two cate
gorical propositions whereof one results from
the other or follows from it e g
antecedent

√¢Äúif the scriptures are not wholly false
consequent

they are entitled to respect√¢Äù

that from which the other results is called the
antecedent that which results from it the con
sequent consequens and the connection be
tween the two expressed by the word √¢Äúif√¢Äù
the consequence consequentia the natural
order is that the antecedent should come

before the consequent but this is frequently
reversed eg √¢Äúthe husbandman is well off if

he knows his own advantages virg geor
and note that the truth or falsity of a condi
tional proposition depends entirely on the
consequence eg √¢Äúif logic is useless it de
serves to be neglected here both antecedent

and consequent are false yet the whole pro
position is true ie it is true that the conse



elements of logic

quent follows from the antecedent √¢Äúif
cromwell was an englishman he was an

usurper√¢Äù is just the reverse case for though
it is true that √¢Äúcromwell was an english
man√¢Äù and also that √¢Äúhe was an usurper yet
it is not true that the latter of these proposi

tions depends on the former the whole pro
position therefore is false though both ante

cedent and consequent are true a condi
tional proposition in short may be considered
as an assertion of the validity of a certain

argument since to assert that an argument is
valid is to assert that the conclusion necessa

rily results from the premises whether those
premises be true or not

the meaning then of a conditional propo
sition is this that the antecedent being granted
the consequent is granted which may be con
sidered in two points of view first if the
antecedent be true the consequent must be
true hence the first rule the antecedent being
granted the consequent may be inferred second
ly if the antecedent were true the consequent
would be true hence the second rule the con

sequent being denied the antecedent may be de
nied for the antecedent must in that case be

false since if it were true the consequent
which is granted to be false would be true
also eg √¢Äúif this man has a fever he is sick√¢Äù

here if you grant the antecedent the first rule

synthetical compendium



applies and you infer the truth of the conse
quent √¢Äúhe has a fever therefore he is sick√¢Äù
if a is b c is d but a is b therefore c is
d and this is called a constructive conditional

syllogism but if you deny the consequent i e
grant its contradictory the second rule applies

and you infer the contradictory of the antecedent
√¢Äúhe is not sick therefore he has not a fever√¢Äù

this is the destructive conditional syllogism
if a is b c is d c is not d therefore a is
not b again √¢Äúif the crops are not bad
corn must be cheap√¢Äù for a major then √¢Äúbut
the crops are not bad therefore corn must be
cheap√¢Äù is constructive √¢Äúcorn is not cheap
therefore the crops are bad√¢Äù is destructive
√¢Äúif every increase of population is desirable
some misery is desirable but no misery is
desirable therefore some increase of popula
tion is not desirable√¢Äù is destructive

but if

you affirm the consequent or deny the antecedent
you can infer nothing for the same conse
quent may follow from other antecedents eg
in the example above a man may be sick from
other disorders besides a fever therefore it

does not follow from his being sick that he
has a fever nor for the same reason from
his not having a fever that he is not sick
there are therefore two and only two kinds
of conditional syllogisms the constructive
founded on the first rule and answering to



elements of logic

direct reasoning and the destructive on the
second answering to indirect
and note that a conditional proposition

may like the categorical a be converted by
negation ie you may take the contradictory
of the consequent as an antecedent and the con
tradictory of the antecedent as a consequent eg
√¢Äúif this man is not sick he has not a fever√¢Äù

by this conversion of the major premiss a

constructive syllogism may be reduced to a
destructive and vice vers√£§ see √¢ß ch iv

√¢∫

of disjunctives
√¢ß 

a disjunctive proposition may consist of
any number of categoricals and of these
some one at least must be true or the whole

proposition will be false if therefore one or
more of these categoricals be denied i e grant
ed to be false you may infer that the remain
ing one or if several some one of the remain
ing ones is true eg √¢Äúeither the earth is
eternal or the work of chance or the work of
an intelligent being it is not eternal nor the
work of chance therefore it is the work of

an intelligent being√¢Äù √¢Äúit is either spring
summer autumn or winter but it is neither

spring nor summer therefore it is either

synthetical compendium

autumn or winter√¢Äù



either a is b or c is d

but a is not b therefore c is d

note that

in these examples as well as very many others
it is implied not only that one of the members
the categorical propositions must be true

but that only one can be true so that in such
cases if one or more members be affirmed the
rest may be denied the members may then

be called exclusive eg √¢Äúit is summer there
fore it is neither spring autumn nor winter
√¢Äúeither a is b or c is d but a is b there

fore c is not d√¢Äù but this is by no means
universally the case e g √¢Äúvirtue tends to
procure us either the esteem of mankind or
the favour of god√¢Äù here both members are

true and consequently from one being affirmed
we are not authorized to deny the other
it is evident that a disjunctive syllogism may
easily be reduced to a conditional e g if it
is not spring or summer it is either autumn
or winter c

the dilemma√¢Äù
√¢ß 

is a complex kind of conditional syllogism
st if you have in the major premiss sere
ral antecedents all with the same consequent
 the account usually given of the dilemma in logical
treatises is singularly perplexed and unscientific aldrich
in speaking of it abstains from all use of logical terms and
i



elements of logic

then these antecedents being in the minor
disjunctively granted i e it being granted that
some one of them is true the one common con

sequent may be inferred as in the case of a
simple constructive syllogism eg if a is b
c is d and if x is y c is d but either a is
b or x is y therefore c is d √¢Äúif the blest

in heaven have no desires they will be perfectly
content so they will if their desires are fully
gratified but either they will have no desires
di or have them fully gratified therefore they
will be perfectly content√¢Äù note in this case
the two conditionals which make up the major

simple con
structive
lemma

premiss may be united in one proposition by
means of the word √¢Äúwhether√¢Äù eg √¢Äúwhether
the blest c have no desires or have their
desires gratified they will be content√¢Äù
complex con
structive di
lemma

d but if the several antecedents have each

a different consequent then the antecedents

being as before disjunctively granted you can
speaks in a loose vague and rhetorical manner and it
is remarkable that all the rules he gives respecting it and
the faults against which he cautions us relate exclusively
to the subject matter as if one were to lay down as rules
respecting a syllogism in barbara √¢Äúst care must be
taken that the major premiss be true dly that the minor
premiss be true √¢Äù

most if not all writers on this point either omit to tell
us whether the dilemma is a kind of conditional or of

disjunctive argument or else refer it to the latter class on

account of its having one disjunctive premiss though it
clearly belongs to the class of conditionals

synthetical compendium



only disjunctively infer the consequents e g
if a is b c is d and if x is y e is f but
either a is b or x is y therefore either c is

d or e is f √¢Äúif aeschines joined in the
public rejoicings he is inconsistent if he did
not he is unpatriotic but he either joined or
not therefore he is either inconsistent or un
patriotic√¢Äù demost for the crown this

case as well as the foregoing is evidently con
structive

in the destructive form whether you have
one antecedent with several consequents or
several antecedents either with one or with

several consequents in all these cases if you
deny the whole of the consequent or conse
quents you may in the conclusion deny the
whole of the antecedent or antecedents e g
√¢Äúif the world were eternal the most useful arts

such as printing c would be of unknown
antiquity and on the same supposition there

would be records long prior to the mosaic
and likewise the sea and land in all parts of

the globe might be expected to maintain the
same relative situations now as formerly but
none of these is the fact therefore the world

is not eternal√¢Äù again √¢Äúif the world existed
from eternity there would be records prior to

it would not bear marks of design there are

no records prior to the mosaic and the world
i

does bear marks of design therefore it neither

existed from eternity nor is the work of
chance√¢Äù these are commonly called dilem
mas but hardly differ from simple conditional

syllogisms nor is the case different if you
have one antecedent with several consequents
which consequents you disjunctively deny for
that comes to the same thing as wholly denying
them since if they be not all true the one an
tecedent must equally fall to the ground and
the syllogism will be equally simple e g√¢Äù √¢Äúif
we are at peace with france by virtue of the
treaty of paris we must acknowledge the
sovereignty of buonaparte and also we must
acknowledge that of louis but we cannot do

both of these therefore we are not at peace√¢Äù
c which is evidently a plain destructive

the true dilemma is √¢Äúa conditional syllogism
with several antecedents in the major and a dis
junctive minor√¢Äù hence
destructive
dilemma

d that is most properly called a destruc
tive dilemma which has like the constructive

ones a disjunctive minor premiss i e when you
have several antecedents with each a different

consequent which consequents instead of

wholly denying them as in the case lately men
tioned you disjunctively deny and thence in
the conclusion deny disjunctively the antece

dents eg if a is b c is d and if x is y

synthetical compendium



e is f but either c is not d or e is not f
therefore either a is not b or x is not y
√¢Äúif this man were wise he would not speak

irreverently of scripture injest and if he were
good he would not do so in earnest but he
does it either in jest or earnest therefore he
is either not wise or not good√¢Äù

every dilemma may be reduced into two or √¢∫f
more simple conditional syllogisms eg √¢Äúif
aeschines joined c he is inconsistent he
did join c therefore he is inconsistent and
again if aeschines did not join c he is un
patriotic he did not c therefore he is unpa
triotic√¢Äù now an opponent might deny either
of the minor premises in the above syllogisms
but he could not deny both and therefore he
must admit one or the other of the conclu

sions for when a dilemma is employed it is
supposed that some one of the antecedents must
be true or in the destructive kind some one

of the consequents false but that we cannot
tell which of them is so and this is the reason

why the argument is stated in the form of a
dilemma

from what has been said it may easily be
seen that all dilemmas are in fact conditional

syllogisms and that disjunctive syllogisms may
also be reduced to the form of conditionals

but as it has been remarked that all reasoning

whatever may ultimately be brought to the one

iis

elements of logic

test of aristotles √¢Äúdictum√¢Äù it remains to show

how a conditional syllogism may be thrown
into such a form that that test will at once

apply to it and this is called the
reduction of hypotheticals√¢Äù
√¢ß 

for this purpose we must consider every
conditional proposition as a universal affirma
 aldrich has stated through a mistake that aristotle
utterly despised hypothetical syllogisms and thence made
no mention of them but he did indicate his intention to

treat of them in some part of his work which either was not

completed by him according to his design or else in com
mon with many of his writings has not come down to us
aldrich observes that no hypothetical argument is valid
which cannot be reduced to a categorical form and this is
evidently agreeable to what has been said at the beginning

of this part but then he has unfortunately omitted to teach
us how to reduce hypotheticals to this form except in the
case where the antecedent and consequent chance to have
each the same subjects in which case he tells us to take the

minor premiss and conclusion as an enthymeme and fill
that up categorically eg √¢Äúif caesar was a tyrant he
deserved death he was a tyrant therefore he deserved
death√¢Äù which may easily be reduced to a categorical
form by taking as a major premiss √¢Äúall tyrants deserve
death√¢Äù

but when as is often the case the antecedent

and consequent have not each the same subject as in the
very example he gives √¢Äúif a is b c is d√¢Äù he gives no
rule for reducing such a syllogism as has a premiss of this
kind and indeed leads us to suppose that it is to be re
jected as invalid though he has just before demonstrated
its validity and this is likely to have been one among
the various causes which occasion many learners to regard
the whole system of logic as a string of idle reveries hav
ing nothing true substantial or practically useful in it

tive categorical proposition of which the
terms are entire

propositions viz the antece

dent answering to the subject and the conse

is a good king france is likely to prosper√¢Äù is
equivalent to saying √¢Äúthe case of louis being
a good king is a case of france being likely


to prosper√¢Äù and if it be granted as a minor

premiss to the conditional syllogism that
√¢Äúlouis is a good king√¢Äù that is equivalent to
saying √¢Äúthe present case is the case of louis
being a good king from which you will draw
a conclusion in barbara viz √¢Äú the present
case is a case of france being likely to pro
sper√¢Äù exactly equivalent to the original con
clusion of the conditional syllogism viz
√¢Äúfrance is likely to prosper√¢Äù as the con
structive conditional may thus be reduced to
barbara so may the destructive in like man

pain is no evil but pain is an evil therefore
the stoics are not right is equivalent to√¢Äî
but of the same character with the dreams of alchymy
demonology and judicial astrology such a mistake is
surely the less inexcusable in a learner when his master first
demonstrates the validity of a certain argument and then tells
him that after all it is good for nothing prorsus repu

diandum in the late editions of aldrichs logic all
that he says of the reduction of hypotheticals is omitted
which certainly would have been an improvement if a
more correct one had been substituted but as it is there

is a complete hiatus in the system

√¢Äú the case of the stoics being right is the case
of pain being no evil the present case is not

the case of pain being no evil therefore the
present case is not the case of the stoics being
right√¢Äù this is camestres which of course is
easily reduced to celarent or if you will all
conditional syllogisms may be reduced to bar

which may be done as mentioned above by
converting by negation the major premiss

the reduction of hypotheticals may always
be effected in the manner above stated but as

it produces a circuitous awkwardness of ex

cases be substituted e g in the example
above it may be convenient to take √¢Äútrue
for one of the terms √¢Äúthat pain is no evil is
not true that pain is no evil is asserted by the
stoics therefore something asserted by the
stoics is not true√¢Äù sometimes again it may

be better to unfold the argument into two syl
logisms e g in a former example first
√¢Äúlouis is a good king the governor of france
is louis therefore the governor of france is
a good king√¢Äù and then second √¢Äúevery
country governed by a good king is likely to
prosper√¢Äù c a dilemma is generally to be
reduced into two or more categorical syllo

gisms and when the antecedent and conse

quent have each the same subject you may
sometimes reduce the conditional by merely
substituting a categorical major premiss for the
conditional one eg instead of √¢Äúif caesar was
a tyrant he deserved death he was a tyrant

therefore he deserved death√¢Äù you may put for
a major √¢Äúall tyrants deserve death√¢Äù c but
it is of no great consequence whether hypo
theticals are reduced in the most meat and con

cise manner or not since it is not intended

that they should be reduced to categoricals in
ordinary practice as the readiest way of trying
their validity their own rules being quite suf
ficient for that purpose but only that we
should be able if required to subject any argu
ment whatever to the test of aristotles dic

tum in order to show that all reasoning turns
upon one simple principle

√¢ß 

there are various abridged forms of argu
ment which may be easily expanded into regu
lar syllogisms such as



st the enthymeme which is a sylloeatermen
gism with one premiss suppressed as all
the terms will be found in the remaining pre
miss and conclusion it will be easy to fill up

the syllogism by supplying the premiss that is
wanting whether major or minor

√¢Äúcaesar was a tyrant therefore he deserved

be filled up hypothetically

which the conclusion of each is made the pre

ultimate conclusion of all you may sometimes
sorites

state these briefly in a form called sorites in

which the predicate of the first proposition is
made the subject of the next and so on to
any length till finally the predicate of the last

b is c c is d d is e therefore a is e
√¢Äúthe english are a brave people a brave peo
ple are free a free people are happy there
fore the english are happy√¢Äù a sorites then
has as many middle terms as there are inter

mediate propositions between the first and the

last and consequently it may be drawn out
into as many separate syllogisms of which the
 it is to be observed that the enthymeme is not syllo
gistic ie its conclusiveness is not apparent from the mere
form of expression without regard to the meaning of the
terms because it is from that we form our judgment as to
the truth of the suppressed premiss the sorites on the
other hand is strictly syllogistic as may be seen by the
examples

first will have for its major premiss the se

sitions of the sorites as may be seen by the

it is also evident that in a sorites

you cannot have more than one negative pro
position and one particular for else one of

the syllogisms would have its premises both
negative or both particular vide p

rhetorical distinctions and have wandered from

c as distinct forms of argument for when
thrown into the syllogistic form and when let

to call for explanation as where one of the

th and many syllogisms which at first i√¢∫n

consequently to be reducible to a regular

there will be no fault in the reasoning only

an irregularity in the expression e g √¢Äúno
irrational agent could produce a work which
manifests design the universe is a work which
manifests design therefore no irrational agent

could have produced the universe√¢Äù strictly
speaking this syllogism has five terms but
if you look to the meaning you will see that
in the first premiss considering it as a part of
this argument it is not properly √¢Äúan irra

which you predicate that it could not produce

a work manifesting design but rather it is
this √¢Äúwork√¢Äù c of which you are speaking
and of which it is predicated that it could not
be produced by an irrational agent if then you
state the propositions in that form the syllo

thus such a syllogism as this √¢Äúevery true

again √¢Äúnone but candid men are good rea
soners few infidels are candid few infidels

are good reasoners in this it will be most
convenient to consider the major premiss

as being √¢Äú all good reasoners are candid
which of course is precisely equipollent to its

illative converse by negation and the minor
premiss and conclusion may in like manner be
fairly expressed thus√¢Äî√¢Äúmost infidels are not

the foregoing rules enable us to develope mi√¢∫

the principles on which all reasoning is con √¢Äú√¢Äù

and to ascertain the validity or fallaciousness
of any apparent argument as far as the form
of expression is concerned that being alone the
proper province of logic



elements of logic

but it is evident that we may nevertheless
remain liable to be deceived or perplexed in

argument by the assumption of false or doubt
ful premises or by the employment of indistinct
or ambiguous terms and accordingly many
logical writers wishing to make their systems
appear as perfect as possible have undertaken
to give rules √¢Äúfor attaining clear ideas√¢Äù and

for √¢Äúguiding the judgment√¢Äù and fancying or
professing themselves successful in this have
consistently enough denominated logic the
√¢Äúart of using the reason√¢Äù which in truth it
would be and would supersede all other studies
if it could of itself ascertain the meaning of every

term and the truth or falsity of every propo
sition in the same manner as it actually can
the validity of every argument and they have
been led into this partly by the consideration
that logic is concerned about the three opera
tions of the mind√¢Äîsimple apprehension judg

ment and reasoning not observing that it is
not equally concerned about all the last
operation being alone its appropriate province

and the rest being treated of only in reference
to that

the contempt justly due to such pretensions
has most unjustly fallen on the science itself
much in the same manner as chemistry was

brought into disrepute among the unthinking

synthetical compendium



by the extravagant pretensions of the alchy
mists and those logical writers have been
censured not as they should have been for
making such professions but for not fulfilling
them it has been objected especially that the
rules of logic leave us still at a loss as to the

most important and difficult point in reason
ing viz the ascertaining the sense of the terms
employed and removing their ambiguity a
complaint resembling that made according to
a story told by warburton in his div leg
and before alluded to by a man who found
fault with all the readingglasses presented to

him by the shopkeeper the fact being that
he had never learnt to read

in the present

case the complaint is the more unreasonable
inasmuch as there neither is nor ever can possi
bly be any such system devised as will effect
the proposed object of clearing up the ambi
guity of terms it is however no small ad
vantage that the rules of logic though they
cannot alone ascertain and clear up ambiguity

in any term yet do point out in which term
of an argument it is to be sought for direct
ing our attention to the middle term as the
one on the ambiguity of which a fallacy is
likely to be built

it will be useful however to class and de
scribe the different kinds of ambiguity which
are to be met with and also the various ways
k



elements of logic

in which the insertion of false or at least
unduly assumed premises is most likely to

elude observation and though the remarks

which will be offered on these points may not
be considered as strictly forming a part of

logic they cannot be thought out of place
when it is considered how essentially they are
connected with the application of it

introduction

by a fallacy is commonly understood √¢Äúany √¢∫n
√¢∫f
y
unsound mode of arguing which appears to
demandour conviction and to be decisive of the
question in hand when in fairness it is not√¢Äù

considering the ready detection and clear expo
sure of fallacies to be both more extensivelyim
portant and also more difficult than many are
aware of we propose to take a logical view

of the subject referring the different fallacies
to the most convenient heads and giving a
scientific analysis of the procedure which takes
place in each

after all indeed in the practical detection
of each individual fallacy much must depend
on natural and acquired acuteness nor can
any rules be given the mere learning of which
will enable us to apply them with mechanical
certainty and readiness but still we shall find
that to take correct general views of the sub
ject and to be familiarized with scientific dis
cussions of it will tend above all things to
k 



elements of logic

engender such a habit of mind as will best fit us
for practice
indeed the case is the same with respect to
logic in general scarcely any one would in

ordinary practice state to himself either his
own or anothers reasoning in syllogisms in
barbara at full length yet a familiarity with

logical principles tends very much as all
feel who are really well acquainted with them
to beget a habit of clear and sound reasoning
the truth is in this as in many other things
there are processes going on in the mind when
we are practising anything quite familiar to
us with such rapidity as to leave no trace in
the memory and we often apply principles
which did not as far as we are conscious even
occur to us at the time
inaccurate

language of

it would be foreign however to the present

former wri
ters

purpose to investigate fully the manner in

which certain studies operate in remotely pro
ducing certain effects on the mind it is suffi
cient to establish the fact that habits of scien

tific analysis besides the intrinsic beauty and
dignity of such studies lead to practical ad
vantage it is on logical principles therefore
that we propose to discuss the subject of fal
lacies and it may indeed seem to have been
unnecessary to make any apology for so doing
after what has been formerly said generally
in defence of logic but that the generality of

of eallacies



logical writers have usually followed so op
posite a plan whenever they have to treat of
anything that is beyond the mere elements of
logic they totally lay aside all reference to
the principles they have been occupied in esta
blishing and explaining and have recourse to

a loose vague and popular kind of language
such as would be the best suited indeed to an

exoterical discourse but seems strangely incon
gruous in a professed logical treatise what
should we think of a geometrical writer who
after having gone through the elements with
strict definitions and demonstrations should

on proceeding to mechanics totally lay aside all
reference to scientific principles all use of
technical terms and treat of the subject in
undefined terms and with probable and popu

lar arguments

it would be thought strange

if even a botanist when addressing those whom

he had been instructing in the principles and
the terms of his system should totally lay these
aside when he came to describe plants and

adopt the language of the vulgar surely it
affords but too much plausibility to the cavils
of those who scoff at logic altogether that the

very writers who profess to teach it should
never themselves make any application of or

reference to its principles on those very occa
sions when and when only such application
and reference are to be expected if the prin



elements of logic

ciples of any system are well laid down if its
technical language is judiciously framed
then surely those principles and that language
will afford for those who have once tho

roughly learned them the best the most clear
simple and concise method of treating any
subject connected with that system yet even
the accurate aldrich in treating of the di
lemma and of the fallacies has very much for

gotten the logician and assumed a loose and
rhetorical style of writing without making any
application of the principles he had formerly
laid down but on the contrary sometimes de

parting widely from them
the most experienced teachers when ad

dressing those who are familiar with the ele
mentary principles of logic think it requisite
not indeed to lead them on each occasion

through the whole detail of those principles
when the process is quite obvious but always
to put them on the road as it were to those

principles that they may plainly see their own
 he is far more confused in his discussion of fallacies

than in any other part of his treatise of which this one
instance may serve after having distinguished fallacies
into those in the expression and those in the matter √¢Äú in

dictione√¢Äù and √¢Äúextra dictionem√¢Äù he observes of one or
two of these last that they are not properly called falla
cies as not being syllogisms faulty in form √¢Äúsyllogismi
forma peccantes√¢Äù as if any one which was such could be

way to the end and take a scientific view of
the subject in the same manner as mathema
tical writers avoid indeed the occasional te

diousness of going all through a very simple
demonstration which the learner if he will
may easily supply but yet always speak in
strict mathematical language and with refer

ence to mathematical principles though they
do not always state them at full length i
would not profess therefore any more than

they do to write on subjects connected with
the science in a language intelligible to those
who are ignorant of its first rudiments to do
so indeed would imply that one was not tak

ing a scientific view of the subject nor availing
onesself of the principles that had been esta
blished and the accurate and concise technical

language that had been framed
√¢ß 

the division of fallacies into those in the p√¢∫√¢∫r
words in dictione and those in the mat

ter extra dictionem has not been by
any writers hitherto grounded on any distinct
principle at least not on any that they have
themselves adhered to the confounding to
gether however of these two classes is highly
detrimental to all clear notions concerning

logic being obviously allied to the prevailing
erroneous views which make logic the art of



elements of logic

employing the intellectual faculties in general
having the discovery of truth for its object and
all kinds of knowledge for its proper subject
matter with all that train of vague and ground
less speculations which have led to such inter
minable confusion and mistakes and afforded

a pretext for such clamorous censures
it is important therefore that rules should

be given for a division of fallacies into logi
cal and nonlogical on such a principle as
shall keep clear of all this indistinctness and
perplexity
if any one should object that the division
about to be adopted is in some degree arbi
trary placing under the one head fallacies
which many might be disposed to place under
the other let him consider not only the indis
tinctness of all former divisions but the utter

impossibility of framing any that shall be com
pletely secure from the objection urged in a
case where men have formed such various and

vague notions from the very want of some
clear principle of division nay from the
elliptical form in which all reasoning is usually
expressed and the peculiarly involved and
oblique form in which fallacy is for the most
part conveyed it must of course be often a
matter of doubt or rather of arbitrary choice

not only to which genus each kind of fallacy
should be referred but even to which kind to



of fallacies



refer any one individual fallacy for since in
any course of argument one

premiss is usually

suppressed it frequently happens in the case
of a fallacy that the hearers are left to the al
ternative of supplying either a premiss which
is not true or else one which does not prove the

conclusion e g if a man expatiates on the
distress of the country and thence argues that
the government is tyrannical we must suppose
him to assume either that √¢Äúevery distressed
country is under a tyranny√¢Äù which is a mani
fest falsehood or merely that √¢Äúevery country

under a tyranny is distressed√¢Äù which however
true proves nothing the middle term being
undistributed

now in the former case the

fallacy would be referred to the head of
√¢Äúextra dictionem √¢Äù in the latter to that of

√¢Äúin dictione√¢Äù which are we to suppose the
speaker meant us to understand surely just
whichever each of his hearers might happen to
prefer some might assent to the false premiss
others allow the unsound syllogism to the

sophist himself it is indifferent as long as they
can but be brought to admit the conclusion
without pretending then to conform to

every ones mode of speaking on the subject
or to lay down rules which shall be in them
selves without any call for labour or skill in
the person who employs them readily applica

ble to and decisive on each individual case i



elements of logic

propose a division which is at least perfectly
clear in its main principle and coincides per
haps as nearly as possible with the established

notions of logicians on the subject
√¢ß 

√•øocial r√¢∫l



in every fallacy the conclusion either does

or does not follow from the premises where
the conclusion does not follow from the pre

mises it is manifest that the fault is in the rea

soning and in that alone these therefore we
call logical fallacies√¢Äù as being properly vio
lations of those rules of reasoning which it is
the province of logic to lay down

of these however one kind are more purely
logical as exhibiting their fallaciousness by
the bare form of the expression without any

regard to the meaning of the terms to which
class belong st undistributed middle d
illicit process d negative premises or affir
mative conclusion from a negative premiss
and vice versa to which may be added th

those which have palpably i e expressed
more than three terms

the other kind may be most properly called
semilogical viz all the cases of ambiguous
middle term except its nondistribution for
though in such cases the conclusion does not
 in the same manner as we call that a criminal court

in which crimes are judged

of fallacies



follow and though the rules of logic show
that it does not as soon as the ambiguily of

the middle term is ascertained yet the discovery
and ascertainment of this ambiguity requires
attention to the sense of the term and know
ledge of the subject matter so that here

logic √¢Äúteaches us not how to find the fallacy
but only where to search for it√¢Äù and on what
principles to condemn it
accordingly it has been made a subject of
bitter complaint against logic that it presup
poses the most difficult point to be already ac
complished viz the sense of the terms to be
ascertained

a similar objection might be

urged against every other art in existence
eg against agriculture that all the precepts
for the cultivation of land presuppose the
possession of a farm or against perspective
that its rules are useless to a blind man

the

objection is indeed peculiarly absurd when
urged against logic because the object which
it is blamed for not accomplishing cannot pos
sibly be within the province of any one art
whatever

is it indeed possible or conceivable

that there should be any method science or
system that should enable one to know the
full and exact meaning of every term in exist

ence the utmost that can be done is to give
some general rules that may assist us in this



elements of logic

work which is done in the first two parts of
logic



the very author of the objection says √¢Äúthis
the comprehension of the meaning of general
terms is a study which every individual must
carry on for himself and of which no rules of
logic how useful soever they may be in di
recting our labours can supersede the neces
sity√¢Äù d stewart phil vol ii ch ii s 
nothing perhaps tends more to conceal from
men their imperfect conception of the meaning
of a term than the circumstance of their being
able fully to comprehend a process of reasoning
in which it is involved without attaching any
distinct meaning at all to that term as is evi
dent when xyz are used to stand for terms

in a regular syllogism thus a man may be

familiarized with a term and never find himself
at a loss from not comprehending it from
which he will be very likely to infer that he
does comprehend it when perhaps he does not
but employs it vaguely and incorrectly which

leads to fallacious reasoning and confusion
it must be owned however that many logical
writers have in great measure brought on

themselves the reproach in question by calling
logic √¢Äúthe right use of reason√¢Äù laying down
√¢Äúrules for gaining clear ideas√¢Äù and suchlike

xysia as aristotle calls it rhet book i
ch ii

of fallacies



√¢ß 

the remaining class viz where the conm√¢∫ura
clusion does follow from the premises may be

called the material or nonlogical fallacies
of these there are two kinds st when the

premises are such as ought not to have been
assumed d when the conclusion is not the

one required but irrelevant which fallacy is
called √¢Äúignoratio elemchi√¢Äù because your argu
ment is not the √¢Äúelenchus√¢Äù i e proof of the

contradictory of your opponents assertion
which it should be but proves instead of
that some other proposition resembling it
hence since logic defines what contradiction
is some may choose rather to range this with
the logical fallacies as it seems so far to
come under the jurisdiction of that art never
theless it is perhaps better to adhere to the

original division both on account of its clear
ness and also because few would be inclined to
apply to the fallacy in question the accusation

of being inconclusive and consequently illogical
reasoning besides which it seems an artificial
and circuitous way of speaking to suppose in
all cases an opponent and a contradiction the
simple statement of the matter being this i
 for it is manifest that the fault if there be any must

be either st in the premises or dly in the conclusion
or dly in the connection between them



elements of logic

am required by the circumstances of the case
no matter why to prove a certain conclusion
i prove not that but one which is likely to
be mistaken for it√¢Äîin this lies the fallacy
it might be desirable therefore to lay aside

the name of √¢Äúignoratio elemchi√¢Äù but that it is so
generally adopted as absolutely to require some
mention to be made of it

the other kind of

fallacies in the matter will comprehend as far
as the vague and obscure language of logical
writers will allow us to conjecture the fallacy

of √¢Äúnon causa pro causa√¢Äù and that of √¢Äúpetitio
principii of these the former is by them dis
tinguished into √¢Äúa non cera pro cera√¢Äù and √¢Äúa
non tali pro tali√¢Äù this last would appear to be
arguing from a case not parallel as if it were so 

which in logical language is having the sup
pressed premiss false for it is in that the pa
rallelism is affirmed and the √¢Äúnon vera pro
vera√¢Äù will in like manner signify the expressed
premiss being false so that this fallacy will
turn out to be in plain terms neither more

nor less than falsity or unfair assumption of
a premiss

the remaining kind √¢Äúpetitio principii√¢Äù
begging the question takes place when a pre
miss whether true or false is either plainly
equivalent to the conclusion or depends on it
for its own reception it is to be observed

however that in all correct reasoning the pre

of fallacies



mises must virtually imply the conclusion so
that it is not possible to mark precisely the dis

tinction between the fallacy in question and
fair argument since that may be correct and
fair reasoning to one person which would be
to another √¢Äúbegging the question√¢Äù sinceto one
the conclusion might be more evident than the
premiss and to the other the reverse the

most plausible form of this fallacy is arguing
in a circle and the greater the circle the
harder to detect

√¢ß 

there is no fallacy that may not properly
be included under some of the foregoing heads
those which in the logical treatises are sepa
rately enumerated and contradistinguished

√¢ß 
on each of the fallacies which have been

thus enumerated and distinguished i propose
to offer some more particular remarks but

before i proceed to this it will be proper to
premise two general observations st on the

importance and d the difficulty of detecting
and describing fallacies both have been al

ready slightly alluded to but it is requisite

that they should here be somewhat more fully
and distinctly set forth
st it seems by most persons to be taken

for granted that a fallacy is to be dreaded important
merely as a weapon fashioned and wielded by √¢Äù
a skilful sophist or if they allow that a man
may with honest intentions slide into one
unconsciously in the heat of argument still
they seem to suppose that where there is no

dispute there is no cause to dread fallacy
whereas there is much danger even in what

may be called solitary reasoning of sliding un
awares into some fallacy by which one may
be so far deceived as even to act upon the
conclusion thus obtained by solitary rea
soning i mean the case in which one is not
seeking for arguments to prove a given question
but labouring to elicit from ones previous

stock of knowledge some useful inference to

select one from innumerable examples that
might be cited and of which some more will
occur in the subsequent part of this essay it is
not improbable that many indifferent sermons

have been produced by the ambiguity of the
word √¢Äúplain a young divine perceives the
truth of the maxim that √¢Äúfor the lower orders

ones language cannot be too plain ie clear
and perspicuous so as to require no learning
nor ingenuity to understand it and when he
proceeds to practice the word √¢Äúplain√¢Äù indis
tinctly flits before him as it were and often
checks him in the use of ornaments of style
such as metaphor epithet antithesis c
which are opposed to √¢Äúplainness√¢Äù in a totally

different sense of the word being by no means
necessarily adverse to perspicuity but rather
in many cases conducive to it as may be seen
in several of the clearest of our lords dis

courses which are the very ones that are the
most richly adorned with figurative language
so far indeed is an ornamented style from
being unfit for the vulgar that they are pleased
with it even in excess

yet the desire to be

√¢Äú plain√¢Äù combined with that dim and confused

notion which the ambiguity of the word pro
duces in such as do not separate in their minds
and set before themselves the two meanings

often causes them to write in a dry and bald
style which has no advantage in point of per

of fallacies



spicuity and is least of all suited to the taste of
the vulgar the above instance is not drawn

from mere conjecture but from actual experi
ence of the fact

another instance of the strong influence of √¢∫t
words on our ideas may be adduced from a 

widely different subject most persons feel a
certain degree of surprise on first hearing of the
result of some late experiments of the agricul
tural chemists by which they have ascertained
that universally what are called heavy soils are

specifically the lightest and vice vers√£° whence
this surprise for no one ever distinctly believed
the established names to be used in the literal

and primary sense in consequence of the re

spective soils having been weighed together
indeed it is obvious on a moments reflection

that tenacious claysoils as well as muddy roads
are figuratively called heavy from the difficulty

of ploughing or passing over them which
produces an effect like that of bearing or drag
ging a heavy weight yet still the terms
√¢Äúlight√¢Äù and √¢Äúheavy√¢Äù though used figuratively
have most undoubtedly introduced into mens
minds something of the ideas expressed by

them in their primitive sense the same words
when applied to articles of diet have produced

important errors many supposing some arti
cle of food to be light of digestion from its
being specifically light so true is the inge

 √¢Äúmen imagine√¢Äù says bacon √¢Äúthat their minds have
the command of language but it oftenhappens that lan
guage bears rule over their mind√¢Äù some of the weak and
absurd arguments which are often urged against suicide
may be traced to the influence of words on thoughts
when a christian moralist is called on for a direct scrip

tural precept against suicide instead of replying that the
bible is not meant for a complete code of laws but for a

system of motives and principles the answer frequently
given is √¢Äúthou shalt do no murder√¢Äù and it is assumed
in the arguments drawn from reason as well as in those

from revelation that suicide is a species of murder viz
because it is called selfmurder and thus deluded by a
name many are led to rest on an unsound argument
which like all other fallacies does more harm than good
in the end to the cause of truth suicide if any one con
siders the nature and not the name of it evidently wants
the most essential characteristic of murder viz the hurt
and injury done to ones neighbour in depriving him of
life as well as to others by the insecurity they are in con
sequence liable to feel and since no one can strictly
speaking do injustice to himself he cannot in the literal
and primary acceptation of the words be said either to rob

or to murder himself he who deserts the post to which
he is appointed by his great master and presumptuously
cuts short the state of probation graciously allowed him for
working out his salvation whether by action or by patient
endurance is guilty indeed of a grievous sin but of one
not the least analogous in its character to murder it im

plies no inhumanity it is much more closely allied to
the sin of wasting life in indolence or in trifling pursuits
√¢Äîthat life which is bestowed as a seedtime for the harvest

of immortality what is called in familiar phrase √¢Äúkilling
time√¢Äù is in truth an approach as far as it goes to the
destruction of ones own life for √¢Äútime is the stuff life is
made of√¢Äù

more especially deserving of attention is the

influence of analogical terms in leading men
into erroneous notions in theology where the
most important terms are analogical and yet
they are continually employed in reasoning
without due attention oftener through want
of caution than by unfair design to their
analogical nature and most of the errors into
which theologians have fallen may be traced
in part to this cause
thus much as to the extensive practical
influence of fallacies and the consequent

high importance of detecting and exposing
them

√¢ß 
dly the second remark is that while detecting
pim√¢∫ny of
sound reasoning is ever the more readily adfall
mitted the more clearly it is perceived to be
such fallacy on the contrary being rejected

as soon as perceived will of course be the
it is surely wiser and safer to confine ourselves to such
arguments as will bear the test of a close examination than
to resort to such as may indeed at the first glance be more

specious and appear stronger but which when exposed
will too often leave a man a dupe to the fallacies on the
opposite side but it is especially the error of controver

sialists to urge every thing that can be urged to snatch
up the first weapon that comes to hand √¢Äúfuror arma
ministrat√¢Äù without waiting to consider what is true

more likely to obtain reception the more it is
obscured and disguised by obliquity and com

plexity of expression it is thus that it is the
most likely either to slip accidentally from the
careless reasoner or to be brought forward

deliberately by the sophist not that he ever
wishes that obscurity and complexity to be
perceived on the contrary it is for his pur

pose that the expression should appear as clear
and simple as possible while in reality it is the
most tangled net he can contrive thus

whereas it is usual to express our reasoning
elliptically so that a premiss or even two or

three entire steps in a course of argument
which may be readily supplied as being per
fectly obvious shall be left to be understood
the sophist in like manner suppresses what is

not obvious but is in reality the weakest part
of the argument and uses every other contri
vance to withdraw our attention his art closely
resembling the jugglers from the quarter
where the fallacy lies hence the uncertainty
before mentioned to which class any indivi
dual fallacy is to be referred and hence it is

that the difficulty of detecting and exposing
fallacy is so much greater than that of com
prehending and developing a process of sound
argument it is like the detection and appre
hension of a criminal in spite of all his arts of
concealment and disguise when this is accom

plished and he is brought to trial with all the
evidence of his guilt produced his conviction
and punishment are easy and this is precisely
the case with those fallacies which are given
as examples in logical treatises they are in

fact already detected by being stated in a plain
and regular form and are as it were only
brought up to receive sentence or again fal
lacious reasoning may be compared to a per
plexed and entangled mass of accounts which

it requires much sagacity and close attention
to clear up and display in a regular and intel
ligible form though when this is once accom

plished the whole appears so perfectly simple
that the unthinking are apt to undervalue

the skill and pains which have been employed
upon it



moreover it should be remembered that a

very long discussion is one of the most effec
tual veils of fallacy sophistry like poison is
at once detected and nauseated when presented

to us in a concentrated form but a fallacy
which when stated barely in a few sentences
would not deceive a child may deceive half the

world if diluted in a quarto volume for as
in a calculation one single figure incorrectly
stated will enable us to arrive at any result
whatever though every other figure and the
whole of the operations be correct so a single

false assumption in any process of reasoning



elements of logic

though every other be true will enable us to
draw what conclusion we please and the

greater the number of true assumptions the
more likely it is that the false one will pass
unnoticed but when you single out one

step in the course of the reasoning and exhi
bit it as a syllogism with one premiss true and
the other false the sophistry is easily per
ceived to speak therefore of all the falla
cies that have ever been enumerated as too

glaring and obvious to need even being men
tioned because the simple instances given in
logical treatises and there stated in the plainest

and consequently most easily detected form
are such as would in that form deceive no

ness or else unfairness it may readily be al
lowed indeed that to detect individual falla

cies and bring them under the general rules is
a harder task than to lay down those general
rules but this does not prove that the latter

office is trifling or useless or that it does not
essentially conduce to the performance of the

other there may be more ingenuity shown in
detecting and arresting a malefactor and con
victing him of the fact than in laying down a

law for the trial and punishment of such per
sons but the latter office i e that of a legis
lator is surely neither unnecessary nor trifling
it should be added that a close observation

and logical analysis of fallacious arguments
as it tends according to what has been already
said to form a habit of mind well suited for

the practical detection of fallacies so for
that very reason it will make us the more

careful in making allowance for them i e to
bear in mind how much men in general are

liable to be influenced by them eg a refuted
argument ought to go for nothing but in fact
it will generally prove detrimental to the cause
from the fallacy which will be presently ex
plained now no one is more likely to be prac
tically aware of this and to take precautions

accordingly than he who is most versed in the

√¢ß 

enough has already been said in the pre
ceding compendium 

and it has been re

marked above that it is often left to our

choice to refer an individual fallacy to this
head or to another

to the present class we may the most con
veniently refer those fallacies so common in
practice of supposing the conclusion false be
cause the premiss is false or because the ar

gument is unsound and inferring the truth of

the premiss from that of the conclusion eg
if any one argues for the existence of a god
from its being universally believed a man
might perhaps be able to refute the argument
by producing an instance of some nation des
titute of such belief the argument ought then

as has been observed above to go for nothing
but many would go further and think that
this refutation had disproved the existence of a

god in which they would be guilty of an illi
cit process of the major term viz √¢Äúwhatever
is universally believed must be true the exist
ence of a god is not universally believed

of fallacies



therefore it is not true√¢Äù others again from

being convinced of the truth of the conclusion
would infer that of the premises which would

amount to the fallacy of an undistributed mid
dle viz √¢Äúwhat is universally believed is
true the existence of a god is true therefore

it is universally believed√¢Äù

or these fallacies

might be stated in the hypothetical form 
since the one evidently proceeds from the de
nial of the antecedent to the denial of the con

sequent and the other from the establishing
of the consequent to the inferring of the ante
cedent which two fallacies will often be

found to correspond respectively with those of
illicit process of the major and undistributed
middle

fallacies of this class are very much kept

out of sight being seldom perceived even by
those who employ them but of their practi
cal importance there can be no doubt since it

is notorious that a weak argument is always
in practice detrimental and that there is no
absurdity so gross which men will not readily
admit if it appears to lead to a conclusion of
what they are already convinced even a

candid and sensible writer is not unlikely to
be by this means misled when he is seeking
for arguments to support a conclusion which
he has long been fully convinced of himself



elements of logic

i e he will often use such arguments as would
never have convinced himself and are not likely
to convince others but rather by the opera
tion of the converse fallacy to confirm in
their dissent those who before disagreed with
him

it is best therefore to endeavour to put

yourself in the place of an opponent to your
own arguments and consider whether you
could not find some objection to them the
applause of ones own party is a very unsafe

ground for judging of the real force of an ar
gumentative work and consequently of its
real utility to satisfy those who were doubt
ing and to convince those who were opposed
are the only sure tests but these persons are

seldom very loud in their applause or very for
ward in bearing their testimony
of ambiguous middle
√¢ß 
that case in which the middle is undistri

buted belongs of course to the preceding head
the fault being perfectly manifest from the

mere form of the expression in that case the
extremes are compared with two parts of the

same term but in the fallacy which has been
called semilogical which we are now to

of fallacies



speak of the extremes are compared with two
different terms the middle being used in two
different senses in the two premises

and here it may be remarked that when
the argument is brought into the form of a
regular syllogism the contrast between these

two senses will usually appear very striking
from the two premises being placed together
and hence the scorn with which many have
treated the very mention of the fallacy of

equivocation deriving their only notion of it
from the exposure of it in logical treatises
whereas in practice it is common for the two
premises to be placed very far apart and dis

cussed in different parts of the discourse by
which means the inattentive hearer overlooks

any ambiguity that may exist in the middle
term hence the advantage of logical habits
to fix our attention strongly and steadily on
the important terms of an argument
one case which may be regarded as coming
under the head of ambiguous middle is what
is called √¢Äúfallacia figura dictionis√¢Äù the fal
lacy built on the grammatical structure of lan
guage from mens usually taking for granted that
paronymous words ie those belonging to each
other as the substantive adjective verb c
of the same root have a precisely corre
 for some instances of important ambiguities see ap
pendix



elements of logic

spondent meaning which is by no means uni
versally the case such a fallacy could not
indeed be even exhibited in strict logical
form which would preclude even the attempt
at it since it has two middle terms in sound as

well as sense but nothing is more common
in practice than to vary continually the terms

employed with a view to grammatical con
nience nor is there anything unfair in such a
practice as long as the meaning is preserved
unaltered eg √¢Äúmurder should be punished
with death this man is a murderer therefore

he deserves to die√¢Äù c c here we proceed
on the assumption in this case just that to
commit murder and to be a murderer to de

serve death and to be one who ought to die
are respectively equivalent expressions and
it would frequently prove a heavy inconve
nience to be debarred this kind of liberty but
the abuse of it gives rise to the fallacy in
question eg projectors are unfit to be
trusted this man has formed a project there
fore he is unfit to be trusted here the sophist

proceeds on the hypothesis that he who forms
a project must be a projector whereas the bad
sense that commonly attaches to the latter

word is not at all implied in the former
this fallacy may often be considered as
 adam smiths wealth of nations usury



of fallacies

lying not in the middle but in one of the terms
of the conclusion so that the conclusion

drawn shall not be in reality at all warranted

by the premises though it will appear to be
so by means of the grammatical affinity of the
words eg √¢Äúto be acquainted with the guilty
is a presumption of guilt this man is so ac
quainted therefore we may presume that he is
guilty this argument proceeds on the suppo
sition of an exact correspondence between
√¢Äú presume√¢Äù and √¢Äúpresumption√¢Äù which how
ever does not really exist for √¢Äúpresumption√¢Äù

it commonly used to express a kind of slight
suspicion whereas √¢Äúto presume√¢Äù amounts to
absolute belief
the above remark will apply to some other

cases of ambiguity of term viz the conclusion
will often contain a term which though not
as here different in expression from the cor

responding one in the premiss yet is liable to
be understood in a sense different from what it

bears to the premiss though of course such
a fallacy is less common because less likely to
deceive in those cases than in this where the

term used in the conclusion though professing
to correspond with one in the premiss is not
the very same in expression and therefore is

more certain to convey a different sense which
is what the sophist wishes



there are innumerable instances of a non



elements of logic

correspondence in paronymous words similar
to that above instanced as between art and

artful design and designing faith and faithful
c and the more slight the variation of

meaning the more likely is the fallacy to be
successful for when the words have become

so widely removed in sense as √¢Äúpity√¢Äù and

√¢Äúpitiful√¢Äù every one would perceive such a fal
lacy nor could it be employed but in jest
this fallacy cannot in practice be refuted

by stating merely the impossibility of reducing
such an argument to the strict logical form
unless indeed you are addressing regular lo

gicians you mustfind some way of pointing out
the noncorrespondence of the terms in ques
tion eg with respect to the example above
it might be remarked that we speak of strong
or faint √¢Äúpresumption√¢Äù but we use no such
expression in conjunction with the verb √¢Äúpre
sume√¢Äù because the word itself implies strength
no fallacy is more common in controversy
than the present since in this way the sophist
will often be able to misinterpret the proposi
tions which his opponent admits or maintains

and so employ them against him thus in the
examples just given it is natural to conceive

one of the sophists premises to have been
borrowed from his opponent
 perhaps a dictionary of such paronymous words as do
mot regularly correspond in meaning would be nearly as

of fallacies

i

the present fallacy is nearly allied to or
rather perhaps may be regarded as a branch
of that founded on etymology viz when
a term is used at one time in its customary
and at another in its etymological sense
perhaps no example of this can be found
that is more extensively and mischievously
employed than in the case of the word re

presentative assuming that its right mean
ing must correspond exactly with the strict
and original sense of the verb √¢Äúrepresent√¢Äù
the sophist persuades the multitude that a
member of the house of commons is bound to

be guided in all points by the opinion of his
constituents and in short to be merely their
spokesman whereas law and custom which in
this case may be considered as fixing the mean
ing of the term require no such thing but en
join the representative to act according to the
best of his own judgment and on his own re
sponsibility
useful as one of synonyms i e properly speaking of
pseudosynonyms

 h tooke has furnished a whole magazine of such
weapons for any sophist who may need them and fur
nished some specimens of the employment of them
he contends that it is idle to speak of eternal or im
mutable √¢Äútruth√¢Äù because the word is derived from to

√¢Äútrow√¢Äù ie believe he might on as good grounds
have censured the absurdity of speaking of sending a let
ter by the √¢Äúpost√¢Äù because a post in its primary sense is
a pillar or have insisted that √¢Äúsycophant√¢Äù can never
mean anything but √¢Äúfigshewer√¢Äù

called √¢Äúfallacia plurium interrogationum√¢Äù
which may be named simply √¢Äúthe fallacy of
interrogation√¢Äù viz the fallacy of asking se
veral questions which appear to be but one so

that whatever one answer is given being of
course applicable to one only of the implied
questions may be interpreted as applied to the

other the refutation is of course to reply se
parately to each question i e to detect the
ambiguity
i have said several √¢Äúquestions which appear

to be but one for else there is no fallacy such
an example therefore as √¢Äúestne homo animal et

lapis which aldrich gives is foreign to the
matter in hand for there is nothing unfair in

asking two distinct questions any more than
in asserting two distinct propositions dis
tinctly and avowedly

this fallacy may be referred as has been
said to the head of ambiguous middle in all
reasoning it is very common to state one of
the premises in form of a question and when
that is admitted or supposed to be admitted
then to fill up the rest if then one of the
terms of that question be ambiguous which
ever sense the opponent replies to the sophist

of fallacies



assumes the other sense of the term in the re

maining premiss it is therefore very com
mon to state an equivocal argument in form

of a question so worded that there shall be
little doubt which reply will be given but if
there be such doubt the sophist must have
two fallacies of equivocation ready eg the
question √¢Äúwhether anything vicious is expe
dient√¢Äù discussed in cic off book iii where

by the by he seems not a little perplexed with
it himself is of the character in question from

the ambiguity of the word √¢Äúexpedient√¢Äù which
means sometimes √¢Äú conducive to temporal
prosperity√¢Äù sometimes √¢Äú conducive to the
greatest good√¢Äù whichever answer therefore
was given the sophist might have a fallacy
of equivocation founded on this term viz if

the answer be in the negative his argument
logically developed will stand thus √¢Äúwhat
is vicious is not expedient whatever conduces
to the acquisition of wealth and aggrandize
ment is expedient therefore it cannot be
vicious√¢Äù if in the affirmative then thus

whatever is expedient is desirable something
vicious is expedient therefore desirable√¢Äù

this kind of fallacy is frequently employed
in such a manner that the uncertainty shall

be not about the meaning but the extent of a
term i e whether it is distributed or not e g
√¢Äúdid a b in this case act from such and such
m 



elements of logic

a motive which may imply either √¢Äúwas it
his sole motive or √¢Äúwas it one of his mo
tives in the former case the term √¢Äú that

which√¢Äîactuateda b is distributed in the lat

ter not now if he acted from a mixture of
motives whichever answer you give may be

misrepresented and thus disproved
√¢ß 
in some cases of ambiguous middle the term

in question may be considered as having in it
self from its own equivocal nature two signi
fications which apparently constitutes the
√¢Äúfallacia equivocationis√¢Äù of logical writers
others again have a middle term which is am
biguous from the context i e from what is
wnderstood in conjunction with it this divi
sion will be found useful though it is impos
sible to draw the line accurately in it the
elliptical character of ordinary discourse causes
many terms to become practically ambiguous
which yet are not themselves employed in dif
ferentsenses but with differentapplications which
are understood

thus √¢Äú the faith√¢Äù would be

used by a christian writer to denote the christian
faith and by a mussulman the mahometan 

yet the word faith has not in these cases of
itself two different significations so √¢∫xexrot
√¢Äú elect√¢Äù or √¢Äúchosen√¢Äù is sometimes applied to
such as are √¢Äúchosen√¢Äù to certain privileges and

of fallacies



advantages as the israelites were though
√¢Äúthey were overthrown in the wilderness for
their disobedience and as all christians are

frequently called in the new testament some
times again to those who are √¢Äúchosen√¢Äù as fit
to receive a final reward having made a right

use of those advantages as when our lord
says √¢Äúmany are called but few chosen√¢Äù
there are various ways in which words
come to have two meanings st by accident
i e when there is no perceptible connection

between the two meanings as √¢Äúlight√¢Äù signi
 what logicians have mentioned under the title of
√¢Äúfallacia amphibolicae√¢Äù is referable to this last class
though in real practice it is not very likely to occur an
amphibolous sentence is one that is capable of two mean
ings not from the double sense of any of the words but
from its admitting of a double construction as in the in
stance aldrich gives which is untranslatable √¢Äúquod tan
gitur a socrate illud sentit√¢Äù where √¢Äúillud√¢Äù may be
taken either as the nominative or accusative

so also the

celebrated response of the oracle √¢Äúaio te aeacida ro
manos vincere posse√¢Äù which closely resembles as shak
spere remarks the witchprophecy √¢Äúthe duke yet lives
that henry shall depose√¢Äù a similar effect is produced by
what the french call √¢Äúconstruction louche√¢Äù a squinting

construction i e where some word or words may be re

of which an instance occurs in the rubric prefixed to the

fies both the contrary to √¢Äúheavy√¢Äù and the

contrary to √¢Äúdark√¢Äù thus such proper names
as john or thomas c which happen to be

long to several different persons are ambiguous
because they have a different signification in
each case where they are applied words which
fall under this first head are what are the most

strictly called equivocal
dly there are several terms in the use of
which it is necessary to notice the distinction
between first and second intention the √¢Äúfirst

intention√¢Äù of a term according to the usual
acceptation of this phrase is a certain vague
and general signification of it as opposed to√¢∫
one more precise and limited which it bears in
some particular art science or system and
 i am aware that there exists another opinion as to
the meaning of the phrase √¢Äúsecondintention√¢Äù and that
aldrich is understood by some persons to mean as indeed

his expression may very well be understood to imply that
every predicable must necessarily be employed in the se

i do not undertake to combat the doc

trine alluded to because i must confess that after the

most patient attention devoted to the explanations given
of it i have never been able to comprehend what it is that
is meant by it it is one however which whether sound

or unsound appears not to be connected with any logical
processes and therefore may be safely passed by on the

neral acceptation which every one is well ac

quainted with of each of those two words is
the firstintention of each the other its
secondintention



it is evident that a term may have several

secondintentions according to the several sys
tems into which it is introduced and of which
it is one of the technical terms thus √¢Äú line√¢Äù

signifies in the artmilitary a certain form
of drawing up ships or troops in geography
a certain division of the earth to the fisher

man a string to catch fish c c all which
are so many distinct secondintentions in each

of which there is a certain signification √¢Äúof
extension in length which constitutes the first
intention and which corresponds pretty nearly
with the employment of the term in mathe
matics√¢Äù

it will sometimes happen that a term shall

be employed always in some one or other of
 in a few instances the secondintention or philoso
phical employment of a term is more ertensive than the
firstintention or popular use thus √¢Äúaffection√¢Äù is limited
in popular use to √¢Äúlove√¢Äù and √¢Äúflower√¢Äù to those which
have conspicuous petals



elements of logic

its second intentions and never strictly in
the first though that first intention is a part of
its signification in each case it is evident
that the utmost care is requisite to avoid con
founding together either the first and second
intentions or the different second intentions
with each other
resemblance

dly when two or more things are con

and analogy

nected by resemblance or analogy they will
frequently have the same name thus a
√¢Äúblade of grass√¢Äù and the contrivance in build
ing called a √¢Äú dovetail√¢Äù are so called from
their resemblance to the blade√¢Äù of a sword and
the tail of a real dove but two things may be
connected by analogy though they have in
themselves no resemblance for analogy is the
resemblance of ratios or relations thus as
a sweet taste gratifies the palate so does a sweet
sound gratify the ear and hence the same
word √¢Äúsweet√¢Äù is applied to both though no
flavour can resemble a sound in itself so the
leg of a table does not resemble that of an ani
mal nor the foot of a mountain that of an

animal but the leg answers the same purpose
to the table as the leg of an animal to that
animal the foot of a mountain has the same

unless indeed the primary application of the term be
to the leaf of grass and the secondary to cutting instru
ments which is perhaps more probable but the question
is unimportant in the present case



of fallacies



situation relatively to the mountain as the foot
of an animal to the animal this analogy
therefore may be expressed like a mathemati

cal analogy or proportion √¢Äúleg animal 
supporting stick table√¢Äù
in all these cases of this d head one of
the meanings of the word is called by logi
cians proper i e original or primary the

other improper secondary or transferred
thus sweet is originally and properly applied

to tastes secondarily and improperly ie by
analogy to sounds thus also dovetail is ap
plied secondarily though not by analogy but
by direct resemblance to the contrivance in
building so called when the secondary
meaning of a word is founded on some fanci
ful analogy and especially when it is intro
duced for ornament sake we call this a meta

phor as when we speak of √¢Äúa ships plough
ing the deep√¢Äù the turning up of the surface
being essential indeed to the plough but acci

dental only to the ship but if the analogy be
a more important and essential one and espe
cially if we have no other word to express our

meaning but this transferred one we then call
it merely an analogous word though the meta
phor is analogous also e g one would
hardly call it metaphorical or figurative lan
guage to speak of the leg of a table or mouth
of a river

elements of logic

thly several things may be called by the
same name though they have no connection
of resemblance or analogy from being con√¢Äì

nected by vicinity of time or place under which
head will come the connection of cause and

effect or of part and whole c thus a door
signifies both an opening in the wall more
strictly called the doorway and a board which
closes it which are things neither similar nor

analogous when i say √¢Äú the rose smells
sweet√¢Äù and √¢Äúi smell the rose√¢Äù the word
√¢Äúsmell√¢Äù has two meanings in the latter sen

tence i am speaking of a certain sensation in
my own mind in the former of a certain qua
lity in the flower which produces that sensa
tion but which of course cannot in the least
resemble it and here the word smell is applied

with equal propriety to both thus we speak
of homer for √¢Äúthe works of homer√¢Äù and
this is a secondary or transferred meaning
and so it is when we say √¢Äúa good shot√¢Äù for a
good marksman but the word √¢Äúshot√¢Äù has two
other meanings which are both equally pro
per viz the thing put into a gun in order to

be discharged from it and the act of discharg
ing it

thus √¢Äúlearning signifies either the act of
acquiring knowledge or the knowledge itself
eg √¢Äúhe neglects his learning√¢Äù √¢Äújohnson
was a man of learning√¢Äù √¢Äúpossession√¢Äù is ambi

guous in the same manner and a multitude of
others



much confusion often arises from ambiguity
of this kind when unperceived nor is there
any point in which the copiousness and conse

quent precision of the greek language is more
to be admired than in its distinct terms for ex

pressing an act and the result of that act eg

apa√•°is √¢Äúthe doingofanythingapayua the thing
done √¢Äù so ms and wpov anvis and anupa c

it will very often happen that two of the
meanings of a word will have no connection
with one another but will each have some con

nection with a third thus √¢Äúmartyr originally
signified a witness thence it was applied to those
who suffered in bearing testimony to christia

nity and thence again it is often applied to
√¢Äúsufferers in general the first and third signi
fications are not the least connected

thus

√¢Äúpost√¢Äù signifies originally a pillar postum
from pono then a distance marked out by
posts and then the carriages messengers c
that travelled over this distane

innumera

ble other ambiguities might be brought under
this fourth head which indeed comprehends
all the cases which do not fall under the three
others

the remedy for ambiguity is a definition of

the term which is suspected of being used in
two senses viz a nominal not necessarily a



elements of logic

real definition as was remarked in the com

pendium

but here it may be proper to remark that
for the avoiding of fallacy or of verbal con√¢Äì
troversy it is only requisite that the term
should be employed uniformly in the same
sense as far as the existing question is concerned
thus two persons might in discussing the
question whether caesar was a great man
have some difference in their acceptation of the

epithet √¢Äúgreat√¢Äù which would be nonessential
to that question eg one of them might un
derstand by it nothing more than eminent in
tellectual and moral qualities while the other
might conceive it to imply the performance of
splendid actions this abstract difference of
meaning would not produce any disagreement

in the existing question because both those
circumstances are united in the case of caesar

but if one and not the other of the parties
understood the epithet √¢Äúgreat√¢Äù to imply pure
patriotism generosity of character c then
there would be a disagreement as to the appli
cation of the term even between those who

might think alike of caesars character de
finition the specific for ambiguity is to be
employed and demanded with a view to this
principle it is sufficient on each occasion to

define a term as far as regards the question in
hand



of fallacies



√¢ß 

of those cases where the ambiguity arises
jrom the context there are several species some
of which logicians have enumerated but have
neglected to refer them in the first place to
one common class viz the one under which

they are here placed and have even arranged
some under the head of fallacies √¢Äúin dictione√¢Äù
and others under that of √¢Äúextra dictionem√¢Äù

we may consider as the first of these spefill
cies the fallacy of √¢Äúdivision√¢Äù and that of 
√¢Äúcomposition√¢Äù taken together since in each
of these the middle term is used in one pre

miss collectively in the other distributively if
the former of these is the major premiss and
the latter the minor this is called the √¢Äúfal

lacy of division√¢Äù the term which is first
taken collectively being afterwards divided

and vice vers√£° the ordinary examples are
such as these √¢Äúall the angles of a triangle
are equal to two right angles a b c is an
angle of a triangle therefore a b c is equal
to two right angles√¢Äù √¢Äúfive is one number
three and two are five therefore three and two
are one number or √¢Äúthree and two are two

numbers five is three and two therefore five is
two numbers it is manifest that the middle

term three and two in this last example is

ambiguous signifying in the major premiss



elements of logic

√¢Äútaken distinctly√¢Äù in the minor √¢Äútaken toge
ther√¢Äù and so of the rest

to this head may be referred the fallacy by
which men have sometimes been led to admit

or pretend to admit the doctrine of necessity 
eg √¢Äúhe who necessarily goes or stays i e
in reality √¢Äúwho necessarily goes or who neces

sarily stays is not a free agent you must ne
cessarily go or stay i e √¢Äúyou must necessa
rily take the alternative therefore you are not

a free agent√¢Äù such also is the fallacy which
probably operates on most adventurers in lot
teries eg √¢Äúthe gaining of a high prize is
no uncommon occurrence and what is no un

common occurrence may reasonably be ex
pected therefore the gaining of a high prize
may reasonably be expected √¢Äù the conclusion
when applied to the individual as in practice
it is must be understood in the sense of √¢Äúrea
sonably expected by a certain individual√¢Äù there
fore for the major premiss to be true the mid
dle term must be understood to mean √¢Äúno
uncommon occurrence to some one particular
person √¢Äù whereas for the minor which has

been placed first to be true you must under
stand it of √¢Äúno uncommon occurrence to

some one or other and thus you will have the
fallacy of composition
there is no fallacy more common or more
likely to deceive than the one now before us



of fallacies



the form in which it is most usually employed
is to establish some truth separately concern
ing each single member of a certain class and
thence to infer the same of the whole collec

tively thus some infidels have laboured to
prove concerning some one of our lords mi

racles that it might have been the result of
an accidental conjuncture of natural circum
stances next they endeavour to prove the
same concerning another and so on and

thence infer that all of them might have been
so they might argue in like manner that

because it is not very improbable one may
throw sixes in any one out of a hundred
throws therefore it is no more improbable that
one may throw sixes a hundred times run
ning
this fallacy may often be considered as
turning on the ambiguity of the word √¢Äúall√¢Äù
which may easily be dispelled by substituting
for it the word √¢Äúeach√¢Äù or √¢Äúevery√¢Äù where that
is its signification eg √¢Äúall these trees make
a thick shade√¢Äù is ambiguous meaning either
√¢Äúevery one of them√¢Äù or √¢Äúall together√¢Äù
this is a fallacy with which men are ex
tremely apt to deceive themselves for when a
multitude of particulars are presented to the
mind many are too weak or too indolent to
take a comprehensive view of them but con
fine their attention to each single point by



elements of logic

turns and then decide infer and act accord

ingly e g the imprudent spendthrift finding
that he is able to afford this or that or the

other expense forgets that all of them together
will ruin him



to the same head may be reduced that falla
cious reasoning by which men vindicate them
selves to their own conscience and to others

for the neglect of those undefined duties which
though indispensable and therefore not left to
our choice whether we will practise them or
not are left to our discretion as to the mode

and the particular occasions of practising them
eg √¢Äúi am not bound to contribute to this
charity in particular nor to that nor to the
other the practical conclusion which they
draw is that all charity may be dispensed
with

as men are apt to forget that any two cir
cumstances not naturally connected are more
rarely to be met with combined than separate
though they be not at all incompatible so also
they are apt to imagine from finding that they
are rarely combined that there is an incompa

tibility e g if the chances are ten to one
against a mans possessing strong reasoning
powers and ten to one against exquisite taste

the chances against the combination of the
two supposing them neither connected nor
opposed will be a hundred to one many

of fallacies



therefore from finding them so rarely united
will infer that they are in some measure in
compatible which fallacy may easily be ex
posed in the form of undistributed middle

√¢Äúqualities unfriendly to each other are rarely
combined excellence in the reasoning powers

and in taste are rarely combined therefore
they are qualities unfriendly to each other√¢Äù
√¢ß 
fallacia ao

the other kind of ambiguity arising from cidentis
the context and which is the last case of

ambiguous middle that we shall notice is the
√¢Äúfallacia accidentis√¢Äù together with its converse
√¢Äúfallacia a dicto secundum quid ad dictum sim
pliciter√¢Äù in each of which the middle term is
used in one premiss to signify something con
sidered simply in itself and as to its essence
and in the other premiss so as to imply that
its accidents are taken into account with it as

in the wellknown example √¢Äúwhat is bought
in the market is eaten raw meat is bought in
the market therefore raw meat is eaten√¢Äù

here the middle has understood in conjunction
with it in the major premiss √¢Äúas to its sub
stance merely in the minor √¢Äúas to its condi
tion and circumstances√¢Äù

to this head perhaps as well as to any may
be referred the fallacies which are frequently
founded on the occasional partial and tempo
n



elements of logic

rary variations in the acceptation of some
term arising from circumstances of person
time and place which will occasion something
to be understood in conjunction with it beyond
its strict literal signification eg the phrase

√¢Äúprotestant ascendancy√¢Äù having become a
kind of watchword or gatheringcry of a
party the expression of good wishes for it
would commonly imply an adherence to certain
measures not literally expressed by the words
to assume therefore that one is unfriendly to

√¢Äúprotestant ascendancy√¢Äù in the literal sense
because he has declared himself unfriendly to

it when implying and connected with such and
such other sentiments is a gross fallacy and
such an one as perhaps the authors of the above
would much object to if it were assumed of
them that they were adverse to √¢Äúthe cause of
liberty throughout the world√¢Äù and to √¢Äúa fair
representation of the people√¢Äù from their ob

jecting to join with the members of a factious
party in the expression of such sentiments
such fallacies may fairly be referred to the
present head
√¢ß 
begging the
question

of the nonlogical or material fallacies
and first of √¢Äúbegging the question petitio
principii

the indistinct and unphilosophical account

of fallacies



which has been given by logical writers of
the fallacy of √¢Äúnon causa√¢Äù and that of √¢Äúpeti

tio principii√¢Äù makes it very difficult to ascertain
wherein they conceived them to differ and
what according to them is the nature of each
without therefore professing to conform ex
actly to their meaning and with a view to dis
tinctness only which is the main point let us
confine the name √¢Äúpetitio principii√¢Äù to those
cases in which the premiss either appears ma

nifestly to be the same as the conclusion or
is actually proved from the conclusion or is
such as would naturally and properly so be
proved as if one should attempt to prove the
being of a god from the authority of holy
writ and to the other class be referred all

other cases in which the premiss whether the
expressed or the suppressed one is either
proved false or has no sufficient claim to be
received as true

let it however be observed

that in such cases apparently as this we must
not too hastily pronounce the argument falla
cious for it may be perfectly fair at the com
mencement of an argument to assume a premiss
that is not more evident than the conclusion

or is even ever se paradoxical provided you
proceed to prove fairly that premiss and in
like manner it is both usual and fair to begin
by deducing your conclusion from a premiss

exactly equivalent to it which is merely
n 



elements of logic

throwing the proposition in question into the
form in which it will be most conveniently
proved arguing in a circle however must

necessarily be unfair though it frequently is
practised undesignedly e g some mechani
cians attempt to prove what they ought to

lay down as a probable but doubtful hypothe
sis that every particle of matter gravitates

equally √¢Äúwhy because those bodies which
contain more particles ever gravitate more

strongly i e are heavier √¢Äúbut it may be
urged those which are heaviest are not always
more bulky√¢Äù √¢Äúno but still they contain more

particles though more closely condensed 
√¢Äúhow do you know that because they are
heavier√¢Äù √¢Äúhow does that prove it√¢Äù √¢Äúbecause
all particles of matter gravitating equally that
mass which is specifically the heavier must
needs have the more of them in the same

space√¢Äù

obliquity and disguise being of course most
important to the success of the petitio principii
as well as of other fallacies the sophist will in
general either have recourse to the circle or
else not venture to state distinctly his assump
tion of the point in question but will rather
assert some other proposition which implies it
thus keeping out of sight as a dexterous thief

does stolen goods the point in question at the
very moment when he is taking it for granted 

of fallacies



hence the frequent union of this fallacy with
√¢Äúignoratio elemchi√¢Äù vide √¢ß the english lan
guage is perhaps the more suitable for the fal
lacy of petitioprincipii from its being formed from
two distinct languages and thus abounding
in synonymous expressions which have no re

semblance in sound and no connection in ety
mology so that a sophist may bring forward a
proposition expressed in words of saxon ori
gin and give as a reason for it the very same

proposition stated in words of norman origin
eg √¢Äúto allow every man an unbounded free
dom of speech must always be on the whole

advantageous to the state for it is highly
conducive to the interest of the community

that each individual should enjoy a liberty
perfectly unlimited of expressing his senti
ments√¢Äù

√¢ß 
undue as

the next head is the falsity or at least sumption
undue assumption of a premiss when it is not

equivalent to or dependent on the conclusion
which as has been before said seems to corre

spond nearly with the meaning of logicians
when they speak of √¢Äúnon causa pro causa √¢Äù
this name indeed would seem to imply a much
narrower class there being one species of ar
guments which are from cause to effect in
which of course two things are necessary



elements of logic

st the sufficiency of the cause nd its esta
blishment these are the two premises if
therefore the former be unduly assumed we

are arguing from that which is not a sufficient
cause as if it were so eg as if one should
contend from such a mans having been unjust
or cruel that he will certainly be visited with
some heavy temporal judgment and come to
an untimely end in this instance the sophist
from having assumed in the premiss the

granted existence of a pretended cause infers
in the conclusion the existence of the pretended
effect which we have supposed to be the ques

tion or vice versa the pretended effect may be
employed to establish the cause eg inferring
sinfulness from temporal calamity but when
both the pretended cause and effect are granted
i e granted to exist then the sophist will in
fer something from their pretended connection
ie he will assume as a premiss that √¢Äúof these
two admitted facts the one is the cause of the

other as the opponents of the reformation
assumed that it was the cause of the troubles

which took place at that period and thence
inferred that it was an evil in like manner

nothing is more common than to hear a person
state confidently as from his own experience
that such and such a patient was cured by this
or that medicine whereas all that he abso

lutely knows is that he took the medicine and

of fallacies

is

that he recovered such an argument as ei
ther of these might strictly be called √¢Äúnon
causa pro causa √¢Äù but it is not probable that

the logical writers intended any such limita
tion which indeed would be wholly unneces
sary and impertinent but rather that they
were confounding together cause and reason
the sequence of conclusion from premises being

perpetually mistaken for that of effect from
physical cause√¢Äù it may be better therefore

to drop the name which tends to perpetuate
this confusion and simply to state when such

is the case that the premiss is unduly as
sumed i e without being either selfevident
or satisfactorily proved

the contrivances by which men may deceive
themselves or others in assuming premises
unduly so that that undue assumption shall not

be perceived for it is in this the fallacy con
sists are of course infinite sometimes as was
before observed the doubtful premiss is sup

pressed as if it were too evident to need being
proved or even stated and as if the whole
question turned on the establishment of the
other premiss

thus h tooke proves by an immense in
duction that all particles were originally nouns
or verbs and thence concludes that in reality
 see appendix no article reason



elements of logic

they are so still and that the ordinary division
of the parts of speech is absurd keeping out
of sight as selfevident the other premiss
which is absolutely false viz that the mean

ing and force of a word now and for ever
must be that which it or its root originally
bore

sometimes men are shamed into admitting
an unfounded assertion by being assured that
it is so evident it would argue great weakness
to doubt it in general however the more
skilful sophist will avoid a direct assertion of

what he means unduly to assume because that
might direct the readers attention to the con
sideration of the question whether it be true or
not since that which is indisputable does not
so often need to be asserted it succeeds bet

ter therefore if you allude to the proposition
as something curious and remarkable just as

the royal society were imposed on by being
asked to account for the fact that a vessel of

water received no addition to its weight by a
live fish put into it while they were seeking

for the cause they forgot to ascertain the fact
and thus admitted without suspicion a mere
fiction thus an eminent scotch writer in

stead of asserting that √¢Äúthe advocates of logic
have been worsted and driven from the field

in every controversy√¢Äù an assertion which if
made would have been the more readily ascer

tained to be perfectly groundless merely ob
serves that √¢Äúit is a circumstance not a little
remarkable√¢Äù



one of the many contrivances employed for
this purpose is what may be called the √¢Äúfal
lacy of references √¢Äù which is particularly com
mon in popular theological works it is of
course a circumstance which adds great weight
to any assertion that it shall seem to be sup
ported by many passages of scripture now
when a writer can find few or none of these that

distinctly and decidedly favour his opinion he
may at least find many which may be conceived
capable of being so understood or which in
some way or other remotely relate to the sub

ject but if these texts were inserted at length
it would be at once perceived how little they
bear on the question the usual artifice there
fore is to give merely references to them 
trusting that nineteen out of twenty readers
will never take the trouble of turning to the

passages but taking for granted that they af
ford each some degree of confirmation to what
is maintained will be overawed by seeing
every assertion supported as they suppose by
five or six scripturetexts

frequently the fallacy of ignoratio elemchi is
called in to the aid of this i e the premiss is

assumed on the ground of another proposition



elements of logic

somewhat like it having been proved thus in
arguing by example c the parallelism of two
cases is often assumed from their being in some

respects alike though perhaps they differ in the
very point which is essential to the argument 
eg from the circumstance that some men of
humble station who have been well educated

are apt to think themselves above low drudgery

it is argued that universal education of the
lower orders would beget general idleness

this argument rests of course on the assump
tion of parallelism in the two cases viz the
past and the future whereas there is a cir
cumstance that is absolutely essential in which
they differ for when education is universal it

must cease to be a distinction which is pro
bably the very circumstance that renders men
too proud for their work
this very same fallacy is often resorted to on
the opposite side an attempt is made to inva
lidate some argument from example by point
ing out a difference between the two cases

though they agree in everything that is essen
tial to the question

lastly it may be here remarked conform
ably with what has been formerly said that it
will often be left to your choice whether to re
fer this or that fallacious argument to the
present head or that of ambiguous middle

of fallacies



√¢Äúif the middle term is here used in this sense
there is an ambiguity if in that sense the pro
position is false√¢Äù
√¢ß 
irrelevant
the last kind of fallacy to be discussed is conclusion

that of irrelevant conclusion commonly
called ignoratio elemchi various kinds of pro
positions are according to the occasion sub
stituted for the one of which proof is required
sometimes the particular for the universal
sometimes a proposition with different terms
and various are the contrivances employed to
effect and to conceal this substitution and to

make the conclusion which the sophist has
drawn answer practically the same purpose
as the one he ought to have established we
say √¢Äúpractically the same purpose√¢Äù because
it will very often happen that some emotion will
be excited√¢Äîsome sentiment impressed on the
mind√¢Äîby a dexterous employment of this
fallacy such as shall bring men into the dis

position requisite for your purpose though
they may not have assented to or even stated
distinctly in their own minds the proposition
which it was your business to establish thus
if a sophist has to defend one who has been
guilty of some serious offence which he wishes

to extenuate though he is unable distinctly to
prove that it is not such yet if he can succeed

s

elements of logic

in making the audience laugh at some casual
matter he has gained practically the same
point so also if any one has pointed out the
extenuating circumstances in some particular
case of offence so as to show that it differs

widely from the generality of the same class
the sophist if he find himself unable to dis
prove these circumstances may do away the

force of them by simply referring the action to
that very class which no one can deny that it

belongs to and the very name of which will
excite a feeling of disgust sufficient to counter

act the extenuation eg let it be a case of
peculation and that many mitigating circum
stances have been brought forward which can
not be denied the sophistical opponent will
reply √¢Äúwell but after all the man is a rogue
and there is an end of it now in reality this
was by hypothesis never the question and
the mere assertion of what was never denied
ought not in fairness to be regarded as deci

sive but practically the odiousness of the
word arising in great measure from the asso

ciation of those very circumstances which belong
to most of the class but which we have sup
posed to be absent in this particular instance
excites precisely that feeling of disgust which
in effect destroys the force of the defence in
like manner we may refer to this head all cases
of improper appeals to the passions and every

of fallacies



thing else which is mentioned by aristotle as
extraneous to the matter in hand r
payaaros
in all these cases as has been before ob

served if the fallacy we are now treating of

be employed for the apparent establishment
not of the ultimate conclusion but as it very
commonly happens of a premiss i e if the
premiss required be assumed on the ground

that some proposition resembling it has been
proved then there will be a combination of
this fallacy with the last mentioned

a good instance of the employment and expo
sure of this fallacy occurs in thucydides in the

speeches of cleon and diodotus concerning the
mitylenaeans the former over and above his
appeal to the angry passions of his audience

urges the justice of putting the revolters to
death which as the latter remarked was no

thing to the purpose since the athenians were
not sitting in judgment but in deliberation of
which the proper end is expediency
it is evident that ignoratio elemchi may be
employed as well for the apparent refutation of
your opponents proposition as for the appa
rent establishment of your own for it is sub
stantially the same thing to prove what was not
denied or to disprove what was not asserted
the latter practice is not less common and it is

more offensive because it frequently amounts



elements of logic



to a personal affront in attributing to a person

opinions c which he perhaps holds in ab
horrence

thus when in a discussion one

party vindicates on the ground of general ex
pediency a particular instance of resistance to
government in a case of intolerable oppression

the opponent may gravely maintain that √¢Äúwe
ought not to do evil that good may come
a proposition which of course had hever been
denied the point in dispute being √¢Äúwhether
resistance in this particular case were doing
evil or not in this example it is to be re
marked and the remark will apply very gene

rally that the fallacy of petitio principii is
combined with that of ignoratio elemchi which
is a very common and successful practice viz
the sophist proves or disproves not the pro
position which is really in question but one
which so implies it as to proceed on the suppo
sition that it is already decided and can admit
of no doubt by this means his √¢Äúassumption

of the point in question√¢Äù is so indirect and ob
lique that it may easily escape notice and he
thus establishes practically his conclusion
at the very moment when he is withdrawing
your attention from it to another question
there are certain kinds of argument re

counted and named by logical writers which
we should by no means universally call fal
lacies but which when unfairly used and so

tradistinguished from √¢Äúargumentum ad rem√¢Äù
or according to others meaning probably the
very same thing √¢Äúadjudicium√¢Äù these have
all been described in the lax and popular lan
guage before alluded to but not scientifically
the √¢Äú argumentum ad hominem√¢Äù they say √¢Äúis
addressed to the peculiar circumstances cha

racter avowed opinions or past conduct of the
individual and therefore has a reference to

him only and does not bear directly and abso
lutely on the real question as the √¢Äúargumentum
ad rem does √¢Äù in like manner the √¢Äúargumen
tum ad cerecundiam√¢Äù is described as an appeal
to our reverence for some respected authority
some venerable institution c and the √¢Äúargu

mentum ad populum√¢Äù as an appeal to the preju
dices passions c of the multitude and so of
the rest along with these is usually enume
rated √¢Äúargumentum ad ignorantiam√¢Äù which is
here omitted as being evidently nothing more
than the employment of some kind of fallacy
in the widest sense of that word towards such

as are likely to be deceived by it it appears
then to speak rather more technically that

in the √¢Äúargumentum ad hominem√¢Äù the conclu



elements of logic

sion which actually is established is not the
absolute and general one in question but rela
tive and particular viz not that √¢Äúsuch and
such is the fact√¢Äù but that √¢Äúthis man is bound

to admit it in conformity to his principles of
reasoning or in consistency with his own con
duct situation√¢Äù c√¢Äù

such a conclusion it is

often both allowable and necessary to establish
in order to silence those who will not yield to fair
general argument or to convince those whose
weakness and prejudices would not allow them
 the √¢Äúargumentum ad hominem√¢Äù will often have the
effect of shifting the burden of proof not unjustly to the
adversary a common instance is the defence certainly
the readiest and most concise frequently urged by the
sportsman when accused of barbarity in sacrificing unof
fending hares or trout to his amusement he replies as he
may safely do to most of his assailants √¢Äúwhy do you feed
on the flesh of animals√¢Äù and that this answer presses

hard is manifested by its being usually opposed by a pal
pable falsehood viz that the animals which are killed for
food are sacrificed to our necessities though not only men
cam but a large proportion probably a great majority of
the human race actually do subsist in health and vigour
without flesh diet and the earth would support a much
greater human population were such a practice universal
when shamed out of this argument they sometimes urge
that the brute creation would overrun the earth if we did

not kill them for food an argument which if it were valid
at all would not justify their feeding on fish though if
fairly followed up it would justify swifts proposal for

keeping down the excessive population of ireland the
true reason viz that they eat flesh for the gratification of

the palate and have a taste for the pleasures of the table
though not for the sports of the field is one which they do
not like to assign

to assign to it its due weight it is thus that
our lord on many occasions silences the cavils

of the jews as in the vindication of healing
on the sabbath which is paralleled by the au
thorized practice of drawing out a beast that
has fallen into a pit all this as we have said

is perfectly fair provided it be done plainly
and avowedly but if you attempt to sub
stitute this partial and relative conclusion
for a more general one√¢Äîif you triumph as

having established your proposition absolutely
and universally from having established it in

reality only as far as it relates to your oppo
nent then you are guilty of a fallacy of the
kind which we are now treating of your con

your own account proposed to be proved the

conclusion they oppose it to one in which the
word is used in a widely different sense
 √¢Äúwhen the occasion or object in question is not such
as calls for or as is likely to excite in those particular
readers or hearers the emotions required it is a common
rhetorical artifice to turn their attention to some object
which will call forth these feelings and when they are too

much excited to be capable of judging calmly it will not
be difficult to turn their passions once roused in the direc

tion required and to make them view the case before them
in a very different light when the metal is heated it
may easily be moulded into the desired form thus vehe
ment indignation against some crime may be directed
against a person who has not been proved guilty of it
and vague declamations against corruption oppression c
or against the mischiefs of anarchy with highflown pa
negyrics on liberty rights of man c or on social order
justice the constitution law religion c will gradually
lead the hearers to take for granted without proof that
the measure proposed will lead to these evils or these ad
vantages and it will in consequence become the object of
groundless abhorrence or admiration for the very utter
ance of such words as have a multitude of what may be
called stimulating ideas associated with them will operate

like a charm on the minds especially of the ignorant and
unthinking and raise such a tumult of feeling as will ef
fectually blind their judgment so that a string of vague
abuse or panegyric will often have the effect of a train of
sound argument this artifice falls under the head of
√¢Äòirrelevant conclusion√¢Äô or ignoratio elemchi mentioned
in the treatise on fallacies

mr bentham has treated of

the employment of these √¢Äòpassionkindling appellatives
as he calls them under the head of √¢Äòfallacies of confu

other observations also occurring in that treatise will be

found very nearly to coincide with that which has been

√¢ß 

the fallacy of ignoratio elemchi is nowhere
more common than in protracted controversy

when one of the parties after having attempted

absolutely overthrows their own original asser

a practice of this nature is common in oral

√¢∫√¢∫ controversy especially viz that of combating



both your opponents premises alternately and
shifting the attack from the one to the other
without waiting to have either of them decided
upon before you quit it
it has been remarked above that one class
of the propositions that may be in this falla

cy substituted for the one required is the par

ticular for the universal nearly akin to this is
the very common case of proving something
to be possible when it ought to have been
proved highly probable or probable when it
ought to have been proved necessary or

which comes to the very same proving it to be
not necessary when it should have been proved

not probable or improbable when it should
have been proved impossible aristotle in
rhet book ii complains of this last branch of

the fallacy as giving an undue advantage to

the respondent many a guilty person owes his
acquittal to this the jury considering that the
evidence brought does not demonstrate the ab

absolute impossibility of his being innocent
though perhaps the chances are innumerable
against it

√¢ß 
of
similar to this case is that which may be fallacy
√¢ß
called the fallacy of objections ie showing

that there are objections against some plan

theory or system and thence inferring that it
should be rejected when that which ought to
have been proved is that there are more or
stronger objections against the receiving than
the rejecting of it this is the main and al
most universal fallacy of infidels and is that
of which men should be first and principally
warned this is also the strong hold of
bigoted antiinnovators who oppose all re
forms and alterations indiscriminately for

there never was nor will be any plan executed
or proposed against which strong and even

unanswerable objections may not be urged so
that unless the opposite objections be set in
the balance on the other side we can never

advance a step √¢Äúthere are objections√¢Äù said

tions against a racuum but one of them must
be true√¢Äù

the very same fallacy indeed is employed
on the other side by those who are for over
throwing whatever is established as soon as
they can prove an objection against it without
considering whether more and weightier ob
 this is as has been said the principal engine employed
by the adversaries of our faith they find numerous √¢Äúob
jections√¢Äù against variousparts of scripture to some of which
no satisfactory answer can be given and the incautious
hearer is apt while his attention is fixed on these to for
get that there are infinitely more and stronger objections
against the supposition that the christian religion is of
human origin and that where we cannot answer all objec
tions we are bound in reason and in candour to adopt the
hypothesis which labours under the least that the case
is as i have stated i am authorized to assume from this cir

cumstance that no complete and consistent account has
ever been given of the manner in which the christian reli
gion supposing it a human contrivance could have arisen
and prevailed as it did and yet this may obviously be
demanded with the utmost fairness of those who deny its
divine origin the religion exists that is the phenome
mon those who will not allow it to have come from god are

bound to solve the phenomenon on some other hypothesis

less open to objections they are not indeed called on to prove
that it actually did arise in this or that way but to sug
gest consistently with acknowledged facts some probable
way in which it may have arisen reconcileable with all the
eircumstances of the case

that infidels have never done

this though they have had near years to try
amounts to a confession that mo such hypothesis can be
devised which will not be open to greater objections than
he against christianity

jections may not lie against their own schemes
but their opponents have this decided advan
tage over them that they can urge with great

plausibility √¢Äúwe do not call upon you to re
ject at once whatever is objected to but merely
to suspend your judgment and not come to a
decision as long as there are reasons on both
sides now since there always will be reasons
on both sides this nondecision is practically
the very same thing as a decision in favour of

the eristing state of things the delay of trial
becomes equivalent to an acquittal√¢Äù

the respondent is to prove or disprove

some

be not elementary the charge is in fairness re
futed but the sophist may then earnestly
contend that some of those books are elemen

tary and thus keep out of sight the real ques
tion viz whether they are all so this is the
great art of the answerer of a book suppose
the main positions in any work to be irrefra

gable it will be strange if some illustration of
them or some subordinate part in short will
not admit of a plausible objection the oppo
nent then joins issue on one of these incidental
questions and comes forward with √¢Äúa reply√¢Äù
to such and such a work

hence the danger of ever advancing more
than can be well maintained since the refu

tation of that will often quash the whole a

guilty person may often escape by having too
much laid to his charge so he may also by
having too much evidence against him i e
some that is not in itself satisfactory thus a
prisoner may sometimes obtain acquittal by
showing that one of the witnesses against him

is an infamous informer and spy though per
haps if that part of the evidence had been
omitted the rest would have been sufficient for
conviction

cases of this nature might very well be re
ferred also to the fallacy formerly mentioned
of inferring the falsity of the conclusion from

the falsity of a premiss which indeed is very

of fallacies



closely allied to the present fallacy the real

question is √¢Äúwhether or not this conclusion
ought to be admitted the sophist confines
himself to the question √¢Äúwhether or not it is
established by this particular argument leaving
it to be inferred by the audience if he has car
ried his point as to the latter question that
the former is thereby decided
√¢ß 

it will readily be perceived that nothing is conclusion
supp√¢∫d
less conducive to the success of the fallacy in
question than to state clearly in the outset
either the proposition you are about to prove
or that which you ought to prove it answers
best to begin with the premises and to introduce
a pretty long chain of argument before you
arrive at the conclusion

th√£© careless hearer

takes for granted at the beginning that this
chain will lead to the conclusion required and
by the time you are come to the end he is
ready to take for granted that the conclusion
which you draw is the one required his idea
of the question having gradually become indis

tinct

this fallacy is greatly aided by the

common practice of suppressing the conclu
sion and leaving it to be supplied by the hearer
who is of course less likely to perceive whether

it be really that √¢Äúwhich was to be proved√¢Äù
than if it were distinctly stated the practice

therefore is at best suspicious and it is better
in general to avoid it and to give and require
a distinct statement of the conclusion in

jests

√¢ß 
before we dismiss the subject of fallacies
it may not be improper to mention the just and

ingenious remark that jests are fallacies
i e fallacies so palpable as not to be likely to

deceive any one but yet bearing just that re
semblance of argument which is calculated to
amuse by the contrast in the same manner
that a parody does by the contrast of its levity
with the serious production which it imitates
there is indeed something laughable even in
fallacies which are intended for serious con

viction when they are thoroughly exposed
there are several different kinds of joke and
raillery which will be found to correspond
with the different kinds of fallacy the pun
to take the simplest and most obvious case is
evidently in most instances a mock argument
founded on a palpable equivocation of the mid
dle term and the rest in like manner will be

found to correspond to the respective falla
cies and to be imitations of serious argument
it is probable indeed that all jests sports or

games rai√¢∫z properly so called will be
found on examination to be imitative of serious
transactions as of war or commerce but

to enter fully into this subject would be unsuit
able to the present occasion
i shall subjoin some general remarks on the

legitimate province of reasoning and on its
connection with inductive philosophy and with
rhetoric on which points much misappre
hension has prevailed tending to throw obscu
rity over the design and use of the science
under consideration

logic being concerned with the theory of
reasoning it is evidently necessary in order
to take a correct view of this science that all

misapprehensions should be removed relative
to the occasions on which the reasoningpro
cess is employed√¢Äîthe purposes it has in view
√¢Äîand the limits within which it is confined

simple and obvious as such questions may
appear to those who have not thought much on
the subject they will appear on further consi
deration to be involved in much perplexity and
obscurity from the vague and inaccurate lan
guage of many popular writers to the con
fused and incorrect notions that prevail respect

ing the reasoningprocess may be traced most
of the common mistakes respecting the science
of logic and much of the unsound and un
philosophical argumentation which is so often
to be met with in the works of ingenious
writers



on the province of reasoning

these errors have been incidentally ad

verted to in the foregoing part of this work
but it may be desirable before we dismiss the
subject to offer on these points some further
remarks which could not have been there in

troduced without too great an interruption to
the developement of the system little or no

thing indeed remains to be said that is not
implied in the principles which have been al
ready laid down but the results and applica
tions of those principles are liable in many
instances to be overlooked if not distinctly

pointed out these supplementary observa
tions will neither require nor admit of so sys
tematic an arrangement as has hitherto been

aimed at since they will be such as are sug
gested principally by the objections and mis
takes of those who have misunderstood or

partially entirely the nature of the logical
system





chapter i

of induction

√¢ß 
much has been said by some writers of the mistake of
opposing

superiority of the inductive to the syllogistic j√¢∫
method of seeking truth as if the two stood
opposed to each other and of the advantage
of substituting the organon of bacon for that
of aristotle c c which indicates a total
misconception of the nature of both there
is however the more excuse for the confusion

of thought which prevails on this subject be
cause eminent logical writers have treated or
at least have appeared to treat of induction as
a distinctkind of argument from the syllogism
which if it were it certainly might be con

trasted with the syllogism or rather the whole
syllogistic theory would fall to the ground
since one of the very first principles it esta
blishes is that all reasoning on whatever sub
ject is one and the same process which may
be clearly exhibited in the form of syllogisms
it is hardly to be supposed therefore that this
was the deliberate meaning of those writers

though it must be admitted that they have



on the province of reasoning

countenanced the error in question by their
inaccurate expressions this inaccuracy seems
chiefly to have arisen from a vagueness in the
use of the word induction which is sometimes

employed to designate the process of investiga
tion and of collecting facts sometimes the

deducing of an inference from those facts
the former of these processes i e that of ob
servation and experiment is undoubtedly dis
tinct from that which takes place in the syllo
gism but then it is not a process of argument

the latter again is an argumentative process
but then it is like all other arguments capable
of being syllogistically expressed and hence
induction has come to be regarded as a distinct

kind of argument from the syllogism this
fallacy cannot be more concisely or clearly
stated than in the technical form with which

we may now presume our readers to be fami
liar

√¢Äúinduction is distinct from syllogism
induction is a process of reasoning√¢Äù therefore

√¢Äúthere is a process of reasoning distinct from syl
logism√¢Äù

in the process of reasoning by which we
deduce from our observation of certain known

cases an inference with respect to unknown
ones we are employing a syllogism in barbara
with the major√¢∫ premiss suppressed that

being always substantially the same as it as
serts that √¢Äúwhat belongs to the individual or
individuals we have examined belongs to the
whole class under which they come √¢Äù e g
from an examination of the history of several
tyrannies and finding that each of them was of
short duration we conclude that √¢Äúthe same is

likely to be the case with all tyrannies the
suppressed major premiss being easily sup
plied by the hearer viz √¢Äú that what belongs
to the tyrannies in question is likely to belong
to all√¢Äù

induction therefore so far forth as it is an √¢∫

argument may of course be stated syllogisti
cally but so far forth as it is a process of in
quiry with a view to obtain the premises of
that argument it is of course out of the pro
vince of logic whether the induction in

this last sense has been sufficiently ample ie
takes

in a sufficient

number of individual

cases whether the character of those cases
 not the minor as aldrich represents it the instance
he gives will sufficiently prove this √¢Äúthis and that and
the other magnet attract iron therefore so do all√¢Äù if
this were as he asserts an enthymeme whose minor is
suppressed the only premiss which we could supply to fill
it up would be √¢Äúall magnets are this that and the other√¢Äù

has been correctly ascertained√¢Äîand how far
the individuals we have examined are likely to
resemble in this or that circumstance the rest
of the class c c are points that require
indeed great judgment and caution but this
judgment and caution are not to be aided by

logic because they are in reality employed
in deciding whether or not it is fair and allow
able to lay down your premises i e whether
you are authorized or not to assert that
√¢Äúwhat is true of the individuals you have exa
mined is true of the whole class√¢Äù and that
this or that is true of those individuals now

the rules of logic have nothing to do with the
truth or falsity of the premises but merely
teach us to decide not whether the premises

are fairly laid down but whether the conclu
sion follows fairly from the premises or not
√¢ß 



whether the premiss may fairly be assumed

 or not is a point which cannot be decided with
out a competent knowledge of the nature of the
subject e g in natural philosophy in which
the circumstances which in any case affect the

result are usually far more clearly ascertained
a single instance is often accounted a sufficient

induction e g having once ascertained that
an individual magnet will attract iron we are
authorized to conclude that this property is

of induction



universal in the affairs of human life on the

other hand a much fuller induction is required
as in the former example in short the de

gree of evidence for any proposition we origi
nally assume as a premiss whether the ex

pressed or the suppressed one is not to be
learned from logic nor indeed from any one
distinct science but is the province of what
ever science furnishes the subjectmatter of
your argument none but a politician can

judge rightly of the degree of evidence of a
proposition in politics a naturalist in natu

ral history c c eg from examination of √¢Äù
many horned animals as sheep cows c a
naturalist finds that they have cloven feet
now his skill as a naturalist is to be shewn in

judging whether these animals are likely to
resemble in the form of their feet all other

horned animals and it is the exercise of this

judgment together with the examination of in
dividuals that constitutes what is usually

meant by the inductive process which is that
by which we gain properly new truths and
which is not connected with logic being not

what is strictly called reasoning but investiga
tion but when this major premiss is granted
him and is combined with the minor viz that
the animals he has examined have cloven feet

then he draws the conclusion logically viz
p 



on the province of reasoning

that √¢Äúthe feet of all horned animals are cloven√¢Äù

again if from several times meeting with ill
luck on a friday any one concluded that fri
day universally is an unlucky day one would
object to his induction and yet it would not
be as an argument illogical since the conclu

sion follows fairly if you grant his implied pre
miss that the events which happened on those
particular fridays are such as must happen on
all fridays but we should object to his laying
down this premiss and therefore should justly
say that his induction was faulty though his
argument were correct

and here it may be remarked that the ordi
 nary rule for fair argument riz that in an
induction
enthymeme the suppressed premiss should be

the more
doubtful pre

miss sup

always the one of whose truth least doubt can
exist is not observed in induction for the

premiss which is usually the more doubtful of
the two is in that the major it being in few
cases quite certain that the individuals respect
ing which some point has been ascertained are
to be fairly regarded as a sample of the whole
class the major premiss nevertheless is seldom
expressed for the reason just given that it is
 i have selected an instance in which induction is the

only ground we have to rest on no reason that i know
of having ever been assigned that could have led us to
conjecture this curious fact a priori

of induction



easily understood as being mutatis mutandis
the same in every induction
what has been said of induction will equally
apply to example which differs from it only
in having a singular instead of a general com
clusion e g in the instance above if the
conclusion had been drawn not respecting
tyrannies in general but respecting this or that

tyranny that it was not likely to be lasting
each of the cases adduced to prove this would
have been called an example



chapter ii
on the discovery of truth



√¢ß 

whether it is by a process of reasoning
that new truths are brought to light is a

question which seems to be decided in the ne
gative by what has been already said though
many eminent writers seem to have taken for

granted the affirmative it is perhaps in a
great measure a dispute concerning the use of
words but it is not for that reason either un

interesting or unimportant since an inaccurate
use of language may often in matters of sci
ence lead to confusion of thought and to er
roneous conclusions and in the present
instance much of the undeserved contempt
which has been bestowed on the logical sys
tem may be traced to this source for when any
one has laid down that √¢Äúreasoning is import

ant in the discovery of truth√¢Äù and that √¢Äúlogic
is of no service in the discovery of truth√¢Äù each
of which propositions is true in a certain sense
of the terms employed but not in the same sense
he is naturally led to conclude that there are

processes of reasoning to which the syllogistic
theory does not apply and of course to mis
conceive altogether the nature of the science

discovery of truth



in maintaining the negative side of the
above question three things are to be premised
first that it is not contended that discoveries

of any kind of truth can be made or at least
are usually made without reasoning only

that reasoning is not the whole of the process
nor the whole of that which is important
therein secondly that reasoning shall be
taken in the sense not of every exercise of the
reason but of argumentation in which we
have all along used it and in which it has been
defined by all the logical writers viz √¢Äúfrom
certain granted propositions to infer another

proposition as the consequence of them √¢Äù
thirdly that by a √¢Äúnew truth√¢Äù be understood
something neither expressly nor virtually as
serted before not implied and involved in
anything already known
to prove then this point demonstratively
becomes in this manner perfectly easy for
since all reasoning in the sense above defined

may be resolved into syllogisms and since
even the objectors to logic make it a subject
of complaint that in a syllogism the premises
do virtually assert the conclusion it follows
at once that no new truth as above defined

can be elicited by any process of reasoning
it is on this ground indeed that the justly
celebrated author of the philosophy of rhetoric
objects to the syllogism altogether as neces



on the province of reasoning

sarily involving a petitio principii an objection
which of course he would not have been dis

posed to bring forward had he perceived that
whether well or illfounded it lies against all
arguments whatever
√¢Ä¢ had he been aware that a syllogism is no

distinct kind of argument otherwise than in
form but is in fact any argument whatever

stated regularly and at full length he would
have obtained a more correct view of the ob

ject of all reasoning which is merely to ex
pand and unfold the assertions wrapt up as it
were and implied in those with which we set

out and to bring a person to perceive and ac
knowledge the full force of that which he has
admitted√¢Äîto contemplate it in various points
of view to admit in one shape what he has
already admitted in another and to give up
and disallow whatever is inconsistent with it

nor is it always a very easy task even to
bring before the mind the several bearings
the various applications√¢Äîof any one proposi
tion a common term comprehends several
often numberless individuals and these often

in some respects widely differing from each

other and no one can be on each occasion of
his employing such a term attending to and
fixing his mind on each of the individuals or

even of the species so comprehended

it is to

be remembered too that both division and



discovery of truth

generalization are in a great degree arbitrary
i e that we may both divide the same genus
on several different principles and may refer
the same species to several different classes
according to the nature of the discourse and
drift of the argument each of which classes
will furnish a distinct middle term for an ar

gument according to the question e g if we

aristotle and other logical writers have treat

out certain tracks as it were which are to be

pursued in searching for middle terms in each
argument respectively it being essential that
we should generalize on a right principle with
a view to the question before us or in other
words that we should abstract that portion of

any object presented to the mind which is
important to the argument in hand there
are expressions in common use which have a
reference to this caution such as √¢Äúthis is a

question not as to the nature of the object but

vided we do but distinguish there certainly

are two kinds of √¢Äúnew truth and of √¢Äúdis√¢∫n
covery√¢Äù if we take those words in the widest
sense in which they are ever used first
such truths as were before they were disco
vered absolutely unknown being not implied
by anything we previously knew though we
might perhaps suspect them as probable such
are all matters of fact strictly so called when
first made known to one who had not any such
previous knowledge as would enable him to
ascertain them √£† priori ie by reasoning 
as if we inform a man that we have a colony
at botany bay or that the earth is at such a
distance from the sun or that platina is hea
vier than gold the communication of this
kind of knowledge is most usually and most

strictly called information we gain it from obinformation
servation and from testimony no mere internal
workings of our own minds except when the
mind itself is the very object to be observed
or mere discussions in words will make these

known to us though there is great room for

sagacity in judging what testimony to admit and
forming conjectures that may lead to profitable
observation and to experiments with a view to
it



the other class of discoveries is of a very dif
ferent nature that which may be elicited by

reasoning and consequently is implied in that



instruction

on the province of reasoning

which we already know we assent to on that
ground and not from observation or testimony
to take a geometrical truth upon trust or to
attempt to ascertain it by observation would
betray a total ignorance of the nature of the
science in the longest demonstration the
mathematical teacher seems only to lead us to
make use of our own stores and point out to
us how much we had already admitted and
in the case of many ethical propositions we
assent at first hearing though perhaps we had
never heard or thought of the proposition be
fore so also do we readily assent to the testi

mony of a respectable man who tells us that
our troops have gained a victory but how dif
ferent is the nature of the assentin the two cases

in the latter we are ready to thank the man for
his information as being such as no wisdom
or learning would have enabled us to ascertain
in the former we usually exclaim √¢Äúvery true√¢Äù
√¢Äúthat is a valuable and just remark that ne
ver struck me before implying at once our
practical ignorance of it and also our con
sciousness that we possess in what we already
know the means to ascertain the truth of it

that we have a right in short to bear our tes
timony to its truth
to all practical purposes indeed a truth of

this description may be as completely un
known to a man as the other but as soon as

discovery of truth



it is set before him and the argument by
which it is connected with his previous motions
is made clear to him he recognises it as some

thing conformable to and contained in his
former belief

it is not improbable that platos doctrine of
reminiscence arose from a hasty extension of
what he had observed in this class to all ac

quisition of knowledge whatever his theory
of ideas served to confound together matters of
fact respecting the nature of things which may
be perfectly new to us with propositions rela
ting to our own motions and modes of thought
or to speak perhaps more correctly our own
arbitrary signs which propositions must be
contained and implied in those very complex
notions themselves and whose truth is a con

formity not to the nature of things but to our
own hypothesis such are all propositions in

pure mathematics and many in ethics viz
those which involve no assertion as to real

matters of fact it has been rightly remarked√¢Äù
that mathematical propositions are not pro
perly true or false in the same sense as any

proposition respecting real fact is so called
and hence the truth such as it is of such pro
positions is necessary and eternal since it
amounts only to this that any complex notion
 dugald stewarts philosophy vol ii



on the province of reasoning

which you have arbitrarily framed must be
exactly conformable to itself the proposition
that √¢Äúthe belief in a future state combined

with a complete devotion to the present life is
not consistent with the character of prudence
would be mot at all the less true if a future

state were a chimera and prudence a quality
which was nowhere met with nor would the

truth of the mathematicians conclusion be
shaken that √¢Äúcircles are to each other as the
squares of their diameters√¢Äù should it be found
that there never had been a circle or a square
conformable to the definition in rerum na
tur√£°

the ethical proposition just instanced is
one of those which locke calls √¢Äútrifling√¢Äù be

cause the predicate is merely a part of the com
plex idea implied by the subject and he is
right if by √¢Äútrifling√¢Äù he means that it gives
 hence the futility of the attempt of clarke and others
to demonstrate in the mathematical sense the existence of

a deity this can only be done by covertly assuming in
the premises the very point to be proved no matter of
fact can be mathematically demonstrated though it may
be proved in such a manner as to leave no doubt on the
mind e g i have no more doubt that i met such and
such a man in this or that place yesterday than that the
angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles but the
kind of certainty i have of these two truths is widely dif
ferent to say that i did not meet the man would be false

indeed but it would not be anything inconceivable self
contradictory and absurd but it would be so to deny the
equality of the angles of a triangle to two right angles

not strictly speaking any information but he
should consider that to remind a man of what
he had not and what he would not have

thought of may be practically as valuable as
giving him information and that most propo
sitions in the best sermons and all in pure
mathematics are of the description which he
censulres

it is indeed rather remarkable that he should
speak so often of building morals into a de
monstrative science and yet speak so slight
ingly of those very propositions to which we
must absolutely confine ourselves in order to
give to ethics even the appearance of such a
science for the instant you come to an asser
tion respecting a matter of fact as that √¢Äúmen

i e actually existing men are bound to prac
tise virtue√¢Äù or √¢Äúare liable to many temptations√¢Äù
you have stepped off the ground of strict de
monstration just as when you proceed to
practical geometry

but to return it is of the utmost importl√¢∫√¢∫
ance to distinguish these two kinds of disco
very of truth to the former as i have
said the word √¢Äúinformation√¢Äù is most strictly
applied the communication of the latter is

more properly called √¢Äúinstruction√¢Äù i speak of
the usual practice for it would be going too
far to pretend that writers are uniform and



on the province of reasoning

consistent in the use of these or of any other

term we say that the historian gives us in
formation respecting past times the traveller

respecting foreign countries on the other
hand the mathematician gives instruction in
the principles of his science the moralist in
structs us in our duties and we generally use
the expressions √¢Äúa wellinformed man√¢Äù and
√¢Äúa wellinstructed man√¢Äù in a sense conforma
ble to that which has been here laid down

however let the words be used as they may
the things are evidently different and ought to
be distinguished it is a question compara
tively unimportant whether the term √¢Äúdisco
very√¢Äù shall or shall not be extended to the

eliciting of those truths which being implied
in our previous knowledge may be established
by mere strict reasoning similar verbal
questions indeed might be raised respecting
many other cases eg one has forgotten i e
cannot recollect the name of some person or
place perhaps we even try to think of it but
in vain at last some one reminds us and we

instantly recognise it as the one we wanted to
recollect it may be asked was this in our
mind or not the answer is that in one
sense it was and in another sense it was not

or again suppose there is a vein of metal on
a mans estate which he does not know of 

discovery of truth



is it part of his possessions or not and when
he finds it out and works it does he then ac

quire a new possession or not certainly not
in the same sense as if he has a fresh estate

bequeathed to him which he had formerly no
right to but to all practical purposes it is a
new possession this case indeed may serve
as an illustration of the one we have been con

sidering and in all these cases if the real

distinction be understood the verbal question
will not be of much consequence to use one
more illustration reasoning has been aptly
compared to the piling together blocks of
stone on each of which as on a pedestal a
man can raise himself a small and but a small

height above the plain but which when skil
fully built up will form a flight of steps which
will raise him to a great elevation now to
pursue this analogy when the materials are
all ready to the builders hand the blocks ready

dug and brought his work resembles one of
the two kinds of discovery just mentioned
viz that to which we have assigned the name
of instruction but if his materials are to be

entirely or in part provided by himself√¢Äîif
he himself is forced to dig fresh blocks from

the quarry this corresponds to the other kind
of discovery

r√¢∫up


i have hitherto spoken of the employment
of argument in the establishment of those hy

pothetical truths as they may be called

which relate only to our own abstract notions
it is not however meant to be insinuated that

there is no room for reasoning in the establish
ment of a matter of fact but the other class of
truths have first been treated of because in

discussing subjects of that kind the process of
reasoning is always the principal and often the
only thing to be attended to if we are but cer
tain and clear as to the meaning of the terms

whereas when assertions respecting real exist

ence are introduced we have the additional
and more important business of ascertaining

and keeping in mind the degree of eridence
for those facts since otherwise our conclu
sions could not be relied on however accurate

our reasoning but undoubtedly we may by

reasoning arrive at matters of fact if we have
matters of fact to set out with as data only
that it will very often happen that √¢Äúfrom cer
tain facts√¢Äù as campbell remarks √¢Äúwe draw

only probable conclusions√¢Äù because the
other premiss introduced which he over
looked is only probable he observed that
in such an instance for example as the one

lately given we infer from the certainly that

discovery of truth



such and such tyrannies have been shortlived
the probability that others will be so and he
did not consider that there is an understood

premiss which is essential to the argument
rig that all tyrannies will resemble those we

have already observed which being only of a
probable character must attach the same

degree of uncertainty to the conclusion an

individual fact is not unfrequently elicited by
skilfully combining and reasoning from those
already known of which many curious cases
occur in the detection of criminals by officers

of justice and barristers who acquire by prac
tice such dexterity in that particular depart
ment as to draw sometimes the right conclu
sion from data which might be in the posses
sion of others without being applied to the
same use

in all cases of the establishment of

a general fact from induction that general fact
as has been formerly remarked is ultimately
established by reasoning e g bakewell the
celebrated cattlebreeder observed in a great
number of individual beasts a tendency to fat
ten readily and in a great number of others the
 and the doubtfulness is multiplied if both premises
are uncertain for since it is only on the supposition of
both premises being true that we can calculate on the
truth of the conclusion we must state in numbers the

chances against each premiss being true and then multi

ply these together to judge of the degree of evidence of the
conclusion

absence of this constitution in every indivi
dual of the former description he observed a
certain peculiar make though they differed
widely in size colour c those of the latter
description differed no less in various points but
agreed in being of a different make from the
others these facts were his data from which

combining them with the general principle

that nature is steady and uniform in her pro
ceedings he logically drew the conclusion that
beasts of the specified make have universally
a peculiar tendency to fattening but then
his principal merit consisted in making the
observations and in so combining them as to
abstract from each of a multitude of cases dif
fering widely in many respects the circum
stances in which they all agreed and also in
conjecturing skilfully how far those circum
stances were likely to be found in the whole
class the making of such observations and still
more the combination abstraction and judg
ment employed are what men commonly mean
as was above observed when they speak of
induction and these operations are certainly
distinct from reasoning the same observa
tions will apply to numberless other cases as

for instance to the discovery of the law of
√¢Äúvis inertia√¢Äù and the other principles of na
tural philosophy
but to what class it may be asked should

discovery of truth



be referred the discoveries thus made all

would agree in calling them when first ascer
tained √¢Äúnew truths√¢Äù in the strictest sense

of the word which would seem to imply their
belonging to the class which may be called by
way of distinction √¢Äúphysical discoveries and

yet their being ultimately established by rea
soning would seem according to the forego
ing rule to refer them to the other class viz

what may be called √¢Äúlogical discoveries √¢∫pir
since whatever is established by reasoning
must have been containcid and virtually assert
ed in the premises

in answer to this it is to

be observed that they certainly do belong to

the latter class relatively to a person who is in
possession of the data but to him who is not
they are new truths of the other class for it
is to be remembered that the words √¢Äúdisco

very√¢Äù and √¢Äúnew truths√¢Äù are necessarily rela
tive there may be a proposition which is to
one person absolutely known to another viz
one to whom it has never occurred though he
is in possession of all the data from which it
may be proved it will be when he comes to

perceive it by a process of instruction what
we have called a logical discovery to a third
viz one who is ignorant of these data it will

be absolutely unknown and will have been
when made known to him a perfectly and

properly new trutha piece of information



on the province of reasoning

√¢Äîa physical discovery as we have called it
to the philosopher therefore who arrives at
the discovery by reasoning from his observa
tions and from established principles combined
with them the discovery is of the former
class to the multitude probably of the latter

as they will have been most likely not possessed
of all his data

it follows from what has been said that in

mathematics and in such ethical propositions
as we were lately speaking of we do not allow
the possibility of any but a logical discovery 

i e no proposition of that class can be true
which was not implied in the definitions and
axioms we set out with which are the first

principles for since these propositions do not
profess to state any matter of fact the only
truth they can possess consists in conformity
to the original principles to one therefore

who knows these principles such propositions
 it may be worth while in this place to define what is
properly to be called knowledge it implies three things
st firm belief dly of what is true dly on sufficient
grounds if any one e g is in doubt respecting one of
euclids demonstrations he cannot be said to know the

proposition proved by it if again he is fully convinced
of any thing that is not true he is mistaken in supposing

himself to know it lastly if two persons are each fully
confident one that the moon is inhabited and the other

that it is not though one of these opinions must be true
neither of them could properly be said to know the truth
nce he cannot have sufficient proof of it



discovery of truth

are truths already implied since they may be
developed to him by reasoning if he is not
defective in the discursive faculty and again
to one who does not understand those princi

ples ie is not master of the definitions such
propositions are absolutely unmeaning on
the other hand propositions relating to mat

ters of fact may be indeed implied in what he
already knew as he who knows the climate
of the alps the andes c c has virtually
admitted the general fact that √¢Äúthe tops of
mountains are comparatively cold but as these

possess an absolute and physical truth they

may also be absolutely √¢Äúnew√¢Äù their truth
not being implied by the mere terms of the pro

positions the truth or falsity of any propo
sition concerning a triangle is implied by the

meaning of that and of the other geometrical
terms whereas though one may understand

in the ordinary sense of that word the full
meaning of the terms √¢Äúplanet√¢Äù and √¢Äúinha
bited√¢Äù and of all the other terms in the lan
guage he cannot thence be certain that the
moon is or is not inhabited



√¢ß 

it has probably been the source of much

perplexity that the term √¢Äútrue has been ap
plied indiscriminately to two such different

classes of propositions the term definition is



on the province of reasoning

used with the same laxity and much confu
sion has thence resulted

such definitions as

the mathematical must imply every attribute
that belongs to the thing defined because that
thing is merely our meaning which meaning
the definition lays down whereas real sub
stances having an independent existence may

possess innumerable qualities as locke ob
serves not implied in the meaning we attach
to their names or as locke expresses it in
our ideas of them
real and no
minal defini
tions

√¢Äútheir nominal essence to use his language
is not the same as their real essence whereas
the nominal cssence and the real essence of a
circle c are the same a mathematical

definition therefore cannot properly be called
true since it is not properly a proposition√¢Äù
any more than an article in a dictionary but
merely an explanation of the meaning of a
term perhaps in definitions of this class it
might be better to substitute as aristotle
usually does the imperative mood for the indi
cative thus bringing them into the form of
postulates for the definitions and the postu
 i mean in this place that expression of a definition in
which the name is conjoined with that which is properly
speaking the definition of it in the form of a proposition
as eg √¢Äúa triangle is a plane superficial figure bounded
by three sides√¢Äù the words in italics are what strictly
speaking constitute the definition but what i am here
speaking of is the whole sentence

discovery of truth



lates in mathematics differ in little or nothing
but the form of expression eg √¢Äúlet a four

sided figure of equal sides and right angles be
called a square√¢Äù would clearly imply that such
a figure is conceivable and that the writer in
tended to employ that term to signify such a
figure which is precisely all that is meant to
be asserted

if indeed a mathematical writer

mean to assert that the ordinary sense of the
term is that which he has given that certainly
is a proposition which must be either true or
false but in defining a new term though the
term indeed may be ill chosen and improper
or the definition may be selfcontradictory
and consequently unintelligible the words
√¢Äútrue√¢Äù and √¢Äúfalse√¢Äù do not apply the same

may be said of what are called nominal defini
tions of other things i e those which merely
explain the meaning of the word viz they
can be true or false only when they profess

and so far as they profess to give the ordinary
and established meaning of the term but
those which are called real definitions viz

which unfold the nature of the thing which

they may do in various degrees to these the
epithet √¢Äútrue√¢Äù may be applied and to make
out such a definition will often be the very

end not as in mathematics the beginning of
our study

in mathematics there is no such distinction



on the province of reasoning

between nominal and real definition the mean

ing of the term and the nature of the thing
being one and the same so that no correct de
finition whatever of any mathematical term can
be devised which shall not imply every thing

which belongs to the term
√¢ß 

a√¢∫yd when it is asked then whether such great
 discoveries as have been made in natural
philosophy were accomplished or can be ac
complished by reasoning the inquirer should
be reminded that the question is ambiguous

it may be answered in the affirmative if by
√¢Äúreasoning√¢Äù is meant to be included the as

sumption of premises to the right performance
of that work is requisite not only in many
cases the ascertainment of facts and of the
degree of evidence for doubtful propositions
in which observation and experiment will
often be indispensable but also a skilful selec
tion and combination of known facts and prin
ciples such as implies amongst other things
the exercise of that powerful abstraction which

seizes the common circumstances√¢Äîthe point
of agreement√¢Äîin a number of otherwise dis
similar individuals and it is in this that the

greatest genius is shown but if √¢Äúreasoning√¢Äù
be understood in the limited sense in which it

is usually defined then we must answer in the





discovery of truth

negative and reply that such discoveries ar

made by means of reasoning combined with
other operations



in the process we have been speaking of
there is much reasoning throughout and
thence the whole has been carelessly called a
√¢Äúprocess of reasoning√¢Äù
it is not indeed any just ground of com

plaint that the word reasoning is used in two
senses but that the two senses are perpetually
confounded together and hence it is that some

logical writers fancied that reasoning viz
that which logic treats of was the method of

discovering truth and that so many other
writers have accordingly complained of logic
for not accomplishing that end urging that
√¢Äúsyllogism i e reasoning though they
overlooked the coincidence never established
any thing that is strictly speaking unknown to
him who has granted the premises and pro
posing the introduction of a certain √¢Äúrational

logic√¢Äù to accomplish this purpose i e to di
rect the mind in the progress of investigation
supposing that some such system could be
devised√¢Äîthat it could even be brought into a

scientific form which he must be more san
guine than scientific who expects√¢Äîthat it
were of the greatest conceivable utilityand
that it should be allowed to bear the name of

√¢Äúlogic√¢Äù since it would not be worth while



on the province of reasoning

to contend about a name still it would not as
these writers seem to suppose have the same
object proposed with the aristotelian logic
nor be in any respect a rival to that system
a plough may be a much more ingenious and
valuable instrument than a flail but it never
can be substituted for it

those discoveries ofgeneral laws of nature
c of which we have been speaking being of
that character which we have described by the
name of √¢Äúlogical discoveries√¢Äù to him who is

in possession of all the premises from which they
are deduced but being to the multitude who
are unacquainted with many of those premises
strictly √¢Äúnew truths√¢Äù hence it is that men
in general give to the general facts and to

them most peculiarly the name of discoveries
for to themselves they are such in the strictest
sense the premises from which they were
inferred being not only originally unknown to

them but frequently remaining unknown to the
very last eg the general conclusion concern
ing cattle which bakewell made known is

what most agriculturists and many others
also are acquainted with but the premises
he set out with viz the facts respecting this
that and the other individual ox the ascer

tainment of which facts was his first discocery
these are what few know or care to know

with any exact particularity

discovery of trutii



and it may be added that these discoveries √¢∫
of particular facts which are the immediate re
sult of observation are in themselves uninte
resting and insignificant till they are combined
so as to lead to a grand general result those
who on each occasion watched the motions

and registered the times of occultation of ju
piters satellites little thought perhaps them
selves what magnificent results they were pre
paring the way for so that there is an addi
tional cause which has confined the term dis

covery to these grand general conclusions
and as was just observed they are to the ge
nerality of men perfectly new truths in the

strictest sense of the word not being implied
in any previous knowledge they possessed
very often it will happen indeed that the con
clusion thus drawn will amount only to a pro
bable conjecture which conjecture will dictate

to the inquirer such an experiment or course of
experiments as will fully establish the fact
thus sir h davy from finding that the flame
of hydrogen gas was not communicated through
a long slender tube conjectured that a shorter
but still slenderer tube would answer the same

purpose this led him to try the experiments
in which by continually shortening the tube
and at the same time lessening its bore he

arrived at last at the wiregauze of his safety

lamp

s

on the province of reasoning

it is to be observed also that whatever cre

dit is conveyed by the word √¢Äúdiscovery√¢Äù to
him who is regarded as the author of it is well
deserved by those who skilfully select and com
bine known truths especially such as have
been long and generally known so as to elicit

important and hitherto unthoughtof conclu
sions theirs is the master mind apxrexrovizh
√¢£p√¢∫nsis whereas men of very inferior powers

may sometimes by immediate observation dis√¢Äì
cover perfectly new facts empirically and thus
be of service in furnishing materials to the
others to whom they stand in the same rela
tion to recur to a former illustration as the
brickmaker or stonequarrier to the architect
it is peculiarly creditable to adam smith and to
mr malthus that the data from which they

drew such important conclusions had been in
every ones hands for centuries

as for mathematical discoveries they as
we have before said must always be of the de
scription to which we have given the name of
√¢Äúlogical discoveries√¢Äù since to him who pro
perly comprehends the meaning of the mathe
matical terms and to no other are the truths

themselves properly speaking intelligible
those results are implied in his previous know

ledge since they are logically deducible there
from it is not however meant to be implied
that mathematical discoveries are c√•øected by

discovery of trutii

pure reasoning and by that singly



for

though there is not here as in physics any

exercise of judgment as to the degree of evi
dence of the premises nor any experiments

and observations yet there is the same call for
skill in the selection and combination of the pre
mises in such a manner as shall be best calcu

lated to lead to a new that is unperceived and

wnthoughtof conclusion
in following indeed and taking in a demon
stration nothing is called for but pure reason
ing but the assumption of premises is not a
part of reasoning in the strict and technical
sense of that term accordingly there are

many who can follow a mathematical demon
stration or any other train of argument who
would not succeed well in framing one of their
own√¢Äù

√¢ß 
for both kinds of discovery then the logiq√¢∫√¢∫ns
cal as well as the physical certain operations 
are requisite beyond those which can fairly be
connected

comprehended under the strict sense of the

word √¢Äúreasoning√¢Äù in the logical is required
a skilful selection and combination of known

truths in the physical we must employ in
 hence the student must not confine himself to this

passive kind of employment if he would truly become a
mathematician



on the province of reasoning

addition generally speaking to that process
observation and experiment it will generally
happen that in the study of nature and uni
versally in all that relates to matters of fact

both kinds of investigation will be united ie
some of the facts or principles you reason from
as premises must be ascertained by observa
tion or as in the case of the safetylamp the
ultimate conclusion will need confirmation from
experience so that both physical and logical
discovery will take place in the course of the
same process we need not therefore wonder
that the two are so perpetually confounded in
mathematics on the other hand and in great
part of the discussions relating to ethics and
jurisprudence there being no room for any

physical discovery whatever we have only to
make a skilful use of the propositions in our
possession to arrive at every attainable re
sult

the investigation however of the latter

class of subjects differs in other points also
from that of the former for setting aside the

circumstance of our having in these no ques
tion as to factsno room for observationthere is also a considerable difference in what

may be called in both instances the process

of logical investigation the premises on which
we proceed being of so different a nature in the
two cases

discovery of truth



to take the example of mathematics the n√¢∫
definitions which are the principles of our 
reasoning are very few and the axioms still
fewer and both are for the most part laid
down and placed before the student in the outset
the introduction of a new definition or axiom
being of comparatively rare occurrence at
wide intervals and with a formal statement be
sides which there is no room for doubt concern
ing either on the other hand in all reason
ings which regard matters of fact we introduce
almost at every step fresh and fresh proposi
tions to a very great number which had not
been elicited in the course of our reasoning
but are taken for granted viz facts and laws
of nature which are here the principles of our
reasoning and maxims or √¢Äúelements of be
lief√¢Äù which answer to the axioms in mathe
matics if at the opening of a treatise for
example on chemistry on agriculture on
political economy c the author should
make as in mathematics a formal statement of
all the propositions he intended to assume as

granted throughout the whole work both he
and his readers would be astonished at the

number and of these many would be only
probable and there would be much room for
doubt as to the degree of probability and for
judgment in ascertaining that degree
moreover mathematical axioms are always

employed precisely in the same simple form 
eg the axiom that √¢Äúthings equal to the same
are equal to one another√¢Äù is cited whenever
there is need in those very words whereas

the maxims employed in the other class of
subjects admit of and require continual mo
difications in the application of them e g

√¢Äúthe stability of the laws of nature√¢Äù which is
our constant assumption in inquiries relating
to natural philosophy assumes many different
shapes and in some of them does not possess
the same absolute certainty as in others e g
when from having always observed a certain

sheep ruminating we infer that this individual
sheep will continue to ruminate we assume

that √¢Äúthe property which has hitherto belonged
to this sheep will remain unchanged√¢Äù when we
infer the same property of all sheep we assume

that √¢Äúthe property which belongs to this indivi
dual belongs to the whole species if on com
paring sheep with some other kinds of horned

animals and finding thatall agree in ruminating
we infer that √¢Äúall horned animals ruminate√¢Äù we

assume that √¢Äúthe whole of a genus or class are
likely to agree in any point wherein many spe

cies of that genus agree√¢Äù or in other words
√¢Äúthat if one of two properties c has often

been found accompanied by another and never
without it the former will be universally ac
companied by the latter√¢Äù now all these are

discovery of truth



merely different forms of the maxim that
√¢Äúnature is uniform in her operations√¢Äù which

it is evident varies in expression in almost
every different case where it is applied and

admits of every degree of evidence from abso
lute moral certainty to mere conjecture
the same may be said of an infinite number
of principles and maxims appropriated to and
employed in each particular branch of study
hence all such reasonings are in comparison

of mathematics very complex requiring so
much more than that does beyond the process
of merely deducing the conclusion logically
from the premises so that it is no wonder

that the longest mathematical demonstration
should be so much more easily constructed and
understood than a much shorter train of just

reasoning concerning real facts the former
has been aptly compared to a long and steep

but even and regular flight of steps which tries
the breath and the strength and the perse
verance only while the latter resembles a
short but rugged and uneven ascent up a pre

cipice which requires a quick eye agile limbs
and a firm step and in which we have to
tread now on this side now on that√¢Äîever con

of pure reasoning in one of the longer of eu

argumentative treatise on some other subject
occupying perhaps a considerable volume
as for those ethical and legal reasonings
which were lately mentioned as in some re
spects resembling those of mathematics viz
such as keep clear of all assertions respecting
facts they have this difference that not only

men are not so completely agreed respecting
the maxims and principles of ethics and law
but the meaning also of each term cannot be

absolutely and for ever fixed by an arbitrary

definition on the contrary a great part of our
labour consists in distinguishing accurately the
various senses in which men employ each
term ascertaining which is the most proper

√¢Äîand taking care to avoid confounding them
together



chapter iii

of inference and proof

√¢ß 
since it appears from what has been said that
universally a man must possess something else


besides the reasoningfaculty in order to apply
that faculty properly to his own purpose what

ever that purpose may be it may be inquired
whether some theory could not be made out
respecting those √¢Äúother operations√¢Äù and √¢Äúintel
lectual processes distinct from reasoning
which it is necessary for us sometimes to em

ploy in the investigation of truth√¢Äù and whe
ther rules could not be laid down for conduct

ing them
something has indeed been done in this 

way by more than one writer and more might √¢Äú
probably be accomplished by one who should
fully comprehend and carefully bear in mind

the principles of logic properly so called but

it would hardly be possible to build up any
thing like a regular science respecting these
matters such as logic is with respect to the
 d stewart



on the province of reasoning

theory of reasoning it may be useful how
ever to observe that these √¢Äúother operations√¢Äù
of which we have been speaking and which
are preparatory to the exercise of reasoning
are of two kinds according to the nature of the
end proposed for reasoning comprehends in
ferring and proving which are not two dif
ferent things but the same thing regarded in
two different points of view like the road
from london to york and the road from york

to london he who infers√¢Äù proves and he
who proves infers but the word √¢Äúinfer√¢Äù fixes
the mind first on the premiss and then on the
conclusion the word √¢Äúprove√¢Äù on the con
trary leads the mind from the conclusion to
the premiss

hence the substantives derived

from these words respectively are often used
to express that which on each occasion is last

in the mind inference being often used to sig
nify the conclusion i e proposition inferred
and proof the premiss we say also √¢Äúhow
do you prove that and √¢Äúwhat do you infer
jrom that√¢Äù which sentences would not be so

properly expressed if we were to transpose
those verbs

one might therefore define

proving √¢Äúthe assigning of a reason or argu
ment for the support of a given proposition
and √¢Äúinferring√¢Äù the √¢Äú deduction of a conclu
 i mean of course when the word is understood to
imply correct inference



inference and proof



sion from given premises√¢Äù in the one case our
conclusion is given ie set before us and we
have to seek for arguments in the other our
premises are given and we have to seek for a
conclusion i e to put together our own pro
positions and try what will follow from them
or to speak more logically in the one case
we seek to refer the subject of which we
would predicate something to a class to which

that predicate will affirmatively or negatively
apply in the other we seek to find compre
hended in the subject of which we have predi
cated something some other term to which
that predicate had not been before applied
each of these is a definition of reasoning
√¢ß 

to infer then is the business of the philo √¢∫
sopher to prove of the advocate the former 
from the great mass of known and admitted
truths wishes to elicit any valuable additional
truth whatever that has been hitherto unper
ceived and perhaps without knowing with
certainty what will be the terms of his con
clusion thus the mathematician e g seeks
to ascertain what is the ratio of circles to each
 √¢Äúproving√¢Äù may be compared to the act of putting
away any article into the proper receptacle of goods of
that description √¢Äúinferring√¢Äù to that of bringing out the
article when needed



on the province of reasoning

other or what is the line whose square will be
equal to a given circle the advocate on the
other hand has a proposition put before him
which he is to maintain as well as he can his

business therefore is to find middle terms
which is the inventio of cicero the philoso

phers to combine and select known facts or
principles suitably for gaining from them con
clusions which though implied in the pre
mises were before unperceived in other
words for making √¢Äúlogical discoveries√¢Äù
such are the respective preparatory pro

cesses in these two branches of study they
are widely differentthey arise from and
generate very different habits of mind and
require a very different kind of training and
precept the lawyer or controversialist
or in short the rhetorician in general who is
in his own province the most skilful may be

but illfitted for philosophical investigation
even where there is no observation wanted 

when the facts are all ready ascertained for him
and again the ablest philosopher may make
 it is evident that the business of the advocate and that

of the judge are in this manner opposed the one being
to find arguments for the support of his clients cause the
other to ascertain the truth

and hence it is that those

who have excelled the most in the former department
sometimes manifest a deficiency in the latter though the
subjectmatter in which they are conversant remains the
saule

inference and proof



an indifferent disputant especially since the
arguments which have led him to the conclu
sion and have with him the most weight
may not perhaps be the most powerful in
controversy the commonest fault however

by far is to forget the philosopher or theolo
gian and to assume the advocate improperly
it is therefore of great use to dwell on the
distinction between these two branches

as

for the bare process of reasoning that is the
same in both cases but the preparatory pro
cesses which are requisite in order to employ
reasoning profitably these we see branch off
into two distinct channels in each of these
undoubtedly useful rules may be laid down
but they should not be confounded together
bacon has chosen the department of philoso √¢∫
phy giving rules in his organon not only for
the conduct of experiments to ascertain new
facts but also for the selection and combina
tion of known facts and principles with a view
of obtaining valuable inferences and it is pro
bable that a system of such rules is what some

writers mean if they have any distinct mean
ing by their proposed √¢Äúlogic√¢Äù
in the other department precepts have been inquiry
rhetorical

given by aristotle and other rhetorical wri
ters as a part of their plan

how far these

precepts are to be considered as belonging to
the present systemwhether √¢Äúmethod is to



on the province of reasoning

be regarded as a part of logicwhether the
matter of logic is to be included in the sys
temwhether bacons is properly to be
reckoned a kind of logic√¢Äîall these are
merely verbal questions relating to the exten
sion not of the science but of the name the

bare process of reasoning i e deducing a
conclusion from premises must ever remain a

distinct operation from the assumption of pre

mises however useful the rules maybe that have
been given or may be given for conducting this
latter process and others connected with it

and however properly such rules may be sub
joined to the precepts of that system to which
the name of logic is applied in the narrowest

sense such rules as i now allude to may be
of eminent service but they must always be
as i have before observed comparatively vague
and general and incapable of being built up
into a regular demonstrative theory like that of

the syllogism to which theory they bear much
the same relation as the principles and rules of
poetical and rhetorical criticism to those of

grammar or those of practical mechanics to

strict geometry i find no fault with the ex
tension of a term but i would suggest a cau
tion against confounding together by means of
a common name things essentially different

and above all i would deprecate the sophistry
of striving to depreciate what is called √¢Äúthe

inference and proof



school logic√¢Äù by perpetually contrasting it
with systems with which it has nothing in
common but the name and whose object is
essentially different
√¢ß 
it is not a little remarkable that writers 
anon and
bacons

whose expressions tend to confound together
by means of a common name two branches of
study which have nothing else in common as

if they were two different plans for attaining
one and the same object have themselves com

plained of one of the effects of this confusion
viz the introduction early in the career of

academical education of a course of logic
under which name they observe √¢Äúmen now
universally comprehend the works of locke
bacon c√¢Äù which as is justly remarked are

unfit for beginners now this would not have
happened if men had always kept in mind the
meaning or meanings of each name they used

and it may be added that however justly the
word logic may be thus extended we have no
ground for applying to the aristotelian logic

the remarks above quoted respecting the ba
conian which the ambiguity of the word if
not carefully kept in view might lead us to do
grant that bacons work is a

part of logic it

no more follows from the unfitness of that for

learners that the elements of the theory of



on the province of reasoning

reasoning should be withheld from them
than it follows that the elements of euclid
and common arithmetic are unfit for boys
because newtons principia which also bears
the title of mathematical is above their grasp
of two branches of study which bear the same
name or even of two parts of the same
branch the one may be suitable to the com
mencement the other to the close of the aca
demical career

at whatever period of that career it may be
proper to introduce the study of such as are
usually called metaphysical writers it may be
safely asserted that those who have had the
most experience in the business of giving in
struction in logic properly so called together
with other branches of knowledge prefer and

generally pursue the plan of letting their pupils
enter on that study next in order after the cle
ments of mathematics



chapter iv

of verbal and real questions

√¢ß l

the ingenious author of the philosophy of
rhetoric having maintained or rather assumed
that logic is applicable to verbal controversy
alone there may be an advantage though it
has been my aim throughout to show the ap
plication of it to all reasoning in pointing
out the difference between verbal and real

questions and the probable origin of camp
bells mistake for to trace any error to its
source will often throw more light on the sub
ject in hand than can be obtained if we rest
satisfied with merely detecting and refuting it
every question that can arise is in fact a

question whether a certain predicate is or is
not applicable to a certain subject or what
predicate is applicable and whatever other ac
count may be given by any writer of the nature
of any matter of doubt or debate will be
found ultimately to resolve itself into this
but sometimes the question turns on the
meaning and extent of the terms employed

sometimes on the things signified by them if
it be made to appear therefore that the oppo



on the province of reasoning

site sides of a certain question may be held by
persons not differing in their opinion of the
matter in hand then that question may be
pronounced verbal as depending on the dif
ferent senses in which they respectively employ

the terms

if on the contrary it appears that

they employ the terms in the same sense

but

still differ as to the application of one of them
to the other then it may be pronounced that

the question is real√¢Äîthat they differ as to the
opinions they hold of the things in question
if for instance two persons contend whe
ther augustus deserved to be called a √¢Äúgreat
man√¢Äù then if it appeared that the one included
under the term √¢Äúgreat√¢Äù disinterested pa
triotism and on that ground excluded augustus

from the class as wanting in that quality and
that the other also gave him no credit for that
quality but understood no more by the term

√¢Äúgreat√¢Äù than high intellectual qualities energy
of character and brilliant actions it would fol
low that the parties did not differ in opinion
except as to the use of a term and that the

question was verbal if again it appeared
that the one did give augustus credit for such
patriotism as the other deniedhim both of them

including that idea in the term great then the
question would be real either kind of
question it is plain is to be argued according
to logical principles but the middle terms

verbal and real questions



employed would be different and for this reason
among others it is important to distinguish
verbal from real controversy in the former

case e g it might be urged with truth that
the common use of the expression √¢Äúgreat and
good√¢Äù proves that the idea of good is not im

plied in the ordinary sense of the word great
an argument which could have of course no

place in deciding the other question
√¢ß 

it is by no means to be supposed that all yell√¢∫ws
questions are trifling and frivolous it 
is often of the highest importance to settle
correctly the meaning of a word either accord
ing to ordinary use or according to the mean
ing of any particular writer or class of men
but when verbal questions are mistaken for
verbal

real much confusion of thought and unpro

fitable wrangling will be generally the result
nor is it always so easy and simple a task as
might at first sight appear to distinguish them
from each other for several objects to which
one common name is applied will often have
many points of difference and yet that name
may perhaps be applied to them all in the same

sense and may be fairly regarded as the genus
they come under if it appear that they all

agree in what is designated by that name and
that the differences between them are in points



on the province of reasoning

not essential to the character of the genus a

cow and a horse differ in many respects but
agree in all that is implied by the term √¢Äúqua
druped√¢Äù which is therefore applicable to both
in the same sense

so also the houses of the

ancients differed in many respects from ours
and their ships still more yet no one would
contend that the terms √¢Äúhouse√¢Äù and √¢Äúship√¢Äù as

applied to both were ambiguous or that ofor
might not fairly be rendered house and yaws
ship because the essential characteristic of a
house is not its being of this or that form or
materials but its being a dwelling for men
these therefore would be called two different
kinds of houses and consequently the term

√¢Äúhouse√¢Äù would be applied to each without any
equivocation in the same sense and so in the
other instances

on the other hand two or

more things may bear the same name and may
also have a resemblance in many points and
may from that resemblance have come to bear
the same name and yet if the circumstance
which is essential to each be wanting in the
other the term may be pronounced ambiguous
eg the word √¢Äúpriest√¢Äù is applied to the mi
nisters of the jewish and of the pagan reli

gions and also to those of the christian and
doubtless the term is so used in consequence of

their being both ministers in some sort of
religion

nor would every difference that

verbal and real questions



might be found between the priests of differ

ent religions constitute the term ambiguous
provided such differences were nonessential

to the idea suggested by the word priest as
eg the jewish priest served the true god

and the pagan false gods this is a most im
portant difference but does not constitute the
term ambiguous because neither of these cir

cumstances is implied and suggested by the
term √¢Äòips√¢∫s which accordingly was applied

both to jewish and pagan priests but the
term √¢Äòisps√£®s does seem to have implied the office
of offering sacrifice atoning for the sins of the
people and acting as mediator between man
and the object of his worship and accordingly
that term is never applied to any one under
the christian system except to the one great
mediator

the christian ministers not hav

ing that office which was implied as essential
in the term √¢Äòisp√¢∫s were never called by that
it may be
concluded therefore that the term priest is
ambiguous as corresponding to the terms
name but by that of √¢∫peng√•ër√¢∫pos√¢Äù

√¢Äòisg√¢∫s and rpgcgirepos respectively notwithstand
ing that there are points in which these two
agree these therefore should be reckoned
not two different kinds of priests but priests in
 from which our word priest is derived but which it

is remarkable is never translated √¢Äúpriest√¢Äù in our version
of the scriptures but √¢Äúelder√¢Äù
s



on the province of reasoning

two different senses since to adopt the
phraseology of aristotle the definition of
them so far forth as they are priests would
be different

it is evidently of much importance to keep
in mind the above distinctions in order to

avoid on the one hand stigmatizing as verbal
controversies what in reality are not such
merely because the question turns on the ap
plicability of a certain predicate to a certain
subject or on the other hand falling into the

opposite error of mistaking words for things
and judging of mens agreement or disagree
ment in opinion in every case merely from

their agreement or disagreement in the terms
employed



chapter w

of realism

√¢ß 
nothing has a greater tendency to lead to the
mistake just noticed and thus to produce un

detected verbal questions and fruitless logo
machy than the prevalence of the notion of
the realists√¢Äù that genus and species are some
real things existing independently of our
conceptions and expressions and that as in

the case of singular terms there is some real
individual corresponding to each so in com
mon terms also there is something corre

sponding to each which is the object of our
thoughts when we employ any such termi
 it is well known what a long and furious controversy
long existed in all the universities of europe between the
sects of the realists and the nominalists the heat of which

on the province of reasoning

there is one circumstance which ought to

be noticed as having probably contributed not
technical
sense of spe
cies when

applied to
organized

beings

a little to foster this error i mean the pecu
liar technical sense of the word √¢Äúspecies√¢Äù
when applied to organized beings it has been
laid down in the course of this work that when
several individuals are observed to resemble

each other in some point a common name may
be assigned to them denoting that point ap
plying to all or any of them so far forth as
respects that common attribute and distin

guishing them from all others as eg the se
veral individual buildings which however dif
ferent in other respects agree in being con

structed for mens dwelling are called by the
common name of √¢Äú house√¢Äù and it was added
that as we select at pleasure the circumstance
that we choose to abstract we may thus refer

the same individual to several different species
according as it suits our purpose and the same
in respect of the reference of species to genus
whence it seems plainly to follow that genus

and species are no real things existing inde
pendent of our thoughts but are creatures of

our own minds yet in the case of species of
organized beings it seems at first sight as if

realism

this rule did not hold good but that the spe
cies to which each individual belongs could not

be in any degree arbitrarily fixed by us but
must be something real unalterable and inde
pendent of our thoughts caesar or socrates
for instance it may be said must belong to the
species man and can belong to no other
and the like with any individual brute or
plant on the other hand if any one utters

such a proposition as √¢Äúargus was a mastiff√¢Äù
to what head of predicables would this predi

cate be referred surely our logical principles
would lead us to answer that it is the species

since it could hardly be called an accident
and is manifestly no other predicable but
every naturalist would at once pronounce that
mastiff is no distinct species but only a variety
of the species dog this however does not

satisfy our inquiry as to the head of predica
bles to which it is to be referred

the solu

tion of the difficulty is to be found in the con
sideration of the peculiar technical sense of the
word √¢Äúspecies√¢Äù when applied to organized
beings in which case it is always applied √££√¢∫

when we are speaking strictly as naturalists
to such individuals as are supposed to be
descended from a common stock or which might
have so descended viz which resemble one

another to use m cuviers expression as
much as those of the same stock do

now



on the province of reasoning

this being a point on which all not merely
naturalists are agreed and since it is a matter
qu√¢∫tions of of fact that such and such individuals are or
fact and

√¢∫f are
not thus
connected
it follows
thatanimal
every
question
whether
a certain
individual

arrangeinent
angement

or plant belongs to a certain species or not is

a question not of mere arrangement but of fact
but in the case of questions respecting genus
it is otherwise if eg two naturalists dif
fered in the one placing as linnaeus all the

species of bee under one genus which the
other subdivided as later writers have done

into several genera it would be evident that
there was no question of fact debated between
them and that it was only to be considered
which was the more convenient arrangement if
on the other hand it were disputed whether
the african and the asiatic elephant are dis

tinct species or merely varieties it would be
equally manifest that the question is one of
fact since both would allow that if they were
descended or might have descended from the
same stock they were of the same species
and if otherwise of two this is the fact which

they endeavour to ascertain by such indica
tions as are to be found

for it is to be fur

ther observed that this fact being one which
cannot be directly known the consequence is
that the marks by which any species of animal
or plant is known are not the very differentia



realism

which constitutes that species now in the m√¢∫y
wni



not
case of unorganized beings these two coincide known
i
always the
the marks by which a diamond eg is distinirientia

guished from other minerals being the very
differentia that constitutes the species dia
mond

and the same is the case in the ge

mera of organized beings likewise the lin
naean genus √¢Äúfelis√¢Äù eg when considered as

a species is distinguished from others under
the same order by those very marks which
constitute its differentia

but in the infimae

species according to the view of a naturalist
of plants and animals this as has been said
is not the case since here the differentia

which constitutes each species includes in it a
circumstance which cannot be directly ascer
tained viz the being sprung from the same
stock but which we conjecture from circum

stances of resemblance so that the marks by
which a species is known are not in truth the
whole of the differentia itself but indications
of the existence of that differentia viz indi
cations of descent from a common stock

 there are a few and but a few other species to which
the same observations will in a great degree apply i mean
in which the differentia which constitutes the species and
the mark by which the species is known are not the same
eg √¢Äúmurder√¢Äù the differentia of which is that it be com
mitted √¢Äúwith malice aforethought this cannot be directly
ascertained and therefore we distinguish a murder from

any other homicide by circumstances of preparation c



on the province of reasoning

hence it is that species in the case of or
ganized beings appears to be something real
and independent of our thoughts and language
and hence naturally enough the same notions
have been often extended to the genera also

and to species of other things so that men
have an idea of each individual ofevery descrip
tion truly belonging to some one species and
no other and each species in like manner to
some one genus whether we happen to be
right or not in the ones to which we refer
them



few if any indeed in the present day avow
and maintain this doctrine but those who are

not especially on their guard are perpetually
sliding into it unawares
nothing so much conduces to this as the
transferred and secondary use of the words
ambiguity of √¢Äú same√¢Äù √¢Äúone and the same√¢Äù √¢Äúidentical√¢Äù c

the words
√¢Äúsame√¢Äù
√¢Äúone√¢Äù c

when it is not clearly perceived and carefully
borne in mind that they are employed in a
secondary sense and that more frequently

even than in the primary
suppose eg a thousand persons are think

ing of the sun it is evident it is one and the
same individual object on which all these minds
are employed so far all is clear but suppose
which are not in reality the differentia but indications of
the differentia i e grounds for concluding that the ma
lice did exist

realism



all these persons are thinking of a triangle√¢Äî
not any individual triangle but triangle in
general√¢Äîand considering perhaps the equal
ity of its angles to two right angles it would
seem as if in this case also their minds were

all employed on √¢Äúone and the same√¢Äù object
and this object of their thoughts it may be
said cannot be the mere word triangle but that
which is meant by it nor again can it be

everything that the word will apply to for
they are not thinking of triangles but of one
thing those who do not acknowledge that
this √¢Äúone thing has an existence independent
of the human mind are in general content to

tell us by way of explanation that the object of
their thoughts is the abstract √¢Äúidea√¢Äù of a tri
angle an explanation which satisfies or at

least silences many though it may be doubted
whether they very clearly understand what
sort of a thing an √¢Äúidea is which may thus
exist in a thousand different minds at once and
yet be √¢Äúone and the same√¢Äù
the fact is that √¢Äúunity√¢Äù and √¢Äúsameness√¢Äù
are in such cases employed not in the primary
sense but to denote perfect similarity when

we say that ten thousand different persons have
all √¢Äúone and the same idea in their minds or
 conceptualists is a name sometimes applied to those
who adopt this explanation to which class locke is re
ferred



on the province of reasoning

are all of √¢Äúone and the same opinion we

mean no more than that they are all think
ing exactly alike when we say that they are
all in the √¢Äúsame√¢Äù posture we mean that they

are all placed alike and so also they are said
all to have the √¢Äúsame√¢Äù disease when they are
all diseased alike
 one instance of the confusion of thought and endless

logomachy which may spring from inattention to this ambi
guity of the words √¢Äúsame√¢Äù c is afforded by the contro
versy arising out of a sermon of dr king archbishop of
dublin published about a century ago he remarked
without expressing himself perhaps with so much guarded
precision as the vehemence of his opponents rendered need
ful that √¢Äúthe attributes of the deity vizwisdom justice
c are not to be regarded as the same with those human
qualities which bear the same names but are called so by

resemblance and analogy only√¢Äù for this he was decried by
bishop berkeley and a host of other objectors down to the
present time as an atheist or little better if the divine
attributes they urged are not precisely the same in kind
though superior in degree with the human qualities which
bear the same name we cannot imitate the deity as the
scriptures require√¢Äîwe cannot know on what principles
we shall be judged√¢Äî we cannot be sure that god exists at

all with a great deal more to the same purpose all of
which would have been perceived to be entirely needless
had the authors but recollected to ascertain the meaning of
the principal word employed st when any two persons
or other objects are said to have the √¢Äúsame√¢Äù quality ac
cident c what we predicate of them is evidently a cer
tain resemblance and nothing else one man eg does
not feel anothers sickness but they are said to have the
√¢Äúsame√¢Äù disease if they are precisely similar in respect of
their ailments and so also they are said to have the same
complexion if the hue and texture of their skins be alike

dly such qualities as are entirely relative which consist

origin of the
the origin of this secondary sense of the ambiguity
of
√¢Äúsame√¢Äù c
words √¢Äú same√¢Äù √¢Äúone√¢Äù √¢Äúidentical√¢Äù c an
attention to which would clear away an incal

culable mass of confused reasoning and logo
machy is easily to be traced to the use of

language and of other signs for the purpose
in the relation borne by the subject to certain other things
√¢Äîin these it is manifest the only resemblance that can
exist is resemblance of relations i e analogy

courage eg consists in the relation in which one stands
√£© tig exei tws pos arist towards dangers tempe
rance or intemperance towards bodily pleasures c when
it is said therefore of two courageous men that they have
both the same quality the only meaning this expression can

have is that they are so far completely analogous in their
characters having similar ratios to certain similar ob

jects in short as in all qualities sameness can mean
only strict resemblance so in those which are of a relative
nature resemblance can mean only analogy

thus it ap

pears that what dr king has been so vehemently censured
for asserting respecting the deity is literally true even with
respect to men themselves viz that it is only by analogy
that two persons can be said to possess the same virtue or
other such quality dly but what he means is plainly that
this analogy is far less eract and complete in the case of a
comparison between the deity and his creatures than be
tween one man and another which surely no one would
venture to deny but the doctrine against which the
attacks have been directed is selfevident the moment we

consider the meaning of the term employed
in the introduction and notes to the last edition of arch

bishop kings discourse i have considered the matters in
debate more fully but this slight notice of them has been
introduced in this place as closely connected with the pre
sent subject



on the province of reasoning

of mutual communication

if any one utters

the √¢Äúone single√¢Äù word √¢Äútriangle√¢Äù and gives
√¢Äúone single definition of it each of the per
sons who hear him forms a certain notion in

his own mind not differing in any respect from
that of each of the rest they are said there
fore to have all √¢Äúone and the same√¢Äù notion

because resulting from and corresponding
with that which is in the primary sense
√¢Äúone and the same√¢Äù expression and there is
said to be √¢Äúone single√¢Äù idea of every triangle
considered merely as a triangle because one
single name or definition is equally applicable
to each

in like manner all the coins struck

by the same single die are said to have √¢Äúone
and the same√¢Äù impression merely because
the one description which suits one of these
coins will equally suit any other that is exactly
like it

it is not intended to recommend the disuse

of the words √¢Äú same√¢Äù √¢Äúidentical√¢Äù c in this
transferred sense which if it were desirable
would be utterly impracticable but merely a
steady attention to the ambiguity thus intro
duced and watchfulness against the errors

thence arising the difficulties and perplex
ities which have involved the questions re
specting personal identity among others may

be traced principally to the neglect of this

realism

caution



put a full consideration of that

question would be unsuitable to the subject of
this work

 i mean that many writers have sought an explanation
of the primary sense of identity viz personal by looking
to the secondary any grown man eg is in the primary
sense the same person he was when a child this same

ness is i conceive a simple motion which it is vain to
attempt explaining by any other more simple but when
philosophers seek to gain a clearer notion of it by looking
to the cases in which sameness is predicated in another
sense viz similarity such as exists between several indivi

duals denoted by a common name as when we say that
there are growing on lebanon some of the same trees with
which the temple was built meaning cedars of that species
this is surely as idle as if we were to attempt explaining the
primary sense e g of √¢Äúrage√¢Äù as it exists in the human
mind by directing our attention to the √¢Äúrage√¢Äù of the sea

whatever personal identity does consist in it is plain that
it has nothing to do with similarity since every one would
be ready to say √¢Äúwhen i was a child i thought as a
child√¢Äîi spake as a child√¢Äîi understood as a child but
when i became a man i put away childish things√¢Äù

on certain terms which are
be

peculiarly liable to

used ambiguously

it has appeared to me desirable to illustrate the import
ance of attending to the ambiguity of terms by a greater
number of instances than could have been conveniently
either inserted in the context or introduced in a note with
out too much interrupting the course of the discussion of
fallacies



the words and phrases which may be employed as am
biguous middle terms are of course innumerable but it
may be in several respects of service to the learner to ex
plain the ambiguity of a few of those most frequently oc
curring in the most important discussions and whose
double meaning has been the most frequently overlooked
and this not by entering into an examination of all the
senses in which each term is ever employed but of those

only which are the most liable to be confounded together
it is worth observing that the words whose ambiguity

is the most frequently overlooked and is productive of the
greatest amount of confusion of thought and fallacy are
among the commonest and are those of whose meaning the
generality consider there is the least room to doubt it is
t





appendix

indeed from these very circumstances that the danger
arises words in very common use are both the most liable
from the looseness of ordinary

discourse to slide from one

sense into another and also the least likely to have that
ambiguity suspected familiar acquaintance is perpe
tually mistaken for accurate knowledge


argument in the strict logical sense has been de
fined in the foregoing treatise compendium part iii
√¢ß in that sense it includes as is there remarked the
conclusion as well as the

premises and thus it is that

we say a syllogism consists of three propositions viz the

conclusion which is proved as well as those by which it
is proved

but in ordinary discourse argument is very often used
for the premises alone in contradistinction to the conclu

sion eg √¢Äúthe conclusion which this argument is in
tended to establish is so and so√¢Äù

it is also sometimes employed to denote what is strictly

speaking a course or series of such arguments when a
certain conclusion is established by premises which are
themselves in the same dissertation proved by other pro

positions and perhaps those again by others the whole of
this dissertation is often called an argument to prove the
ultimate conclusion designed to be established though in
fact it is a train of arguments it is in this sense eg
that we speak of √¢Äúwarburtons argument to prove the
divine legation of moses√¢Äù c

sometimes also the word is used to denote what may be
properly called a disputation i e two trains of argu

ment opposed to each other as when we say that a and
b had a long argument on such and such a subject and
that a had the best of the argument doubtless the use
of the word in this sense has contributed to foster the

ambiguous terms



motion entertained by many that logic is the √¢Äúart of
wrangling√¢Äù that it makes men contentious c they have
heard that it is employed about arguments and hastily
conclude that it is confined to cases where there is oppo
sition and contest

it may be worth mentioning in this place that the various
jorms of stating an argument are sometimes spoken of as
different kinds of argument as when we speak of a ca
tegorical or hypothetical argument or of one in the first
or some other figure though every logician knows that

the same individual argument may be stated in various
figures c
this no doubt has contributed to the error of those who

speak of the syllogism as a peculiar kind of argument

and of √¢Äúsyllogistic reasoning√¢Äù as a distinct mode of
reasoning instead of being only a certain form of express

casesometimes grammarians use this word to sig
nify which is its strict sense a certain √¢Äúvariation in the
writing and utterance of a noun denoting the relation in
which it stands to some other part of the sentence√¢Äù some
times to denote that relation itself whether indicated by

the termination or by a preposition or by its collocation
and there is hardly any writer on the subject who does
not occasionally employ the term in each sense without
explaining the ambiguity much confusion and frivolous
debate has hence resulted whoever would see a specimen

of this may find it in the port royal greek grammar in
t 



appendix

which the authors insist on giving the greek language an
ablative case with the same termination however as the

dative though by the way they had better have fixed
on the genitive which oftener answers to the latin abla

tive urging and with great truth that if a distinct ter

mination be necessary to constitute a case many latin
nouns will be without an ablative some without a geni
tive or without a dative and all neuters without an ac

cusative

and they add that since it is possible in every

instance to render into greek the latin ablative conse

quently there must be an ablative in greek if they had
known and recollected that in the language of lapland
there are as we are told thirteen cases they would have
hesitated to use an argument which would prove that
there must therefore be thirteen cases in greek and latin

also 

all this confusion might have been avoided if it

had but been observed that the word √¢Äúcase√¢Äù is used in
two senses

cause√¢Äîsee √¢Äú reason√¢Äù and √¢Äú why√¢Äù

certain√¢Äîthis is a word whose ambiguity toge
ther with that of many others of kindred signification as
√¢Äúmay√¢Äù √¢Äúcan√¢Äù √¢Äúmust√¢Äù √¢Äúpossible√¢Äù c has occasioned
infinite perplexity in discussions on some of the most im
portant subjects such as the freedom of human actions
the divine foreknowledge c

in its primary sense it is applied according to its ety
mology from cerno to the state of a persons mind de

noting any ones full and complete conviction and gene
rally though not always implying that there is sufficient
ground for such conviction it was thence easily trans
ferred to the truths or events respecting which this convic
tion is rationally entertained and uncertain as well as

ambiguous terms



the substantives and adverbs derived from these adjectives
follows the same rule thus we say √¢Äúit is certain that a
battle has been fought√¢Äù √¢Äúit is certain that the moon will
be full on such a day√¢Äù √¢Äúit is uncertain whether such a
one is alive or dead√¢Äù √¢Äúit is uncertain whether it will rain

tomorrow√¢Äù meaning in these and in all other cases that
we are certain or uncertain respectively not indicating
any difference in the character of the events themselves
except in reference to our knowledge respecting them

for the same thing may be at the same time both certain
and uncertain to different individuals eg the life or
death at a particular time of any one is certain to his
friends on the spot uncertain or contingent to those at a
distance from not attending to this circumstance the

words √¢Äúuncertain√¢Äù and √¢Äúcontingent√¢Äù which is employed
nearly in the same sense as uncertain in its secondary
meaning have been considered by many writers as de
noting some quality in the things themselves and have thus
become involved in endless confusion √¢Äúcontingent√¢Äù is
indeed applied to events only not to persons but it de
notes no quality in the events themselves only as has
been said the relation in which they stand to a person who
has no complete knowledge respecting them it is from
overlooking this principle obvious as it is when once dis
tinctly stated that chance or fortune has come to be re
 among others archbishop king in his discourse on
predestination has fallen into this error as is explained in the

notes and the appendix to my edition of that work
it may be allowable to mention in this place that i have been
represented as coinciding with him as to the point in ques
tion in a note to mr davisons work on prophecy through a

mistake which the author candidly acknowledged and has pro
mised to rectify

church is sometimes employed to signify the church

sometimes again it is employed to signify a

which sense we read of the √¢Äúseven churches in asiaof

this ambiguity has often greatly favoured the cause of the

experience√¢Äîthis word in its strict sense applies
to events which have taken place within a persons own

knowledge experience in this sense of course relates to
the past alone thus it is that a man knows by experi
ence what sufferings he has undergone in some disease or

what height the tide reached at a certain time and place

ambiguous terms



more frequently the word is used to denote that judg
ment which is derived from experience in the primary
sense by reasoning from that in combination with other

data thus a man may assert on the ground of expe
rience that he was cured of a disorder by such a medi
cine√¢Äîthat that medicine is generally beneficial in that
disorderthat the tide may always be expected under
such circumstances to rise to such a height strictly
speaking none of these can be known by experience but
are conclusions derived from experience it is in this
sense only that experience can be applied to the future or
which comes to the same thing to any general fact as
eg when it is said that we know by experience that
water exposed to a certain temperature will freeze
there are again two different applications of the word
see ch iii s which when not carefully distinguished
lead in practice to the same confusion as the employment
of it in two senses viz we sometimes understand ourown

personal experience sometimes general experience
hume has availed himself of this practical ambiguity in
his essay on miracles in which he observes that we have

experience of the frequent falsity of testimony but that
the occurrence of a miracle is contrary to our expe
rience and is consequently what no testimony ought to
be allowed to establish now had he explained whose
experience he meant the argument would have come to
nothing if he means the experience of mankind univer
sally i e that a miracle has never come under the expe
rience of any one this is palpably begging the question
if he means the experience of each individual who has
never himself witnessed a miracle this would establish a

rule viz that we are to believe nothing of which we have
not ourselves experienced the like which it would argue

insanity to act upon not only was the king of bantam

justified as hume himself admits in listening to no evi
dence for the existence of ice but no one would be autho

zized on this principle to expect his own death

his ex

perience informs him directly only that others have died
every disease under which he himself may have laboured
his experience must have told him has not terminated fa

tally if he is to judge strictly of the future by the past
according to this rule what should hinder him from expect

ing the like of all future diseases probably he meant if
indeed he had any distinct meaning something intermediate
between these two viz the experience of the generality
as to what is common and of ordinary occurrence in which
sense the maxim will only amount to this that false tes
timony is a thing of common occurrence and that miracles
are not an obvious truth no doubt but too general to

authorize of itself a conclusion in any particular case in
any other individual question as to the admissibility of
evidence it would be reckoned absurd to consider merely
the average chances for the truth of testimony in the ab
stract without inquiring what the testimony is in the par
ticular instance before us

it is to be observed by the way that there is yet an ad
ditional ambiguity in the entire phrase √¢Äúcontrary to ex
perience√¢Äù in one sense a miracle or any other event
may be called contrary to the experience of any one who

has never witnessed the like as the freezing of water was
o that of the king of bantam in another and stricter sense
that only is contrary to a mans experience which he knows

by experience not to be true asif one should be told of an
infallible remedy for some disorder he having seen it ad

ministered without effect no testimony can establish
what is in this latter sense contrary to experience we

need not wonder that ordinary minds should be bewildered
by a sophistical employment of such a mass of ambiguities

such reasonings as these are accounted ingenious and
profound on account of the subject on which they are
employed if applied to the ordinary affairs of life they
would be deemed unworthy of serious notice
falsehood and falsity√¢Äîsee √¢Äútruth√¢Äù
gospel

this is instanced as one of the words which

is practically ambiguous from its different applications

even though not employed as it sometimes is in different
senses

conformably to its etymological meaning of √¢Äúgood
tidings√¢Äù it is used to signify and that especially and exclu
sively the welcome intelligence of salvation to man as

preached by our lord and his followers but it was
afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histo
ries of our lord√¢Äôs life published by those who are called
the evangelists this is one source of some important
theological errors many supposing that gospeltruth is
to be found exclusively or chiefly in the gospels to the
neglect of the other sacred writings again since jesus
is said to have preached the √¢Äúgospel√¢Äù and the same is
said of the apostles the conclusion is often hence drawn
that the discourses of our lord and the apostolic epistles

must exactly coincide and that in case of any apparent
difference the former must be the standard and the latter

must be taken to bear no other sense than what is implied
by the other a notion which leads inevitably and imme

diately to the neglect of the apostolic epistles when
everything they contain must be limited and modified into
a complete coincidence with our lord√¢Äôs discourses

whereas it is very conceivable that though both might be
in a certain sense √¢Äúgoodtidings√¢Äù yet one may contain
a much more full developement of the christian scheme

than the other which is confirmed by the consideration
that the principal events on which the religion is founded
the atoning sacrifice and resurrection of christ had not
taken place nor could be clearly declared by our lord

at hand√¢Äù not that it was actually established as it was

impossibility according to the definition wenay
choose to give of this word it may be said either that there
are three species of it or that it may be used in three dif
ferent senses st what may be called a mathematical
impossibility is that which involves an absurdity and self
contradiction eg that two straight lines should enclose a
space is not only impossible but inconceivable as it would
be at variance with the definition of a straight line and

it should be observed that inability to accomplish anything
which is in this sense impossible implies no limitation of
power and is compatible even with omnipotence in the
fullest sense of the word if it be proposed eg to con
struct a triangle having one of its sides equal to the other
two or to find two numbers having the same ratio to each
other as the side of a square and its diameter it is not from
a defect of power that we are precluded from solving such

a problem as these since in fact the problem is in itself
unmeaning and absurd it is in reality nothing that is
required to be done

dly what may be called a physical impossibility is
something at variance with the existing laws of nature

ambiguous terms



and which consequently no being subject to those laws
as we are can surmount but we can easily conceive a

being capable of bringing about what in the ordinary
course of nature is impossible e g to multiply five
loaves into food for a multitude or to walk on the sur

face of the waves are things physically impossible but
imply no contradiction on the contrary we cannot but
suppose that the being if there be such an one who
created the universe is able to alter at will the properties
of any of the substances it contains√¢Äù
and an occurrence of this character we call miraculous

not but that one person may perform without supernatu
ral power what is to another physically impossible as
eg a man may lift a great weight which it would be
physically impossible for a child to raise because it is
contrary to the laws of nature that a muscle of this de

gree of strength should overcome a resistance which one
of that degree is equal to but if any one perform what
is beyond the natural powers of man universally he has
performed a miracle much sophistry has been founded
on the neglect of the distinction between these two senses
it has even been contended that no evidence ought to in
duce a man of sense to admit that a miracle has taken

place on the ground that it is a thing impossible in other
words that it is a miracle for if it were not a thing im

possible to man there would be no miracle in the case
so that such an argument is palpably begging the question
but it has often probably been admitted from an indistinct
notion being suggested of impossibility in the first sense 
in which sense viz that of selfcontradiction no evidence
certainly would justify belief
 see an able disquisition on miracles subjoined to the life
of apollonius tyanaeus in the encyclopaedia metropolitana



appendix

dly moral impossibility signifies only that high degree
of improbability which leaves no room for doubt

in

this sense we often call a thing impossible which implies
no contradiction nor violation of the laws of nature
but which yet we are rationally convinced will never
occur merely from the multitude of chances againstit as
eg that unloaded dice should turn up the same faces one
hundred times successively and in this sense we cannot
accurately draw the line so as to determine at what point
the improbability amounts to an impossibility and hence
we often have occasion to speak of this or that as almost
impossible though not quite c the other impossibili
ties do not admit of degrees that a certain throw should
recur two or three times successively we should call not
very improbable the improbability is increased at each
successive step but we cannot say exactly when it be
comes impossible though no one would scruple to call
one hundred such recurrences impossible

in the same sense we often call things impossible which
are completely within the power of known agents to bring
about but which we are convinced no one of them ever

will bring about thus eg that all the civilized people
in the world should with one accord forsake their habita

tions and wander about the fields as savages every one
would call an impossibility though it is plain they have
the power to do so and that it depends on their choice
which they will do in like manner if we were told of a
mans having disgracefully fled from his post whom we
knew to be possessed of the most undaunted courage we
should without scruple and with good reason supposing
the idea formed of his character to be a just one pro
nounce this an impossibility meaning that there is suffi

cient ground for being fully convinced that the thing
could never take place not from any idea of his not

ambiguous terms



having power and liberty to fly if he would for our
certainty is built on the very circumstance of his being free
to act as he will together with his being of such a dispo
sition as never to have the will to act disgracefully if
again a man were bound hand and foot it would be in

the other sense impossible for him to fly viz out of his
power √¢Äúcapable√¢Äù has a corresponding ambiguity
the performance of anything that is morally impossible
to a mere man is to be reckoned a miracle as much as if

the impossibility were physical e g it is morally impos
sible for poor jewish fishermen to have framed such a
scheme of ethical and religious doctrine as the gospel
exhibits it is morally impossible for a man to foretell
distant and improbable future events with the exactitude
of many of the prophecies in the old testament

much of the confusion of thought which has pervaded
and has interminably protracted the discussions respect

ing the longagitated question of human freedom has
arisen from inattention to the ambiguity which has been
here noticed if the deity it is said √¢Äúforesees exactly
what i shall do on any occasion it must be impossible for
me to act otherwise√¢Äù and thence it is inferred that mans

actions cannot be free the middle term employed in
such an argument as this is √¢Äúimpossible√¢Äù or √¢Äúimpossibi

lity√¢Äù employed in two senses he to whom it is in one
sense impossible viz physically to act otherwise than
he does i e who has it not in his power is not a free

agent correct foreknowledge implies impossibility in
another sense viz moral impossibilitythe absence of
all room for doubt and the perplexity is aggravated by
resorting for the purpose of explanation to such words as

√¢Äúmay√¢Äù √¢Äúcan√¢Äù √¢Äúpossible√¢Äù √¢Äúmust√¢Äù c all of which
are affected by a corresponding ambiguity see tuckers

l

law is etymologically that which is √¢Äúlaid√¢Äù down
and is used in the most appropriate sense to signify some
general injunction command or regulation addressed to
certain persons who are called upon to conform to it it
is in this sense that we speak of √¢Äúthe law of moses√¢Äù
√¢Äú the law of the land√¢Äù c
it is also used in a transferred sense to denote the state

ment of some general fact the several individual instances
of which exhibit a conformity to that statement analogous
to the conduct of persons in respect to a law which they
obey it is in this sense that we speak of √¢Äúthe laws of
nature√¢Äù when we say that √¢Äúa seed in vegetating directs

the radicle downwards and the plumule upwards in com
pliance with a law of nature√¢Äù we only mean that such
is universally the fact and so in other cases
it is evident therefore that in this sense the conformity
of individual cases to the general rule is that which consti
tutes a law of nature

if water should henceforth never

become solid at any temperature then the freezing of
water would no longer be a law of nature whereas in
the other sense a law is not the more or the less a law

from the conformity or nonconformity of individuals to
it if an act of our legislature were to be disobeyed and
utterly disregarded by every one it would not on that
account be the less a law

this distinction may appear so obvious when plainly
stated as hardly to need mention yet writers of great
note and ability have confounded these two senses toge

cannot are each used in two senses which are very

happened we are not sure of the reverse when again
we say √¢Äúthis man of so grateful a disposition must have
eagerly embraced such an opportunity of requiting his
benefactor√¢Äù or √¢Äúone who approves of the slave trade
must be very hardhearted√¢Äù we only mean to imply the
absence of all doubt on these points the very notions of
gratitude and of hardheartedness exclude the idea of com
pulsion but when we say that √¢Äúall men must die√¢Äù or

that √¢Äúa man must go to prison who is dragged by force√¢Äù
we mean √¢Äúwhether they will or not√¢Äù√¢Äîthat there is no

the present is a remarkable instance of the influence of an
ambiguous word over the thoughts even of those who are
not ignorant of the ambiguity but are not carefully on

the watch against its effects the impressions and ideas
associated by habit with the word when used in one sense
being always apt to obtrude themselves unawares when it
is employed in another sense and thus to affect our rea
sonings e g old times√¢Äî√¢Äúthe old world√¢Äù c are ex
pressions in frequent use and which oftener than not
produce imperceptibly the associated impression of the
superior wisdom resulting from experience which as a
general rule we attribute to old men yet no one is
really ignorant that the world is older now than ever it
was and that the instruction to be derived from observa

tions on the past which is the advantage that old persons
possess must be greater supposing other things equal to
every successive generation and bacons remark to this
purpose appears as soon as distinctly stated a mere
truism yet few perhaps that he made are more import

kind of deference to the authority of √¢Äúold times√¢Äù as of

closely connected with its etymology it is well known
that the latin word persona signified originally a mask
which actors wore on the stage each of which being
painted in each instance suitably to the character to be
represented and worn by every one who acted the part the
word came to signify the character itself which the actor
played and afterwards any character proper or as
sumed which any one sustained as e g in a passage of
cicero de oratore where he is describing the process by
which he composed his pleadings by imagining himself in
the place of his opponent and of the judge as well as his
own √¢Äútres personas unus suscipio summa animi aequi

of the latin idiom lasted

persona in its classical sense

was naturally adopted by theologians to distinguish the
father the son and holy spirit in the blessed trinity

so as to imply the unity of the divine being who is all
and each of these and the word person was adopted by
our divines in the same sense as a literal or rather an

etymological translation of the latin word persona in
this sense its difference from person as commonly em
ployed is most important for it is evident that √¢Äúthree
divine persons√¢Äù in the ordinary meaning of the word is
precisely equivalent to √¢Äúthree gods√¢Äù our church
however not only maintains and inculcates the strict unity

of the supreme being but retains a creed which expressly
declares the son to be √¢Äú of one substance with the fa

ther √¢Äù though she has been charged with teaching con

tradictions while she teaches what is surely not at all
unintelligible that what is three in one sense may in
another sense be one whether it were wisely done to
introduce at all the word person in a sense different in a

most important particular from the ordinary one yet so

nearly approaching to it as to be always likely to perplex
and mislead it is now too late to inquire but it is worth
remarking that our reformers appear to have introduced

it only from a desire to render faithfully what they trans
lated seeming in most instances where they composed
anything original for the use of the people carefully to

abstain from it it does not occur in the collect though
it does in the communionpreface for trinity sunday nor
in the brief but satisfactory summary of the chief doc
trines of the apostles creed contained in the catechism

in this our church very wisely and scripturally sets
before us the relations in which the most high stands to

adhering to the apparent design of holy writ which
seems to be to reveal to us with a view to our prac
tical benefit not what god is in himself but what he is

relatively to us they were wise therefore in deciding
as they appear to have done that whatever other distinc

tions between father son and holy ghost do really
exist in the divine essence but are neither relative to us

nor connected with a christian life are at least not to be

dwelt on at any rate till we have fully embraced and
sufficiently applied those many doctrines which are in
some degree both comprehensible by the understanding
and practically useful to us so far however have many
others been from imitating this wisdom that i have even
seen a popular explanation mrs trimmers of the very
passage last alluded to in the catechism in which the
word person is introduced without even an allusion to

its being employed in a peculiar sense if it be vain to

explain the unknown by the unknown how great must be
the absurdity of explaining what in fact was already made

as simple and intelligible as possible by a word which
will not be merely notunderstood but misunderstood it
is setting the blind to lead the seeing
the consequences of this practice which unfortunately
is very common are more extensively mischievous than
most men are aware to the undetected ambiguity of the
word person may be traced a large portion of the soci
nianism arianism and infidelity that prevail it is not
wonderful that the unthinking when they have never
heard the explanation of the two senses of the word
should be persuaded to renounce a faith which is repre
sented to them for want of that explanation as involving
a contradiction or leading to tritheism and many who


do understand or at least have once understood the

ambiguity in question are apt and the same takes place

recurrence of the ordinary sense of the word to those who
are not especially on their guard against it see falla
cies ch iii √¢ß and hence the frequent use of the
word person in its ordinary sense causes them to slide in
sensibly into the unthoughtof but not uncommon heresy
of tritheism from which they think themselves the more
secure because they always maintain the unity of the
deity though they gradually come to understand that
unity in a merely figurative sense viz a unity of pur
pose and concert of action just as any one commonly

says √¢Äúmy friend suchanone and myself are one√¢Äù
meaning that they pursue the same designs with entire
mutual confidence and perfect cooperation and have that
exact agreement in opinions views tastes c which is
often denoted by the expression √¢Äúone mind√¢Äù see re

duced is indeed one which cannot be regarded as trifling in
itself if we consider that the maintenance of the doctrine of

the strict unity of god was no small part of the great pur

pose for which one nation was during so many ages separated
from all the rest of the world but the collateral effects

resulting are far more important i mean not only that

many are by this means as has been above remarked
driven into perversion of gospeltruth on the opposite side
or a total rejection of it but also that a far greater num

ber of wellintentioned christians are led to the practical
neglect of a doctrine which is the cornerstone of our

faith they find their minds so perplexed and confused by
the ordinary statements of the doctrine of the trinity and

in so much danger ofsliding into tritheism that while they
humbly give their assent to it they at the same time i say
this in a great measure not from conjecture but from
knowledge of the fact deliberately and as a point of con

science study to keep the doctrine out of their thoughts
though it ought to be the springhead of those christian
principles which are called into christian practice every
day
too often do those who can and should clear up for
them these factitious difficulties content themselves with

saying that the whole subject is mysterious and must not
be too carefully pryed into not considering the difference
between divine revelations and human expositions of them

etymologically the word answers to presbyter i e
elder of the christian church and is often applied to the
second order of christian ministers at the present day
but it is remarkable that it never occurs in this sense in

our translation of the scriptures the word √¢∫pso√§çdispos
being always rendered by elder and its derivative priest

always given as the translation of √¢Äòipses this latter is
an office assigned to none under the gospelscheme

except the one great high priest of whom the jewish
priests were types and who offered a sacrifice that

distinguishing

office of a priest in the

sense of √¢Äòispaws which is the only one under the

it is incalculable how much confusion has arisen from

confounding together the two senses of the word priest
and thence the two offices themselves

i have enlarged accordingly on this subject in a sermon
preached before the university of oxford and subjoined
to the last edition of the bampton lectures
reason√¢Äîthis word is liable to many ambiguities of
which i propose to notice only a few of the most important
sometimes it is used to signify all the intellectual powers

collectively in which sense it can hardly be said to be
altogether denied to brutes since several of what we
reckon intellectual processes in the human mind are evi

dently such as some brutes are capable of
reason is however frequently employed to denote those
intellectual powers exclusively in which man differs from
brutes though what these are no one has been able pre

ambiguous terms



cisely to define the employment at will of the faculty
of abstraction seems to be the principal that being at
least principally concerned in the use of language the
moral faculty or power of distinguishing right from
wrong appears also to be closely connected with abstrac
tion and of this brutes are destitute but then dr paley

and some other ethical writers deny it to man also the
description given by that author of our discernment of
good and bad conduct viz as wholly dependent on ex
pectation of reward and punishment would equally apply

to many of the brutecreation especially the dog it is
in this sense however that some writers speak of √¢Äúrea
son√¢Äù as enabling us to judge of virtue and vice not as
dr campbell in his philosophy of rhetoric has understood
them in the sense of the power of argumentation 
reason however is often used for the faculty of carry

ing on the third operation of the mind viz reasoning
and it is from inattention to this ambiguity which has
been repeatedly noticed in the course of the foregoing
treatise that some have treated of logic as the art of
rightly employing the mental faculties in general
reason is also employed to signify the premiss or pre
mises of an argument and it is from reason in this sense
that the word √¢Äúreasoning√¢Äù is derived
it is also very frequently used to signify a cause as
when we say in popular language that the √¢Äúreason of
an eclipse of the sun is that the moon is interposed between
it and the earth√¢Äù this should strictly be called the cause
on the other hand √¢Äúbecause√¢Äù ie by cause is used to in

troduce either the physical cause or the logical proof
and √¢Äútherefore√¢Äù √¢Äúhence√¢Äù √¢Äúsince√¢Äù √¢Äúfollow√¢Äù √¢Äúconse
quence√¢Äù and many other kindred words have a correspond

ing ambiguity eg √¢Äúthe ground is wet because it has
rained√¢Äù or √¢Äúit has rained and hence the ground is wet√¢Äù



appendix

this is the assignment of the cause again √¢Äúit has rained be
cause the ground is wet√¢Äù √¢Äúthe ground is wet and therefore
it has rained√¢Äù this is assigning the logical proof the wetness
of the ground is the cause not of the rain having fallen
but of our knowing that it has fallen and this probably
it is that has led to the ambiguous use in all languages of
almost all the words relating to these two points it is an

ambiguity which has produced incalculable confusion of
thought and from which it is the harder to escape on ac
count of its extending to those very forms of expression
which are introduced in order to clear it up
what adds to the confusion is that the cause is often
employed as a proof of the effect as when we infer from
a great fall of rain that there is or will be a flood which

is at once the physical effect and the logical conclusion
the case is just reversed when from a flood we infer that
the rain has fallen

the more attention any one bestows on this ambiguity
the more extensive and important its results will appear

regeneration√¢Äîthis word is employed by some
divines to signify the new life and character which ought
to distinguish a christian by others more correctly the
first entrance on or beginning of such a state and these

of course are as different things as a fullgrown branch
from a bud

much controversy has taken place as to the time at
which and the circumstances under which √¢Äú regenera

tion√¢Äù takes place the greater part of which may be traced
to this ambiguity
same as well as √¢Äúone√¢Äù√¢Äúidentical√¢Äù and other words

derived from them is used frequently in a sense very

ambiguous terms



different from its primary one as applicable to a single
object being employed to denote great similarity when
several objects are undistinguishably alike one single de
scription will apply equally to any of them and thence

they are said to be all of one and the same nature appear
ance c as eg when we say √¢Äúthis house is built of the
same stone with such another√¢Äù we only mean that the
stones are undistinguishable in their qualities not that
the one building was pulled down and the other con

structed with the materials whereas sameness in the
primary sense does not even necessarily imply similarity
for if we say of any man that he is greatly altered since

such a time we understand and indeed imply by the very
expression that he is one person though different in
several qualities it is worth observing also that same
in the secondary sense admits according to popular
usage of degrees we speak of two things being nearly the
same but not entirely personal identity does not admit
of degrees nothing perhaps has contributed more to

the error of realism than inattention to this ambiguity
when several persons are said to have one and the same

opinion thought or idea men overlooking the true
simple statement of the case which is that they are all
thinking alike look for something more abstruse and mys

truth of what i say shall be proved√¢Äù the term is here
used in these two senses

in like manner falsehood is

often opposed to truth in both these senses being com
monly used to signify the quality of a false proposition
but as we have the word falsity which properly denotes
this i have thought it best in a scientific treatise always
to employ it for that purpose
in its etymological sense truth signifies that which the

nected together in their significations and as the explana
tions of their ambiguities have been furnished by the
kindness of the professor of political economy it seemed
advisable to place them by themselves and in the order
in which they appeared to him most naturally to arrange
themselves

the foundations of political economy being a few gene
ral propositions deduced from observation or from con
sciousness and generally admitted as soon as stated it
might have been expected that there would be as little
difference of opinion among politicaleconomists as among
mathematicians√¢Äîthat being agreed in their premises
they could not differ in their conclusions but through some
error in reasoning so palpable as to be readily detected
and if they had possessed a vocabulary of general terms

as precisely defined as the mathematical this would proba
bly have been the case

but as the terms of this science

are drawn from common discourse and seldom care

fully defined by the writers who employ them hardly one
of them has any settled and invariable meaning and
their ambiguities are perpetually overlooked the prin
cipal terms are only seven viz value wealth la
bour capital rent wages pr of its
 walue as value is the only relation with which
political economy is conversant we might expect all
economists to be agreed as to its meaning there is no
subject as to which they are less agreed

the popular and far the most convenient use of the
word is to signify the capacity of being given and received
in exchange so defined it expresses a relation the

value of any one thing must consist in the several quanti



appendix

ties of all other things which can be obtained in exchange
for it and can never remain fixed for an instant

most

writers admit the propriety of this definition at the outset
but they scarcely ever adhere to it
adam smith defines value to mean either the utility of
a particular object or the power of purchasing other
goods which the possession of that object conveys the
first he calls √¢Äúvalue in use√¢Äù the second √¢Äúvalue in ex
change√¢Äù but he soon afterwards says that equal quanti
ties of labour at all times and places are of equal value to
the labourer whatever may be the quantity of goods he
receives in return for them and that labour never varies

in its own value it is clear that he affixed or thought he
had affixed some other meaning to the word as the first
of these propositions is contradictory and the second false
whichever of his two definitions we adopt
mr ricardo appears to set out by admitting adam
smiths definition of value in exchange but in the
greater part of his √¢Äúprinciples of political economy√¢Äù

he uses the word as synonymous with cost and by this
one ambiguity has rendered his great work a long enigma
mr malthus√¢Äù defines value to be the power of purcha
sing in the very next page he distinguishes absolute
from relative value a distinction contradictory to his
definition of the term as expressive of a relation
mr mculloch√•ø distinguishes between real and ex
changeable or relative value and in his nomenclature

all these differences appear to arise from a confusion of
cause and effect having decided that commodities are
valuable in proportion to the labour they have respectively

mr malthus √¢Äú those

adam smith confines the term to that portion of the re

land mr mcullochi and m storch to those mate

rial products which have exchangeable value according
to colonel torrens it consists of articles which possess

utility and are produced by some portion of voluntary
effort m say divides wealth into natural and social
and applies the latter term to whatever is susceptible of
exchange it will be observed that the principal difference
between these definitions consists in the admission or

rejection of the qualifications √¢Äúexchangeable and material√¢Äù

it were well if the ambiguities of this word had done
no more than puzzle philosophers

one of them gave

birth to the mercantile system in common language to
grow rich is to get money to diminish in fortune is to lose

a poor man very little and the terms wealth and money

are in short employed as synonymous in consequence

 labour the word labour signifies both the act
of labouring and the result of that act

it is used in the

first sense when we talk of the wages of labour in the
second when we talk of accumulated labour

when used

to express the act of labouring it may appear to have a

precise sense but it is still subject to some ambiguity

ambiguous terms



says definition is √¢Äúaction suivie dirig√£©e vers unb√£ºt√¢Äù
storchst √¢Äú laction des facult√£©s humaines dirig√£©e vers un
b√£ºt utile√¢Äù

these definitions include a walk taken for the

purposes of health and even the exertions of an agreeable
converser

the great defect of adam smith and of our own eco

nomists in general is the want of definitions there is
perhaps no definition of labour by any british econo
mist if adam smith had framed one he would probably
have struck out his celebrated distinction between √¢Äúpro
ductive√¢Äù and √¢Äúunproductive√¢Äù labourers for it is difficult

to conceive any definition of labour which will admit the
epithet √¢Äúunproductive√¢Äù to be applied to any of its sub
divisions excepting that of misdirected labour on the
other hand if mr mculloch or mr mill had defined

labour they would scarcely have applied that term to the
growth of a tree or the improvement of wine in a cellar
 capital this word as might have been expected
from the complexity of the notions which it implies has
been used in very different senses
it is as usual undefined by adam smith the general
meaning which he attached to it will however appear from

his enumeration of its species he divides it√•ø into fired
and circulating including in the first what the capitalist
retains in the second what he parts with fixed capital

it is obvious that few of these definitions exactly coin


cide

adam smiths excludes the necessaries of the

labourer when in his own possession all the rest and
perhaps with better reason admit them on the other
hand adam smith admits and in that he seems to be
right those things which are incapable of productive con
sumption provided they have not yet reached their con
sumers all the other definitions except perhaps that of

mr malthus which is ambiguous are subject to the incon
sistency of affirming that a diamond and the gold in which
it is to be set are capital while the jeweller keeps them se

parate but cease to be so when he has formed them into a
ring almost all of them also pointedly exclude knowledge
and skill the most objectionable perhaps is that of
mr mculloch which while it excludes all the finished

contents of a jewellers shop would include a racing
stud

adam smith however is far from being consistent in
his use of the word thus in the beginning of his second

book he states that all capitals are destined for the main
tenance of productive labour only it is difficult to see

what labour is maintained by what is to be unproductively
consumed

 rent

 wages

 profit

adam smith first divided revenue into rent wages

and profit and his division has been generally followed
the following definitions will best shew the degree of
precision with which these three terms have been em

ployed

ambiguous terms



the first observation to be made on these definitions is

that the rent of land which is only a species of an exten
sive genus is used as a genus and that its cognate species
are either omitted or included under genera to which

they do not properly belong wages and profits are of
human creation they imply a sacrifice of ease or imme
diate enjoyment and bear a ratio to that sacrifice which is
indicated by the common expressions of √¢Äúthe rate of
wages√¢Äù and √¢Äú the rate of profits√¢Äù a ratio which has a
strong tendency to uniformity but there is another and

a very large source of revenue which is not the creation of
man but of nature which owes its origin not to the will
of its possessor but to accident which implies no sacri
fice has no tendency to uniformity and to which the term
√¢Äúrate√¢Äù is seldom applied this revenue arises from the
exclusive right to some instrument of production enabling

the employment of a given amount of labour or capital to
be more than usually productive the principal of these
instruments is land but all extraordinary powers of body
or mindall processes in manufacture which are pro

tected by secrecy or by lawall peculiar advantages
from situation or connexionin short every instrument
of production which is not universally accessible affords a
revenue distinct in its origin from wages or profits and

of which the rent of land is only a species in the clas
sification of revenues either rent ought to have been

omitted as a genus and considered only as an anomalous
interruption of the general uniformity of wages and pro
fits or all the accidental sources of revenue ought to have
been included in one genus of which the rent of land

would have formed the principal species another remark
is that almost all these definitions of profit include the

wages of the labour of the capitalist the continental

economists have in general been aware of this and have



appendix

pointed it out in their analyses of the component parts of
profit

the british economists have seldom entered into

this analysis and the want of it has been a great cause of
obscurity

on the other hand much of what properly belongs to
profit and rent is generally included under wages al
most all economists consider the members of the liberal

professions under the class of labourers the whole sub
sistence of such persons observes mr mculloch√¢Äù is de

rived from wages and they are as evidently labourers
as if they handled the spade or the plough but it should

be considered that those who are engaged in any occupa
tion requiring more skill than that of a common husband
man must have expended capital more or less on the
acquisition of their skill their education must have cost

something in every case from that of the handicraft
apprentice to that of the legal or medical student and
a profit on this outlay is of course looked for as in other
disbursements of capital and the higher profit in propor
tion to the risk viz the uncertainty of a mans success in
his business part therefore and generally far the
greater part of what has been reckoned the wages of his
labour ought more properly to be reckoned profits on the

capital expended in fitting him for that particular kind of
labour and all the excess of gains acquired by one pos

sessing extraordinary talents opportunities or patronage
since these correspond to the possession of landof a
patentright or other monopoly√¢Äìof a secret c may
be more properly regarded as rent than as wages

another most fruitful source of ambiguity arises from
the use of the word wages sometimes as expressing a

quantity sometimes as expressing a proportion
 √¢Äúprinciples√¢Äù c p 

ambiguous terms



in ordinary language wages means the amount of some
commodity generally of silver given to the labourer in
return for a given exertion and they rise or fall as that
amount is increased or diminished

in the language of mr ricardo they usually mean the
labourers proportion of what is produced supposing that
produce to be divided between him and the capitalist in
this sense they generally rise as the whole produce is dimi

nished though if the word be used in the other sense
they generally fall if mr ricardo had constantly used
the word √¢Äúwages√¢Äù to express a proportion the only incon
venience would be the necessity of always translating this
expression into common language but he is not con

sistent when he says√¢Äù that √¢Äúwhatever raises the wages
of labour lowers the profits of stock√¢Äù he considers wages
as a proportion when he sayst that √¢Äúhigh wages en
courage population√¢Äù he considers wages as an amount
even mr mculloch who has clearly explained the

ambiguity has not escaped it he has even suffered it to
affect his reasonings in his valuable essay √¢Äúon the
rate of wages√¢Äùf he admits that √¢Äúwhen wages are

high the capitalist has to pay a larger share of the pro
duce of industry to his labourers√¢Äù an admission utterly
inconsistent with his general use of the word as express
ing the amount of what the labourer receives which as he
has himself observed √¢ß may increase while his proportion
diminishes

 if transportation is not felt as a severe punishment
it is in itself illsuited to the prevention of crime if it is
so felt much of its severity is wasted from its taking
