THE VERY REVEREND

EDWARD COPLESTON, D. D.
PRovost of orieſ, coºr Ege, oxford;
DEAN OF CHESTER, 3c. &c.

MY DEAR Mk. Provost,

To enumerate the advantages I have derived from
your instructions, both in regular lectures and in private
conversation, would be needless to those acquainted with

the parties, and to the Public, uninteresting. My object

at present is simply to acknowledge how greatly I am
indebted to you in respect of the present work; not
merely as having originally imparted to me the principles
of the Science, but also as having contributed remarks,
explanations, and illustrations, relative to the most impor
tant points, to so great an amount that I can hardly con
sider myself as more than half the Author of such portions
of the treatise as are not borrowed from former publica
tions. I could have wished, indeed, to acknowledge this
more explicitly, by marking with some note of distinction
those parts which are least my own; but I found it could
not be done. In most instances there is something be

DEDICATION.

longing to each of us; and even in those parts

where your

share is the largest, it would not be fair that you should
be made responsible for anything that is not entirely your
own. Nor is it possible, in the case of a Science, to re
member distinctly how far one has been in each instance
indebted to the suggestions of another. Information, as
to matters of fact, may easily be referred in the mind to
the person from whom we have derived it: but scientific
truths, when thoroughly embraced, become much more a

part of the mind as it were ; since they rest, not on the
authority of the instructor, but on reasoning from data
which we ourselves furnish: they are scions engrafted on
the stems previously rooted in our own soil; and we are

apt to confound them with its indigenous productions.
You yourself also, I have reason to believe, have for
gotten the greater part of the assistance you have afforded
in the course of conversations on the

subject; as I have

found, more than once, that ideas which I distinctly re

membered to have received from you, have not been recog
nized by you when read or repeated. As far, however, as

I can recollect, though there is no part of the following
pages in which I have not, more or less, received valuable

suggestions from you, I believe you have contributed less
to the Analytical Outline, and to the Treatise on Fallacies,

and more to the subjoined Dissertation, than to the rest of
the Work.

DEDICATION.

V

I take this opportunity of publicly declaring, that as,
on the one hand, you are not responsible for anything con
tained in this Work, so, on the other hand, should you
ever favour the world with a publication of your own on
the subject, the coincidence which will doubtless be found

in it with many things here brought forward as my own,
is not to be regarded as any indication of plagiarism, at
least on your side.
Believe me to be,
Dear Mr. Provost,

Your obliged and affectionate
Pupil and Friend,
R. WHATELY.

PREFACE.

THE following Treatise contains the substance of
the Article “Logic” in the Encyclopædia Metro
politana. It was suggested to me that a separate
publication of it might prove acceptable, not only
to some who are not subscribers to that Treatise,

but also to several who are, but who, for conveni

ence of reference, would prefer a more portable
volume.

I have accordingly revised it, and made such ad
ditions, chiefly in the form of Notes, as I thought
likely to increase its utility.
I have taken without scruple whatever appeared

most valuable, from the works of former writers;
especially the concise, but in general accurate, trea
tise of Aldrich: but while I acknowledge my obli
gations to my predecessors, of whose labours I have
largely availed myself, I do not profess to be alto
gether satisfied with any of the treatises that have
yet appeared; nor have I accordingly judged it any
unreasonable presumption to point out what seem

viii

PREFACE.

to me the errors they contain. Indeed, whatever
deference an Author may profess for the authority
of those who have preceded him, the very circum
stance of his publishing a work on the same sub
ject, proves that he thinks theirs open to improve
ment. In censuring, however, as I have had occa
sion to do, several of the doctrines and explanations

of logical writers, and of Aldrich in particular, I
wish it to be understood that this is not from my
having formed a low estimate of the merits
of the Compendium drawn up by the Author

just mentioned, but, on the contrary, from its de
served popularity,+from the impossibility of no
ticing particularly all the points in which we agree,
—and from the consideration that errors are the

more carefully to be pointed out in proportion to

the authority by which they are sanctioned.
I have also to acknowledge assistance received from
several friends who have at various times suggested
remarks and alterations. But I cannot avoid par

ticularizing the Rev. J. Newman, Fellow of Oriel
College, who actually composed a considerable
portion of the work as it now stands, from manu

scripts not designed for publication, and who is the
original author of several pages. Some valuable
illustrations of the importance of attending to the
ambiguity of the terms used in Political-Economy

have been furnished by the kindness of my friend
and former pupil, Mr. Senior of Magdalen College
and of Lincoln's Inn, now Professor of Political
Economy at Oxford; they are printed in the Ap
pendix. But, the friend to whom it is inscribed
has contributed far more, and that in the most

important parts, than all others together; so much,
indeed, that, though there is in the treatise nothing
of his which has not undergone such expansion or
modification as leaves me solely responsible for the
whole, there is not a little of which I cannot fairly
claim to be the Author.

On the utility of Logic many writers have said
much in which I cannot coincide, and which has

tended to bring the study into unmerited disrepute.
By representing Logic as furnishing the sole instru
ment for the discovery of truth in all subjects, and

as teaching the use of the intellectual faculties in
general, they raised expectations which could not
be realized, and which naturally led to a re-action:
the whole system, whose unfounded pretensions had
been thus blazoned forth, has come to be commonly

regarded as utterly futile and empty: like several of
our most valuable medicines, which, when first

introduced, were proclaimed, each, as a panacea,
infallible in the most opposite disorders; and which

consequently, in many instances, fell for a time into

X.

PREFACE.

total disuse; though, after a long interval, they were
established in their just estimation, and employed
conformably to their real properties.
To explain fully the utility of Logic is what can
be done only in the course of an explanation of the
system itself. One preliminary observation only

(for the original suggestion of which I am indebted
to the same friend to whom this work is inscribed)
it may be worth while to offer in this place. If it
were inquired what is to be regarded as the most
appropriate intellectual occupation of MAN, as
man, what would be the answer? The Statesman is

engaged with political affairs; the Soldier with
military; the Mathematician, with the properties
of numbers and magnitudes; the Merchant, with
commercial concerns, &c.; but in what are all and

each of these employed 2 Evidently in Reasoning.
They are all occupied in deducing, well or ill, Con
clusions from Premises; each, concerning the
Subject of his own particular business. If, there
fore, it be found that the process going on daily in
each of so many different minds is, in any respect,
the same, and if the principles on which it is con
ducted can be reduced to a regular system, and if
rules can be deduced from that system for the bet
ter conducting of the process, then, it can hardly be
denied that such a system and such rules must be

PREFACE.

especially worthy the attention, not of the members

of this or that profession merely, but of every one
who is desirous of possessing a cultivated mind.
To understand the theory of that which is the ap
propriate intellectual occupation of man in general,
and to learn to do that well, which every one will
and must do, whether well or ill, may surely be
considered as an essential part of a liberal education.

Even supposing that no practical improvement

in argumentation resulted from the study of Logic,
it would not by any means follow that it is un
worthy of attention. The pursuit of knowledge on
curious and interesting subjects, for its own sake, is
usually reckoned no misemployment of time, and is
considered as, incidentally, if not directly, useful to
the individual, by the exercise thus afforded to the
mental faculties: all who study Mathematics are
not training themselves to become Surveyors or
Mechanics: some knowledge of Anatomy and Che
mistry is even expected in a man liberally educated,

though without any view to his practising Surgery
or Medicine. The investigation of a process
which is peculiarly and universally the occupation
of man, considered as man, can hardly be reckoned
a less philosophical pursuit than those just in
stanced.

It has usually been assumed, however, in the case

xii

PREFACE.

of the present subject, that a theory which does not
tend to the improvement of practice is utterly
unworthy of regard; and then it is contended that
Logic has no such tendency, on the plea that men
may and do reason correctly without it: an objec
tion which would equally apply in the case of
Grammar, Music, Chemistry, Mechanics, &c., in
all of which systems the practice must have existed
previously to the theory. But many who allow the

use of systematic principles in other things are ac
customed to cry up Common-Sense as the sufficient
and only safe guide in Reasoning. Now by Com
mon-Sense is meant, I apprehend, (when the term is

used with any distinct meaning.) an exercise of the
judgment unaided by any Art or system of rules ;
such as we must necessarily employ in numberless
cases of daily occurrence; in which, having no es

tablished principles to guide us, no line of proce
dure, as it were, distinctly chalked out, we must
needs act on the best extemporaneous conjectures
we can form. He who is eminently skilful in
doing this, is said to possess a superior degree of
Common-Sense. But that Common-Sense is only

our second-best guide—that the rules of Art, if judi
ciously framed, are always desirable when they
can be had, is an assertion, for the truth of which

I may appeal to the testimony of Mankind in

PREFACE.

xiii

general; which is so much the more valuable, in
asmuch as it may be accounted the testimony of
adversaries. For the generality have a strong predi
lection in favour of Common-Sense, except in those
points in which they, respectively, possess the
knowledge of a system of rules; but in these points
they deride any one who trusts to unaided Common
Sense. A sailor, e.g., will perhaps despise the
pretensions of medical men, and prefer treating a

disease by Common-Sense: but he would ridicule
the proposal of navigating a ship by Common
Sense, without regard to the maxims of nautical
art. A physician, again, will perhaps contemn

Systems of Political-Economy, of Logic, or Me
taphysics, and insist on the superior wisdom of
trusting to Common-Sense in such matters; but
he would never approve of trusting to Common
Sense in the treatment of diseases. Neither, again,
would the architect

recommond a reliance on Com

mon-Sense alone in building, nor the musician in
music, to the neglect of those systems of rules,
which, in their respective arts, have been deduced

from scientific reasoning aided by experience.

And the Induction might be extended to every de
partment of practice. Since, therefore, each gives
the preference to unassisted Common-Sense only in

those cases where he himself has nothing else to

xiv.

PREFACE.

trust to, and invariably resorts to the rules of art,
wherever he possesses the knowledge of them, it is

plain that mankind universally bear their testimony,
though unconsciously and often unwillingly, to the

preferableness of systematic knowledge to conjectu
ral judgments.
It was doubtless from a strong and deliberate con
viction of the advantages, direct and indirect, accru
ing from an acquaintance with Logic, that the Uni
-

versity of Oxford, when re-modelling their system,

not only retained that branch of study, regardless
of the clamours of many of the half-learned, but
even assigned a prominent place to it, by making it
an indispensable part of the examination for the
first degree. This last circumstance, however, I
am convinced has, in a great degree, produced an

effect opposite to what was designed: it has contri
buted to lower instead of exalting the estimation of
the study, and to withhold from it the earnest at

tention of many who might have applied to it with
profit.

I am not so weak as to imagine that any

System can ensure great proficiency in any pursuit
whatever, either in all students, or in a very large
proportion of them : “we sow many seeds to
obtain a few flowers;” but it might have been ex

pected (and doubtless was expected) that a majority
at least of successful candidates would derive some

PREFACE.

benefit worth mentioning from their logical pur
suits; and that a considerable proportion of the dis
tinguished candidates would prove respectable, if

not eminent logicians. Such expectations I do not
censure as unreasonable, or such as I might not

have formed myself, had I been called upon to judge
at that period when our experience was all to come.

But that experience has shown that those expecta
tions have been very inadequately realized. The
truth is, that a very small proportion even of dis
tinguished students ever become good logicians;

and that by far the greater part pass through the
University without knowing any thing at all of it;

I do not mean that they have not learned by rote a

string of technical terms; but that they understand
absolutely nothing whatever of the principles of the
Science. I am aware that some injudicious friends
of Oxford will censure the frankness of this avowal:

I have only to reply that such is the truth; and that
I think too well of, and know far too well, the

University in which I have been employed in various
academical occupations above eighteen years, to

apprehend danger to her reputation from declaring
the exact truth.

With all its defects, and no

human institution is perfect, the University would

stand, I am convinced, higher in public estimation

than it does, were the whole truth, and nothing but

xvi

PRFFACE.

the truth, in all points respecting it, more fully
known. But the scanty and partial success of the
measures employed to promote logical studies is
the consequence, I apprehend, of the universality
of the requisition. That which must be done by

every one will, of course, often be done very indiffe
rently; and when the belief is once fully established,
which it certainly is, that anything which is indis

pensable to a testimonial has little or nothing to
do with the attainment of honours, the lowest stan
dard soon becomes the established one in the minds

of the greater part; and provided that standard be
once reached, so as to secure the candidate from

rejection, a greater or less proficiency in any such
branch of study is regarded as a matter of indiffer
ence, as far as any views of academical distinction
are concerned. Divinity is one of these branches;
and to this also most of what has been said con

cerning Logic might be considered as equally appli
cable; but, in fact, there are several important differ
ences between the two cases. In the first place,

most of the students who are designed for the
Church, and many who are not, have a value for

theological knowledge independently of the requi
sition of the schools; and on that ground do not
confine their views to the lowest admissible degree

of proficiency: whereas this can be said of very few,

PREFACE.

xvii

in the case of Logic. But a consideration, which is
still more to the present purpose, is, that Theology,
not being a Science, admits of infinite degrees of pro
ficiency, from that which is within the reach of a
child, up to the highest that is attainable by the most

exalted genius; every one of which degrees is ines
timably valuable as far as it goes: if any one under
stands tolerably the Church-catechism, or even the
half of it, he knows something of divinity; and that
something is incalculably preferable to nothing.
But it is not so with a Science : one who does not

understand the principles of Euclid's demonstrations,
whatever number of questions and answers he may

have learnt by rote, knows absolutely nothing of
geometry: unless he attain this point, all his labour
is utterly lost; worse than lost, perhaps, if he is led

to believe that he has learnt something of a Science,
when, in truth, he has not.

And the same is the

case with Logic, or any other Science. It does not
admit of such various degrees, as a knowledge of

religion. Of course I am far from supposing, that
all who understand anything at all of Logic stand

on the same level; but I mean, what is surely un
deniable, that one who does not embrace the fun

damental principles of that or any other Science,
whatever he may have taken on authority, and
learned by rote, knows, properly speaking, nothing
b

xviii

PREFACE.

of that Science. And such, I have no hesitation in
saying, is the case with a considerable proportion
even of those candidates who obtain testimonials,

including many who gain distinction. There are
some persons, (probably not above one in ten, of
such as have in other respects tolerable abilities,)
who are physically incapable of the degree of steady
abstraction requisite for really embracing the prin
ciples of Logic or of any other Science, whatever
pains may be taken by themselves or their teachers.
But there is a much greater number to whom this
is a great difficulty, though not an impossibility;
and who having, of course, a strong disinclination
to such a study, look naturally to the very lowest
admissible standard. And the example of such
examinations in Logic as must be expected in the

case of men of these descriptions, tends, in combi
nation with popular prejudice, to degrade the study
altogether in the minds of the greater part. It was
from these considerations, perhaps, that it was pro

posed, not long since, to leave the study of Logic
altogether to the option of the candidates; but the
suggestion was rejected; the majority appearing to
think (in which opinion I most fully coincide) that,
so strongly as the tide of popular opinion sets against
the study, the result would have been, within a few
years, an almost universal neglect of that Science.

PREFACE.

xix

Matters were left accordingly, in respect of this
point, on their former footing; which I am con
vinced is far preferable to the proposed alteration.
But there is a middle course between these two,

which I am persuaded would be infinitely preferable
to either; a persuasion which I have long enter
tained, and which is confirmed by every day's obser
vations and reflections, of which few, I believe, have

bestowed more on this subject. Let the study of
Logic be made optional to those who are merely can
didates for a degree, but indispensable to the attain
ment of academical honours, and I am ready to pledge
myself that it would speedily begin, and progres
sively continue, to rise in estimation and to be stu
died with real profit. The examination might then,
without any hardship, be made a strict one; since

no one could complain that a certain moderate
degree of scientific ability, and a resolution to apply
to a certain prescribed study, should be the condi

tions of obtaining distinction. The far greater part
would still study Logic, since there would be (as
now) but few who would be willing to exclude
themselves from the possibility of obtaining distinc
tion; but it would be studied with a very different
mind, when ennobled, as it were, by being made
part of the passport to University-honours, and
when a proficiency in it came to be regarded gene

PREFACE.

rally as an honourable distinction. And in propor
tion as the number increased of those who really
understood the Science, the number would increase
of such as would value it on higher and better

grounds. It would in time come to be better known
and better appreciated by all the well-informed part
of society. These effects could not indeed be ex
pected to show themselves fully till after a consi
derable lapse of time; but that the change would
begin to appear, and that very decidedly, within
three or four years, I am perfectly confident. My
earnest wishes for so important, yet so easy and
simple an alteration are not unaccompanied with

sanguine hopes that, before long, it may take place;
from the candid and judicious readiness which has
been shown to introduce, from time to time, such

improvements as careful inquiry and sound reason
ing suggest.

I am sensible that many may object, that this is
not the proper place for such remarks as the fore
going: what has the public at large, they may say,
to do with the statutes of the University of Oxford?
To this it might fairly be replied, that not only all

who think of sending their sons or other near rela
tives to Oxford, but all likewise who are placed
under the ministry of such as have been educated

there, are indirectly concerned, to a certain degree,

PREFACE.

xxi

in the system there pursued. But the consideration
which had the chief share in inducing me to say what
I have, is that the vindication of Logic from the
prevailing disregard and contempt under which it
labours, would have been altogether incomplete
without it.

For let it be remembered that the

Science is judged of by the Public in this country,
in a very great degree, from the specimens displayed
and the reports made by those whom Oxford sends
forth; every one, on looking into the University
Calendar or Statute Book, feels himself justified in

assuming, that whoever has graduated at Oxford
must be a Logician : not, indeed, necessarily a first
rate Logician, but such as to satisfy the public exa
miners that he has a competent knowledge of the
Science. Now, if a very large proportion of these
persons neither are, nor think themselves at all
benefited by their (so called) logical education, and

if many of them treat the study with contempt, and
represent it as a mere tissue of obsolete and empty

jargon, which it is a mere waste of time to attend to,
let any one judge what conclusions respecting the
utility of the study, and the wisdom of the Uni
versity in upholding it, are likely to be the result.

That prejudices so deeply-rooted as those I have
alluded to, and supported by the authority of such
eminent names, especially that of Locke, and (as is

xxii

PREFACE.

commonly, though not very correctly supposed)
Bacon, should be overthrown at once by the present
treatise, I am not so sanguine as to expect; but if

I have been successful in refuting some of the most

popular objections, and explaining some principles
which are in general ill-understood, it may be hoped
that in time just notions on the subject may gain
ground: especially if, as I have some reason to
hope, a more able advocate of the same cause should
be induced to step forward.

It may be permitted me to mention, that as I have
addressed myself to various classes of students, from
the most uninstructed tyro, to the furthest-advanced

Logician, and have touched accordingly both on the

most elementary principles, and on some of the
most remote deductions from them, it must be ex

pected that readers of each class will find some parts
not well-calculated for them.

Some explanations

will appear to the one too simple and puerile; and
for another class, some of the disquisitions will be
at first too abstruse. If to each description some

portions are found interesting, it is as much as I
can expect.

With regard to the style, I have considered

perspicuily not only, as it always must be, the
first point, but as one of such paramount import
ance in such a subject, as to justify the neglect of

PREFACE.

xxiii

all others. Prolixity of explanation,-homeliness
in illustration,-and baldness of expression, I have

regarded as blemishes not worth thinking of, when
anything was to be gained in respect of clearness.
Of the correctness of the fundamental doctrines

maintained in the work, I may be allowed to feel
some confidence; not so much from the length of
time (about fourteen years) that I have been more
or less occupied with it, enjoying at the same time
the advantage of frequent suggestions and correc
tions from several judicious friends, as from the
nature of the subject. In works of taste, an author
cannot be sure that the judgment of the public will
coincide with his own; and if he fail to give plea

sure, he fails of his sole, or most appropriate object.
But in the case of truths which admit of Scientific

demonstration, it is possible to arrive by reasoning
at as full an assurance of the justness of the conclu
sions established, as the imperfection of the human

faculties will admit; and experience, accompanied
with attentive observation, and with repeated trials

of various methods, may enable one long accustomed

to tuition to ascertain with considerable certainty
what explanations are the best comprehended.

Many parts of the detail, however, may probably
be open to objections; but if no errors are disco

vered, which materially affect the substantial utility

xxiv.

PREFACE.

of the work, but only such as detract from the
credit of the author, the object will have been at
tained which I ought to have had principally in view.

No credit, I am aware, is given to an author's
own disclaimer of personal motives, and profession

of exclusive regard for public utility; since even
sincerity cannot, on this point, secure him from de

ceiving himself; but it may be allowable to observe
that one whose object is the increase of his reputa
tion as a writer, can hardly choose a subject less

suitable for his purpose than the present. It is far
from a popular one, and not likely to become so, in
any considerable degree, at least during the life

time of a writer of the present day. Ignorance,
fortified by prejudice, opposes its reception, even in
the minds of those who are considered as both can

did and well-informed.

Besides that a great ma

jority of readers not only know not what Logic is,
but have no curiosity to learn, the greater part of
those who imagine that they do know, are wedded
to erroneous notions of it.

The multitude never

think of paying any attention to the correctness of .
their reasoning; and those who do, are usually too
confident that they are already completely successful
in this point, to endure the thought of seeking
instruction upon it.

And as, on the one hand, a large class of modern

PREFACE.

XXV’

philosophers may be expected to raise a clamour
against “obsolete prejudices;” “bigoted devotion
to the decrees of Aristotle;” “confining the human
mind in the trammels of the Schoolmen,” &c. so,

on the other hand, all such as really are thus bigot
ed to everything that has been long established,

for that reason alone, will be ready to exclaim
against the presumption of an author, who presumes
to depart in several points from the track of his pre
decessors.

-

There is another circumstance, also, which tends
materially to diminish the credit of a writer on this
and some other kindred subjects. We can make
no discoveries of striking novelties: the senses of
our readers are not struck, as with the return of a
Comet which had been foretold, or the extinction

of a taper in carbonic-acid gas: the materials we
work

upon are

common and familiar to all, and,

therefore, supposed to be well understood by all :
and not only is any one's deficiency in the use of
these materials, such as is generally unfelt by him
self, but when it is removed by satisfactory expla
nations—when the notions, which had been per

plexed and entangled, are cleared up by the introduc
tion of a few simple and apparently obvious prin

ciples, he will generally forget that any explana
tion at all was needed, and consider all that has

xxvi

PREFACE.

been said as mere truisms, which even a child could

supply to himself. Such is the nature of the fun
damental principles of a Science—they are so fully
implied in the most evident and well-known truths,
that the moment they are fullyembraced, it becomes
a difficulty to conceive that we could ever have been
not aware of them. And hence, the more simple,

clear, and obvious any principle is rendered, the
more likely is its exposition to elicit those common
remarks, “ of course! of course!” “no one could
ever doubt that;” “this is all very true, but there
is nothing new brought to light;-nothing that was

not familiar to every one;” “there needs no ghost
to tell us that.”

I am convinced, that a verbose,

mystical, and partially obscure way of writing on
such a subject is the most likely to catch the atten
tion of the multitude. The generality verify the
observation of Tacitus, “omne ignotum pro miri
fico:” and when anything is made very plain to

them, are apt to fancy that they knew it already;
so that the explanations of scientific truths are
likely, for a considerable time at least, to be, by
most men, underrated the more, the more perfectly
they accomplish their object.

A very slow progress, therefore, towards popu
larity is the utmost that can be expected for such a
treatise as I have endeavoured to make the present.

PREFACE.

xxvii

I have felt myself bound, however, not only as a
member of Society, but more especially as a minis

ter of the Gospel, to use my endeavours towards
promoting an object which to me appears highly

important, and, what is much more, whose import
ance is appreciated by very few besides. The cause
of Truth universally, and not least, of religious

Truth, is benefited by everything that tends to
promote sound reasoning and facilitate the detec
tion of fallacy. The adversaries of our Faith would,

I am convinced, have been on many occasions more
satisfactorily answered, and would have had fewer
openings for cavil, had a thorough acquaintance
with Logic been a more common qualification than
it is. In lending my endeavours, therefore, whether

with greater or less success, towards this object, I
trust that I am neither uselessly nor unsuitably
employed.
Those who are engaged in, or designed for the
Sacred Ministry, and all others who are sensible that
the cause of true Religion is not a concern of the

Ministry alone, should remember that this is no
time to forego any of the advantages which that

cause may derive from an active and judicious cul
tivation of the faculties. Among the enemies of
Christianity in the present day are included, if I

mistake not, a very different description of persons

from those who were chiefly to be met with a cen
tury, or even half a century ago: what were called
“men of wit and pleasure about Town;”—ignorant,
shallow, flippant declaimers, or dull and powerless
pretenders to Philosophy. Among the enemies of
the Gospel now, are to be found men not only of
learning and of ingenuity, but of cultivated, argu
mentative powers, not unversed in the principles of
Logic.

If the advocates

of our Religion think pro

per to disregard this help, they will find, on careful
inquiry, that their opponents do not.

And let them

not trust too carelessly to the strength of their
cause: Truth will, indeed, prevail where all other
points are nearly equal; but it may suffer a tempo

arguments, and vague and empty declamation, oc

cupy the place of a train of close, accurate, and
luminous reasoning.
It is not, however, solely or chiefly for polemical

purposes that the cultivation of the reasoning
faculty is desirable; in persuading and investigating,
in learning or teaching, in all the multitude of
cases in which it is our object to arrive at just
conclusions, or to lead others to them, it is most
important. A knowledge of logical rules will not

indeed supply the want of other knowledge; nor

it is no less true that no other can be substituted

for this that it is valuable in every branch of study,
and that it enables us to use the knowledge we pos
sess to the greatest advantage. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that those academical bodies, who have

been wise enough to retain this Science, will, instead
of being persuaded to abandon it, give their atten
tion rather to its improvement and more effectual
cultivation.

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

INTRODUCTION.

LOGIC, in the most extensive sense which the Fºr "
name can with propriety be made to bear, may
be considered as the Science, and also as the

Art, of Reasoning. It investigates the princi
ples on which argumentation is conducted, and
furnishes rules to secure the mind from error

in its deductions. Its most appropriate office,
however, is that of instituting an analysis of the
process of the mind in Reasoning; and in this
point of view it is, as has been stated, strictly
a Science: while considered in reference to the

practical rules above mentioned, it may be
called the Art of Reasoning. This distinction,
as will hereafter appear, has been overlooked,
or not clearly pointed out by most writers on
the subject, Logic having been in general re
garded as merely an art; and its claim to hold

a place among the sciences having been ex
pressly denied.

ELEMENTs of Logic.

Considering how early Logic attracted the
attention of philosophers, it may appear sur

prising that so little progress should have been
made, as is confessedly the case, in developing
its principles, and perfecting the detail of the
system; and this circumstance has been
brought forward as a proof of the barrenness
and futility of the study. But a similar argu
ment might have been urged with no less
plausibility, at a period not very remote, against
the study of Natural Philosophy; and very re
cently against that of Chemistry. No science
can be expected to make any considerable pro
gress, which is not cultivated on right princi
ples. Whatever may be the inherent vigour of
the plant, it will neither be flourishing nor fruit
ful till it meet with a suitable soil and culture:

and in no case is the remark more applicable
than in the present; the greatest mistakes hav

ing always prevailed respecting the nature of
Logic, and its province having in consequence
been extended by many writers to subjects
with which it has no proper connexion.

In

deed, with the exception of Aristotle (who is
himself not entirely exempt from the errors in
question) hardly a writer on Logic can be
mentioned who has clearly perceived, and
steadily kept in view throughout, its real na
ture and object.

Before his time, no distinc

tion was drawn between the science of which

INTRODUCTION.

we are speaking, and that which is now usually
called Metaphysics; a circumstance which

alone shows how small was the progress made
in earlier times. Indeed those who first turned

their attention to the subject, hardly thought
of inquiring into the process of Reasoning it
self, but confined themselves almost entirely to
certain preliminary points, the discussion of

which is (if logically considered) subordinate
to that of the main inquiry.

subject of Logic, or as it was then called, Dia
lectics, divided his work into three parts; the
the first of which (upon consequences) is cen

sured by Socrates [Plato, Parmen.] for ob
scurity and confusion. In his second part,
however, he furnished that interrogatory me

thod of disputation [ig&rnail which Socrates
adopted, and which has since borne his name.
The third part of his work was devoted to
what may not improperly be termed the art of

wrangling [igarººl, which supplied the dispu
tant with a collection of sophistical questions,
so contrived, that the concession of some

point which seemed unavoidable, immediately
involved some glaring absurdity. This, if it is
to be esteemed as at all falling within the pro
vince of Logic, is certainly not to be regarded
(as some have ignorantly or heedlessly repre
B2

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

sented it) as its principal or proper business.
The Greek philosophers generally have unfor
tunately devoted too much attention to it; but
we must beware of falling into the vulgar
error of supposing the ancients to have re
garded as a serious and intrinsically important
study, that which in fact they considered as an
ingenious recreation. The disputants diverted
themselves in their leisure hours by making
trial of their own and their adversary's acute
ness, in the endeavour mutually to perplex
each other with subtle fallacies; much in the

same way as men amuse themselves with pro
pounding and guessing riddles, or with the
game of chess; to each of which diversions
the sportive disputations of the ancients bore
much resemblance. They were closely analo

gous to the wrestling and other exercises of
the Gymnasium; these last being reckoned
conducive to bodily vigour and activity, as the
former were to habits of intellectual acuteness:

but the immediate object in each was a sport
ive, not a serious contest; though doubtless
fashion and emulation often occasioned an

undue importance to be attached to success in
each.
Zeno.

Zeno, then, is hardly to be regarded as any

further a logician than as to what respects his
erotetic method of disputation; a course of

argument constructed on this principle being

INTRODUCTION.

properly an hypothetical sorites, which may
easily be reduced into a series of syllogisms.

To Zeno succeeded Euclid of Megara, and flºº.
Antisthenes, both pupils of Socrates. The
former of these prosecuted the subject of the

third part of his predecessor's treatise, and is
said to have been the author of many of the
fallacies attributed to the Stoical school.

Of

the writings of the latter nothing certain is
known; if, however, we suppose the above
mentioned sect to be his disciples in this study,
and to have retained his principles, he certainly
took a more correct view of the subject than
Euclid. The stoics divided all xexrd, every
thing that could be said, into three classes:
1st, the simple Term ; 2d, the Proposition;

3d, the Syllogism; viz. the hypothetical; for
they seem to have had little notion of a more
rigorous analysis of argument than into that
familiar form.

doctrine of the Categories. He, however, (as
well as the other writers on the subject) ap
pears to have had no distinct view of the pro
per object and just limits of the science of

Logic; but to have blended with it metaphy
sical discussions not strictly connected with it,

and to have dwelt on the investigation of the
nature of terms and propositions, without

maintaining a constant reference to the prin
ciples of Reasoning, to which all the rest should
be made subservient.
Aristotle.

The state, then, in which Aristotle found the
science (if indeed it can properly be said to
have existed at all before his time) appears to
have been nearly this: the division into sim
ple Terms, Propositions and Syllogisms, had

been slightly sketched out; the doctrine of the
Categories, and perhaps that of the opposition
of propositions, had been laid down; and, as
some believe, the analysis of Species into Genus
and Differentia, had been introduced by So
crates. These, at best, were rather the mate
rials of the system, than the system itself; the
foundation of which indeed he distinctly claims

the merit of having laid, and which remains
fundamentally the same as he left it.
It has been remarked, that the logical sys
tem is one of those few theories which have

been begun and perfected by the same indivi
dual. The history of its discovery, as far as
the main principles of the science are con
cerned, properly commences and ends with

Aristotle; and this may perhaps in part ac
count for the subsequent perversions of it.
The brevity and simplicity of its fundamental
truths (to which point indeed all real science

is perpetually tending) has probably led many
to suppose that something much more com

INTRODUCTION.

plex, abtruse, and mysterious, remained to be
discovered. The vanity too by which all men
are prompted unduly to magnify their own
pursuits, has led unphilosophical minds, not in
this case alone, but in many others, to extend
the boundaries of their respective sciences, not
by the patient developement and just applica

tion of the principles of those sciences, but by
wandering into irrelevant subjects. The mys
tical employment of numbers by Pythagoras,
in matters utterly foreign to arithmetic, is per
haps the earliest instance of the kind. A more

curious and important one is the degeneracy of
Astronomy into judicial Astrology; but none

or who have intruded it into the province of

natural philosophy, and regarded the Syllogism

while they overlooked the boundless field that

science, as unserviceable in the discovery of
truth (which has of late been often repeated),
while it holds good in reference to many (mis
named) logicians, indicates that, with regard to
the

true nature of the science itself, he had no

clearer notions than they have, of the proper
province of Logic, viz. Reasoning; and of the
distinct character of that operation from the
observations and experiments which are essen
tial to the study of nature.

tially the same, pervades the treatises of Watts watts.
and other modern writers on the subject.

had attempted to apply it, he still craved after
the attainment of some equally comprehensive
and all-powerful system ; which he according

ly attempted to construct, under the title of
The Right Use of Reason, which was to be a
method of invigorating and properly directing
all the powers of the mind—a most magnifi
cent object indeed, but one which not only
does not fall under the province of Logic, but
cannot be accomplished by any one science or
system that can even be conceived to exist.
The attempt to comprehend so wide a field is
no extension of science, but a mere verbal ge
neralization, which leads only to vague and
barren declamation. In every pursuit, the
more precise and definite our object, the more
likely we are to attain some valuable result ;

if, like the Platonists, who sought after the
aúráyz}oy, the abstract idea of good, we pur
sue some specious but ill-defined scheme of
universal knowledge, we shall lose the'sub
stance while grasping at a shadow, and be
wilder ourselves in empty generalities,
It is not perhaps much to be wondered at,
that in still later times several ingenious wri
ters, forming their notions of the science itself
from professed masters in it, such as havejust
been alluded to, and judging of its value from
their failures, should have treated the Aristo

telic system with so much reprobation and

scorn. Too much prejudiced to bestow on it
the requisite attention for enabling them clearly
to understand its real character and object, or
even to judge correctly from the little they
did understand, they have assailed the study

with a host of objections, so totally irrelevant,
and consequently impotent, that, considering
the talents and general information of those
from whom they proceed, they might excite
astonishment in any one who did not fully
estimate the force of very early prejudice.

Logic has usually been considered by these views
incorres;of the
objectors as professing to furnish a peculiar.""
method of reasoning, instead of a method of
analyzing that mental process which must in
variably take place in all correct reasoning;

and accordingly they have contrasted the or
dinary mode of reasoning with the syllogistic,
and have brought forward with an air of
triumph the argumentative skill of many who

never learned the system; a mistake no less
gross than if any one should regard Grammar
as a peculiar Language, and should contend
against its utility, on the ground that many

speak correctly who never studied the prin

ciples of grammar. For Logic, which is, as it
were, the Grammar of Reasoning, does not
bring forward the regular Syllogism as a dis
tinct mode of argumentation, designed to be
substituted for any other mode; but as the

12

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

form to which all correct reasoning may be

ultimately reduced; and which, consequently,
serves the purpose (when we are employing
Logic as an art) of a test to try the validity of
any argument; in the same manner as by che
mical analysis we develope and submit to a
distinct examination the elements of which

any compound body is composed, and are thus

enabled to detect any latent sophistication and
impurity.

Complaints have also been made that logic
leaves untouched the greatest difficulties, and
those which are the sources of the chief errors

in reasoning; viz. the ambiguity or indistinct
ness of Terms, and the doubts respecting the

degrees of evidence in various Propositions:
an objection which is not to be removed by
any such attempt as that of Watts to lay down

“rules for forming clear ideas, and for guiding
the judgment;” but by replying that no art is
to be censured for not teaching more than falls
within its province, and indeed more than can

be taught by any conceivable art. Such a sys
tem of universal knowledge as should instruct
us in the full meaning or meanings of very term,
and the truth or falsity, certainty or uncer
tainty,+of every proposition, thus superseding
all other studies, it is most unphilosophical to
expect, or even to imagine.

And to find fault

with Logic for not performing this, is as if one

INTRODUCTION.

13

should object to the science of Optics for not
giving sight to the blind; or as if (like the

man of whom Warburton tells a story in his
Div. Leg.) one should complain of a reading
glass for being of no service to a person who
had never learned to read.

In fact, the difficulties and errors above

alluded to are not in the process of Reasoning
itself (which alone is the appropriate province
of logic) but in the subject-matter about
which it is employed. This process will have
been correctly conducted if it have conformed

to the logical rules, which preclude the possi
bility of any error creeping in between the
principles from which we are arguing, and the
conclusions we deduce from them.

But still

that conclusion may be false, if the principles
we start from are so.

In like manner, no

arithmetical skill will secure a correct result

to a calculation, unless the data are correct
from which we calculate: nor does any one
on that account undervalue Arithmetic; and

yet the objection against logic rests on no
better foundation.

There is in fact a striking analogy in this
respect between the two sciences. All Num
bers (which are the subject of arithmetic) must
be numbers of some things, whether coins, per
sons, measures, or any thing else; but to in

troduce into the science any notice of the

14

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

things respecting which calculations are made,
would be evidently irrelevant, and would de
stroy its scientific character: we proceed there-fore with arbitrary signs representing numbers
in the abstract. So also does Logic pronounce

on the validity of a regularly-constructed ar
gument, equally well, though arbitrary symbols
may have been substituted for the terms; and,
consequently, without any regard to the
things signified by those terms. And the pos
sibility of doing this (though the employment
of such arbitrary symbols has been absurdly
objected to, even by writers who understood
not only Arithmetic but Algebra) is a proof of
the strictly scientific character of the system.

But many professed logical writers, not at
tending to the circumstances which have been

just mentioned, have wandered into disquisi
tions on various branches of knowledge;

dis

quisitions which must evidently be as bound
less as human knowledge itself, since there is
no subject on which Reasoning is not employed,
and to which, consequently, logic may not be
applied. The error lies in regarding every
thing as the proper province of Logic, to which
it is applicable. A similar error is complained
of by Aristotle, as having taken place with
respect to rhetoric; of which, indeed, we find
specimens in the arguments of several of the
interlocutors in Cic. de Oratore.

INTRODUCTION.

15

From what has been said, it will be evident

that there is hardly any subject to which it is
so difficult to introduce the student in a clear

and satisfactory manner, as the one we are
now engaged in. In any other branch of

knowledge, the reader, if he have any previous
acquaintance with the subject, will usually be
so far the better prepared for comprehending
the exposition of the principles; or if he be
entirely a stranger to it, will at least come to

the study with a mind unbiassed, and free from
prejudices and misconceptions: whereas, in
the present case, it cannot but happen, that
many who have given some attention to logi
cal pursuits (or what are usually considered
as such) will have rather been bewildered by
fundamentally erroneous views, than prepared,

by the acquisition of just principles, for ulterior
progress; and that not a few who pretend not
to any acquaintance whatever with the science,

will yet have imbibed either such prejudices
against it, or such false notions respecting its
nature, as cannot but prove obstacles in their
study of it,
There is, however, a difficulty which exists
more or less in all abstract pursuits; though
it is perhaps more felt in this, and often occa

sions it to be rejected by beginners as dry and
tedious ; viz. the difficulty of perceiving to

what ultimate end,-to what practical or inte

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

resting application—the abstract principles lead
which are first laid before the student; so that

he will often have to work his way patiently

through the most laborious part of the system
before he can gain any clear idea of the drift
and intention of it.

This complaint has often been made by
chemical students, who are wearied with de

scriptions of oxygen, hydrogen, and other in
visible elements, before they have any know
ledge respecting such bodies as commonly
present themselves to the senses. And ac

cordingly some teachers of chemistry obviate
in a great degree this objection, by adopting
the analytical instead of the synthetical mode
of procedure, when they are first introducing
the subject to beginners; i.e. instead of syn
thetically enumerating the elementary sub
stances,<-proceeding next to the simplest com
binations of these, and concluding with those

more complex substances which are of the
most common occurrence, they begin by ana
lyzing these last, and resolving them step by
step into their simple elements ; thus at once
presenting the subject in an interesting point
of view, and clearly setting forth the object of
it. The synthetical form of teaching is in
deed sufficiently interesting to one who has

made considerable progress in any study ; and
being more concise, regular, and systematic,

INTRODUCTION.

17

is the form in which our knowledge naturally
arranges itself in the mind, and is retained by
the memory: but the analytical is the more
interesting, easy, and natural kind of introduc
tion, as being the form in which the first in
vention or discovery of any kind of system
must originally have taken place.

It may be advisable, therefore, to begin by
giving a slight sketch, in this form, of the lo
gical system, before we enter regularly upon
the details of it. The reader will thus be pre
sented with a kind of imaginary history of the
course of inquiry by which the logical system
may be conceived to have occurred to a phi
losophical mind.

CHAPTER I.
ANALYTICAL OUTLINE OF THE SCIENCE.

§ 1.

IN every instance in which we reason, in the
strict sense of the word, i. e. make use of argu

ments, whether for the sake of refuting an ad
versary, or of conveying instruction, or of
satisfying our own minds on any point, what

ever may be the subject we are engaged on, a
certain process takes place in the mind, which
is one and the same in all cases, provided it be
correctly conducted.

Of course it cannot be supposed that every
one is even conscious of this process in his own

mind; much less, is competent to explain the
principles on which it proceeds; which indeed
is, and cannot but be, the case with every other
process respecting which any system has been
formed ; the practice not only may exist in
dependently of the theory, but must have pre
ceded the theory; there must have been Lan
guage before a system of Grammar could be
devised; and musical compositions previous
to the science of Music. This, by the way,
will serve to expose the futility of the popular

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

19

objection against Logic, that men may reason
very well who know nothing of it *. The pa
rallel instances adduced, shew that such an
* Locke has a great deal to this purpose; e.g. in
chap. xvii. “on Reason,” (which, by the way, he perpe
tually confounds with Reasoning.) He says, in §4,” If syl
logisms must be taken for the only proper instrument of
reason and means of knowledge, it will follow, that before
Aristotle there was not one man that did or could know

any thing by reason; and that since the invention of syl
logisms there is not one in ten thousand that doth. But

God has not been so sparing to men to make them barely
two-legged creatures, and left it to Aristotle to make them
rational, i. e. those few of them that he could get so to
examine the grounds of syllogisms, as to see that in above
threescore ways that three propositions may be laid toge
ther, there are but fourteen wherein one may be sure that
the conclusion is right,” &c. &c. “God has been more
bountiful to mankind than so: He has given them a mind
that can reason without being instructed in methods of
syllogizing,” &c. &c. All this is not at all less absurd than
if any one, on being told of the discoveries of modern
chemists respecting caloric, and on hearing described the
process by which it is conducted through a boiler into the

water, which it converts into a gas of sufficient elasticity
to overcome the pressure of the atmosphere, &c., should
reply, “If all this were so, it would follow that before the
time of these chemists no one ever did or could make any
liquor boil.”
In an ordinary, obscure, and trifling writer, all this
confusion of thought and common-place declamation
might as well have been left unnoticed; but it is due to
the general ability and to the celebrity of such an author
as Locke, that errors of this kind should be exposed.
He presently after inserts an encomium upon Aristotle,
in which he is equally unfortunate; he praises him for
the “invention of syllogisms;” to which he certainly had
no more claim than Linnaeus to the creation of plants and
animals, or Hervey to the praise of having made the blood
C 2

20

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

objection might be applied in many other
cases, where its absurdity would be obvious;
and that there is no ground for deciding thence,
either that the system has no tendency to im
prove practice, or that even if it had not, it
might not still be a dignified and interesting
pursuit.
One of the chief impediments to the attain
ment of a just view of the nature and object of

logic, is the not fully understanding, or not
sufficiently keeping in mind, the sameNess of
the reasoning process in all cases. If, as the
ordinary mode of speaking would seem to in

dicate, mathematical reasoning, and theologi
cal, and metaphysical, and political, &c. were
essentially different from each other, i.e. dif
ferent kinds of reasoning, it would follow, that
supposing there could be at all any such
science as we have described Logic, there must
be so many different species, or at least differ
ent branches of Logic. And such is perhaps

the most prevailing notion. Nor is this much
to be wondered at ; since it is evident to all
circulate, or Lavoisier to that of having formed the atmo
sphere we breathe. And the utility of this invention con
sists, according to him, in the great service done against
those who were not ashamed to deny anything ; a service

which never could have been performed, had syllogisms
been an invention of Aristotle's; for what sophist could
ever have consented to restrict himself to one particular
kind of arguments, dictated by his opponent?

by considering the parallel instance of Arith
metic, in which every one is aware that the
process of a calculation is not affected by the
nature of the objects whose numbers are be
fore us : but that (e.g.) the multiplication of
a number is the very same operation, whether
it be a number of men, of miles, or of pounds;

though nevertheless persons may perhaps be
found who are accurate in calculations relative

to natural philosophy, and incorrect in those of
political economy, from their different degrees
of skill in the subjects of these two sciences;
not surely because there are different arts of
arithmetic applicable to each of these respec
tively.

Others again, who are aware that the simple
system of Logic may be applied to all subjects
whatever, are yet disposed to view it as a pe
culiar method of reasoning, and not, as it is, a
method of unfolding and analyzing our rea

soning: whence many have been led (e. g. the
author of the Philosophy of Rhetoric) to

talk of comparing syllogistic reasoning with
moral reasoning, taking it for granted that it

is possible to reason correctly without reason

ing logically; which is in fact as great a blun
der as if any one were to mistake grammar for
a peculiar language, and to suppose it possible
to speak correctly without speaking gramma
tically. They have in short considered logic

as an art of reasoning; whereas (so far as it is
an art) it is the art of reasoning; the logician's
object being, not to lay down principles by
which one may reason, but by which all must
reason, even though they are not distinctly
aware of them:—to lay down rules, not which

may be followed with advantage, but which
cannot possibly be departed from in sound rea
soning. These misapprehensions and objec
tions being such as lie on the very threshold
of the subject, it would have been hardly pos
sible, without noticing them, to convey any

just notion of the nature and design of the
logical system.
§ 2.

Supposing it then to have been perceived
that the operation of reasoning is in all
cases the same, the analysis of that operation
could not fail to strike the mind as an interest

ing matter of inquiry: and moreover, since

inconclusive, are so often employed either

from error or design; and since even those
who are not misled by these fallacies, are so

often at a loss to detect and expose them in a
manner satisfactory to others, or even to them
selves; it could not but appear desirable to
lay down some general rules of reasoning, ap
plicable to all cases, by which a person might
be enabled the more readily and clearly to
state the grounds of his own conviction,
or of his objection to the arguments of
an opponent; instead of arguing at random,
without any fixed and acknowledged princi
ples to guide his procedure. Such rules
would be analogous to those of Arithmetic,
which obviate the tediousness and uncertainty
of calculations in the head, wherein, after
much labour, different persons might arrive at
different results, without any of them being
able distinctly to point out the error of the

rest. A system of such rules, it is obvious,
must, instead of deserving to be called the art
of wrangling, be more justly characterised as
the “art of cutting short wrangling,” by bring
ing the parties to issue at once, if not to

agreement; and thus saving a waste of in
genuity.

In pursuing the supposed investigation, it ºf
will be found that every conclusion is deduced,
in reality, from two other propositions; (thence

called Premises ;) for though one of these may
be, and commonly is, suppressed, it must
nevertheless be understood as admitted; as

24

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

may easily be made evident by supposing the
denial of the suppressed premiss, which will
at once invalidate the argument: e. g. if any
one from perceiving that “the world exhibits
marks of design,” infers that “it must have had

an intelligent author,” though he may not be
aware in his own mind of the existence of any
other premiss, he will readily understand, if it
be denied that “whatever exhibits marks of

design must have had an intelligent author,”
that the affirmative of that proposition is ne

cessary to the validity of the argument. An
argument thus stated regularly and at full
length, is called a Syllogism; which therefore
is evidently not a peculiar kind of argument,

but only a peculiar form of expression, in which
every argument may be stated.
When one of the premises is suppressed,

(which for brevity's sake it usually is) the ar
gument is called an Enthymeme. And it may
be worth while to remark, that when the argu
ment is in this state, the objections of an
opponent are (or rather appear to be) of two
kinds; viz. either objections to the assertion
itself, or objections to its force as an argument;
e.g. in the above instance, an atheist may be
conceived either denying that the world does
exhibit marks of design, or denying that it
follows from thence that it had an intelligent

author. Now it is important to keep in mind

25

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

that the only difference in the two cases

is, that in the one the expressed premiss is
denied, in the other the suppressed ; for the
jorce as an argument of either premiss depends
on the other premiss: if both be admitted, the

conclusion legitimately connected with them
cannot be denied.

It is evidently immaterial to the argument
whether the conclusion be placed first or last;

but it may be proper to remark, that a premiss
placed after its conclusion is called the Reason

of it, and is introduced by one of those con
junctions which are called causal; viz. “ since,”
“ because,” &c. which may indeed be employed

to designate a premiss, whether it came first or
last. The illative conjunctions, “therefore,”
&c. designate the conclusion.

-

-

It is a circumstance which often occasions
error and perplexity, that both these classes of

conjunctions have also another signification,
being employed to denote, respectively, Cause
and Effect, as well as Premiss and Conclusion :
e.g. If I say (to use an instance employed by
Aristotle) “yonder is a fixed star, because it
twinkles,” or, “it twinkles, and therefore is a
fixed star,” I employ these conjunctions to
denote the connection of premiss and conclusion;
for it is plain that the twinkling of the star is

not the cause of its being fixed, but only the

cause of my knowing that it is so; but if I say,

26

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

“it twinkles because it is a fixed star,” or “it

is a fixed star, and therefore twinkles,” I am
using the same conjunctions to denote the con
... and nection of cause and effect; for in this case the
twinkling of the star, being evident to the eye,
would hardly need to be proved, but might need
to be accounted for. There are, however,

many cases, in which the cause is employed to
prove the existence of its effect; especially in
arguments relating to future events:* the cause
and the reason, in that case, coincide; and this

contributes to their being so often confounded
together in other cases.
§ 3.
In an argument, such as the example above
given, it is, as has been said, impossible for

any one, who admits both premises, to avoid
admitting the conclusion; but there will be

º “frequently an apparent connection of premises
with a conclusion which does not in reality
follow from them, though to the inattentive or
unskilful the argument may appear to be valid:
and there are many other cases in which a

doubt may exist whether the argument be valid
or not; i. e. whether it be possible or not to
admit the premises, and yet deny the conclu
sion. It is of the highest importance, there

fore, to lay down some regular form to which
every valid argument may be reduced, and to

devise a rule which shall show the validity of

every argument in that form, and consequently
the unsoundness of any apparent argument
which cannot be reduced to it:-e.g. if such
an argument as this be proposed, “every ra.
tional agent is accountable; brutes are not ra.
tional agents; therefore they are not account
able:" or again, “all wise legislators suit their
laws to the genius of their nation; Solon did
this; therefore he was a wise legislator:” there

are some, perhaps, who would not perceive
any fallacy in such arguments, especially if en
veloped in a cloud of words; and still more
when the conclusion is true, or (which comes
to the same point) if they are disposed to be

lieve it: and others might perceive indeed, but
might be at a loss to explain the fallacy. Now
these (apparent) arguments exactly correspond,
respectively, with the following, the absurdity
of the conclusions from which is manifest:

“every horse is an animal; sheep are not
horses; therefore they are not animals:” and,
“all vegetables grow; an animal grows; there
fore it is a vegetable.” These last examples,
I have said, correspond exactly (considered as

arguments) with the former; the question
respecting the validity of an argument being,
not whether the conclusion be true, but whe

28

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

ther it follows from the premises adduced.
This mode of exposing a fallacy, by bringing
forward a similar one whose conclusion is ob

viously absurd, is often, and very advan
tageously, resorted to in addressing those who
are ignorant of Logical rules;* but to lay
down such rules, and employ them as a test,

is evidently a safer and more compendious, as
well as a more philosophical mode of proceed
ing. To attain these, it would plainly be ne

cessary to analyze some clear and valid argu
ments, and to observe in what their conclusive
ness consists.

Let us suppose, then, such an examination
to be made of the syllogism above mentioned:
“whatever exhibits marks of design had an
intelligent author; the world exhibits marks
of design; therefore the world had an intelli
gent author.” In the first of these premises
we find it assumed universally of the class of
“things which exhibit marks of design,” that
they had an intelligent author; and in the

which I see no reason against acknowledging) entitled

“Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte;” in
which it was shown that the existence of that extraordi

nary person could not, on Hume's principles, be received
as a well-authenticated fact; since it rests on evidence less

strong than that which supports the Scriptures,

other premiss, “the world" is referred to that
class as comprehended in it: now it is evident,
that whatever is said of the whole of a class,

may be said of any thing comprehended in
that class; so that we are thus authorized to

say of the world, that it had an intelligent
author. Again, if we examine a syllogism
with a negative conclusion, as, e.g. “nothing
which exhibits marks of design could have
been produced by chance: the world exhibits,
&c.; therefore the world could not have been

produced by chance:" the process of Reason
ing will be found to be the same; since it is
evident, that whatever is denied universally of
any class, may be denied of anything that is
comprehended in that class.
On further examination it will be found, that

all valid arguments whatever may be easily re
duced to such a form as that of the foregoing
syllogisms; and that consequently the prin
ciple on which they are constructed is the
UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE of Reasoning.
So elliptical, indeed, is the ordinary mode of

expression, even of those who are considered
as prolix writers, i.e. so much is implied and
left to be understood in the course of argu
ment, in comparison of what is actually stated

(most men being impatient, even to excess, of
any appearance of unnecessary and tedious for
mality of statement), that a single sentence

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

will often be found, though perhaps considered
as a single argument, to contain, compressed
into a short compass, a chain of several distinct
arguments; but if each of these be fully deve
loped, and the whole of what the author in
tended to imply be stated expressly, it will be
found that all the steps even of the longest and
most complex train of reasoning, may be re
duced into the above form.

It is a mistake (which might appear scarcely
worthy of notice, had not so many, even es
teemed writers, fallen into it) to imagine that

Aristotle and other logicians meant to propose
that this prolix form of unfolding arguments
should universally supersede, in argumentative
discourses, the common forms of expression;
and that to reason logically, means, to state
all arguments at full length in the syllogistic
form ; and Aristotle has even been charged

with inconsistency for not doing so; it has
been said, that “in his Treatises of Ethics,
Politics, &c. he argues like a rational creature,
and never attempts to bring his own system
into practice.”* As well might a chemist be

charged with inconsistency for making use of
any of the compound substances that are com
monly employed, without previously analyzing
and resolving them into their simple elements;

as well might it be imagined that, to speak

we utter. The chemist (to pursue the illus

tration) keeps by him his tests and his method
of analysis, to be employed when any substance
is offered to his notice, the composition of
which has not been ascertained, or in which

adulteration is suspected. Now a fallacy may
aptly be compared to some adulterated com

ciples of reasoning: the maxim resulting from
the examination of a syllogism in the fore

every valid argument is in reality an instance,
is, “that whatever is predicated (i. e. affirmed

firmed or denied) of any thing comprehended
in that class.” This is the principle, com

monly called the dictum de omni et nullo, for
the establishment of which we are indebted to

Aristotle, and which is the keystone of his

whole logical system. It is not a little re
markable that some, otherwise judicious wri

ters, should have been so carried away by their
zeal against that philosopher, as to speak with
scorn and ridicule of this principle, on account
of its obviousness and simplicity; though they
would probably perceive at once, in any other
case, that it is the greatest triumph of philoso
phy to refer many, and seemingly very various,
phenomena to one, or a very few, simple prin
ciples; and that the more simple and evident
such a principle is, provided it be truly appli

cable to all the cases in question, the greater is
its value and scientific beauty. If, indeed, any
principle be regarded as not thus applicable,
that is an objection to it of a different kind.
Such an objection against Aristotle's dictum,

no one has ever attempted to establish by any
kind of proof; but it has often been taken for
granted ; it being (as has been stated) very
commonly supposed, without examination, that
the syllogism is a distinct kind of argument, and

that the rules of it accordingly do not apply,
nor were intended to apply, to all reasoning

whatever. Under this misapprehension, Camp

bell” labours, with some ingenuity, and not
without an air of plausibility, to show that
every syllogism must be futile and worthless,

because the premises virtually assert the con
clusion: little dreaming, of course, that his

objections, however specious, lie against the
process of reasoning itself, universally; and will

therefore, of course, apply to those very argu
ments which he is himself adducing.
It is much more extraordinary to find ano

ther authort adopting, expressly, the very
same objections, and yet distinctly admitting
(within a few pages) the possibility of reducing
every course of argument to a series of syl
logisms.
The same writer brings an objection against
the Dictum of Aristotle; which it may be
worth while to notice briefly, for the sake of

setting in a clearer light the real character and
object of that principle. Its application being,
as has been seen, to a regular and conclusive
syllogism, he supposes it intended to prove and
make evident the conclusiveness of such a syl

logism; and remarks how unphilosophical it is
to attempt giving a demonstration of a demon

stration. And certainly the charge would be
just, if we could imagine the logician's object
to be, to increase the certainty of a conclusion

which we are supposed to have already arrived
at by the clearest possible mode of proof. But
it is very strange that such an idea should ever
have occurred to one who had even the slight

est tincture of natural philosophy: for it might
as well be imagined that a natural philosopher's
or a chemist's design is to strengthen the tes

timony of our senses by a priori reasoning, and
to convince us that a stone when thrown will

fall to the ground, and that gunpowder will
explode when fired; because they show that
according to their principles those phenomena
must take place as they do. But it would be
reckoned a mark of the grossest ignorance and
stupidity not to be aware that their object is
not to prove the existence of an individual phe
nomenon, which our eyes have witnessed, but
(as the phrase is) to account for it: i. e. to
show according to what principle it takes place;
—to refer, in short, the individual case to a
general law of nature. The object of Aristo
tle's dictum is precisely analogous: he had,
doubtless, no thought of adding to the force of
any individual syllogism; his design was to
point out the general principle on which that
process is conducted which takes place in each
syllogism. And as the laws of nature (as they
are called) are in reality merely generalized
Jacts, of which all the phenomena coming

under them are particular instances; so the

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

35

proof drawn from Aristotle's Dictum is not a

distinct demonstration brought to confirm
another demonstration, but is merely a gene
ralised and abstract statement of all demonstra

tion whatever; and is, therefore, in fact, the
very demonstration which, (mutatis mutandis)
accommodated to the various subject-matters,
is actually employed in each particular case.

In order to trace more distinctly the differ
ent steps of the abstracting process, by which
any particular argument may be brought into
the most general form, we may first take a
syllogism stated accurately and at full length,
such as the example formerly given, “what
ever exhibits marks of design, &c.," and then
somewhat generalise the expression, by sub
stituting (as in Algebra) arbitrary unmeaning

symbols for the significant terms that were ori
ginally used; the syllogism will then stand
thus; “every B is A : C is B; therefore C is
A.” The reasoning is no less evidently valid
when thus stated, whatever terms A, B, and C,
respectively may be supposed to stand for:
such terms may indeed be inserted as to make

all, or any of, the assertions false ; but it will
still be no less impossible for any one who
admits the truth of the premises, in an argu
ment thus constructed, to deny the conclusion;
and this it is that constitutes the conclusiveness

of an argument.
D 2

36

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

Viewing then the syllogism thus expressed,
it appears clearly, that “A stands for any thing
whatever that is affirmed of a whole class,”

(viz. of every B) “which comprehends or con
tains in it something else,” viz. C (of which B
is, in the second premiss, affirmed); and that,
consequently, the first term (A) is, in the con
clusion, predicated of the third C.
Now to assert the validity of this process,
now before us, is to state the very Dictum we
are treating of, with hardly even a verbal alter
ation; viz.:

1. Anything whatever, predicated of a
whole class,

2. Under which class something else is con
tained,

-

3. May be predicated of that which is so
contained.

The three members into which the maxim is

here distributed, correspond to the three pro
positions of the syllogism to which they are
intended respectively to apply.
The advantage of substituting for the terms,
in a regular syllogism, arbitrary unmeaning
symbols, such as letters of the alphabet, is
much the same as in mathematics: the reason

ing itself is then considered, by itself, clearly,
and without any risk of our being misled by
the truth or falsity of the conclusion; which
is, in fact, accidental and variable ; the essen

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

37

tial point being, as far as the argument is con
cerned, the connexion between the premises and
the

conclusion.

We are thus enabled to

embrace the general principle of all reasoning,
and to perceive its applicability to an indefinite
number of individual cases.

That Aristotle,

therefore, should have been accused of making
use of these symbols for the purpose of dark
ening his demonstrations, and that too by per
sons not unacquainted with geometry and
algebra, is truly astonishing. If a geometer,
instead of designating the four angles of a
square by four letters, were to call them north,
south, east, and west, he would not render the
demonstration of a theorem the easier; and the

learner would be much more likely to be per
plexed in the application of it.
It belongs then exclusively to a syllogism,
properly so called (i. e. a valid argument, so
stated that its conclusiveness is evident from

the mere form of the expression), that if letters,
or any other unmeaning symbols, be substi
tuted for the several terms, the validity of the

argument shall still be evident. Whenever
this is not the case, the supposed argument is
either unsound and sophistical, or else may be
reduced (without any alteration of its mean
ing) into the syllogistic form; in which

form, the test just mentioned may be applied
to it.

-

38

guments.

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

What is called an unsound or fallacious ar

ar

gument, i. e. an apparent argument which is,
in reality, none, cannot, of course, be reduced
into this form; but when stated in the form

most nearly approaching to this that is possi
ble, its fallaciousness becomes more evident,
from its nonconformity to the foregoing rule :
e.g. “whoever is capable of deliberate crime

is responsible; an infant is not capable of de
liberate crime; therefore, an infant is not
responsible:” here the term “responsible” is

affirmed universally of “those capable of deli
berate crime;" it might, therefore, according
to Aristotle's Dictum, have been affirmed of

anything contained under that class; but in the
instance before us nothing is mentioned as

contained under that class; only, the term
“infant” is excluded from that class ; and

though what is affirmed of a whole class may
be affirmed of anything that is contained un
der it, there is no ground for supposing that it
may be denied of whatever is not so contained;

for it is evidently possible that it may be appli
cable to a whole class and to something else
besides: to say, e. g. that all trees are vegeta
bles, does not imply that nothing else is a vege
table.

Nor, when it is said, that all who are

capable of deliberate crime are responsible, does
this imply, that no others are responsible; for
though this may be very true, it has not been

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

. 39

asserted in the premiss before us; and in the
analysis of an argument, we are to discard all
consideration of what might be asserted; con
templating only what actually is laid down in
the premises. It is evident, therefore, that
such an apparent argument as the above does
not comply with the rule laid down, nor can
be so stated as to comply with it, and is con
sequently invalid.

Again, in this instance, “food is necessary
to life; corn is food; therefore, corn is neces

sary to life:” the term “necessary to life” is
affirmed of food, but not universally; for it is
not said of every kind of food: the meaning of
the assertion being manifestly that some food
is necessary to life: here again, therefore, the
rule has not been complied with, since that
which has been predicated, (i. e. affirmed or
denied) not of the whole, but of a part only of
a certain class, cannot be, on that ground, pre
dicated of anything whatever which is con
tained under that class.

§ 5.
The fallacy in this last case is, what is
usually described in logical language as con
sisting in the “non-distribution of the middle
term:” i. e. its not being employed to denote

all the objects to which it is applicable. In
order to understand this phrase, it is necessary

40

to observe, that a proposition being an expres
sion in which one thing is affirmed or denied

of another; e.g. “A is B,” both that of which
something is said, and that, which is said of it
(i.e. both A and B), are called “terms,” from
their being (in their nature) the extremes or
boundaries of the proposition; and there are,
of course, two, and but two, terms in a propo
sition (though it may so happen that either of
them may consist either of one word, or of
several); and a term is said to be “ distri
buted,” when it is taken universally, so as to
stand for everything it is capable of being
applied to ; and consequently “undistributed,”
when it stands for a portion only of the things

signified by it: thus, “all food,” or every kind
of food, are expressions which imply the dis
tribution of the term “food;” “ some food”

would imply its non-distribution: and it is also
to be observed, that the term of which, in one

premiss, something is affirmed or denied, and

to which, in the other premiss, something else
is referred as contained in it, is called the

“middle" term in the syllogism, as standing
between the other two (viz. the two terms of

the conclusion), and being the medium of
proof. Now it is plain, that if in each premiss
a part only of this middle term is employed,

i. e. if it be not at all distributed, no conclu
sion can be drawn.

Hence, if, in the example

41

formerly adduced, it had been merely stated
that “something” (not “whatever,” or “every
thing") “which exhibits marks of design, is the
work of an intelligent author,” it would not
have followed, from the world's exhibiting
marks of design, that that is the work of an
intelligent author.
It is to be observed, also, that the words
“all” and “every,” which mark the distribu
tion of a term, and “ some,” which marks its

non-distribution, are not always expressed:
they are frequently understood, and left to be
supplied by the context; e.g. “food is neces
sary:” viz. “ some food;” “man is mortal;”
viz. “ every man.” Propositions thus ex
pressed are called by logicians “indefinite,” be
cause it is left undetermined by the form of the
expression whether the “subject” (the term
of which something is affirmed or denied being
called the “subject” of the proposition, and
that which is said of it, the “predicate") be
distributed or not. Nevertheless it is plain
that in every proposition the subject either is,
or is not, distributed, though it be not declared
whether it is or not; consequently, every pro

position, whether expressed indefinitely or not,
must be either “universal” or “particular;”

those being called universal, in which the pre
dicate is said of the whole of the subject (or,

in other words, where the subject is distri

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

buted); and those particular, in which it is
said only of a part of the subject: e.g. “All
men are sinful,” is universal; “ some men are

sinful,” particular: and this division of propo
sitions is, in logical language, said to be accord
ing to their “quantity.”

ºn But the distribution or

non-distribution of

* the predicate is entirely independent of the
quantity of the proposition; nor are the signs
“all” and “ some” ever affixed to the predi
cate; because its distribution depends upon,
and is indicated by, the “quality” of the pro
position; i.e. its being affirmative or negative :
it being a universal rule, that the predicate of
a negative proposition is distributed, and of an
affirmative, undistributed. *

The reason of

that a term which stands for a whole class may

the predicate of an affirmative is never distributed; espe
cially as Aldrich has admitted that accidentally this may
take place ; as in such a proposition as “all equilateral
triangles are equiangular;” but this is not accurate; he
might have said that in such a proposition as the above the
predicate is distributable, but not that it is actually distri

buted: i. e. it so happens that “all equiangular triangles
are equilateral;” but this is not implied in the previous as
sertion; and the point to be considered is, not what might
be said with truth, but what actually has been said.

much narrower extent than that other, and
may, therefore, be far from coinciding with the
whole of it: thus it may be said with truth,
that “the Negroes are uncivilized,” though the
term uncivilized be of much wider extent than

“Negroes,” comprehending, besides them, Hot
tentots, &c.; so that it would not be allowable
to assert, that “all who are uncivilized are

Negroes;" it is evident, therefore, that it is a
part only of the term “uncivilized” that has
been affirmed of “Negroes:” and the same

reasoning applies to every affirmative proposi
tion; for though it may so happen that the
subject and predicate coincide, i. e. are of equal
extent, as, e.g. “all men are rational ani

mals;” “all equilateral triangles are equiangu
lar;” (it being equally true, that “all rational
animals are men, and that all equiangular tri

angles are equilateral); yet this is not implied
by the form of the expression; since it would be
no less true, that “all men are rational ani
mals,” even if there were other rational animals
besides man.

It is plain, therefore, that if any part of the
predicate is applicable to the subject, it may be
affirmed, and, of course, cannot be denied, of
that subject; and consequently, when the pre
dicate is denied of the subject, it is implied that

no part of that predicate is applicable to that

44

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

subject; i. e. that the whole of the predicate is
denied of the subject: for to say, e.g. that “no

beasts of prey ruminate,” implies that beasts of
prey are excluded from the whole class of ru
minant animals, and consequently that “no
ruminant animals are beasts of prey.” And
hence results the above-mentioned rule, that

the distribution of the predicate is implied in

negative propositions, and its non-distribution
in affirmatives.

It is to be remembered, therefore, that it is
not sufficient for the middle term to occur in a

universal proposition; since if that proposition
be an affirmative, and the middle term be the
predicate of it, it will not be distributed : e. g.
if in the example formerly given it had been

merely asserted, that “all the works of an intel
ligent author shew marks of design,” and that
“the universe shews marks of design,” nothing
could have been proved; since, though both
these propositions are universal, the middle

term is made the predicate in each, and both
are affirmative; and accordingly, the rule of
Aristotle is not here complied with, since the
term “work of an intelligent author,” which is
to be proved applicable to “the universe,”
would not have been affirmed of the middle

term (“what shows marks of design"), under
which “universe” is contained; but the middle

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

45

term, on the contrary, would have been affirmed
of it.

If, however, one of the premises be nega
tive, the middle term may then be made the
predicate of that, and will thus, according to
the above remark, be distributed: e.g. “ no
ruminant animals are predacious; the lion is
predacious ; therefore the lion is not rumi
nant:" this is a valid syllogism; and the mid

dle term (predacious) is distributed by being
made the predicate of a negative proposition.
The form, indeed, of the syllogism is not that
prescribed by the dictum of Aristotle, but it
may easily be reduced to that form, by stating
the first proposition thus: “no predacious ani
mals are ruminant;" which is manifestly im
plied (as was above remarked) in the assertion
that “no ruminant animals are predacious.”
The syllogism will thus appear in the form to
which the dictum applies.
It is not every argument, indeed, that can
be reduced to this form by so short and simple

an alteration as in the case before us: a longer
and more complex process will often be re

quired; and rules will hereafter be laid down
to facilitate this process in certain cases: but
there is no sound argument but what can be
reduced into this form, without at all departing

from the real meaning and drift of it; and the
form will be found (though more prolix than

46

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

is needed for ordinary use) the most perspi
cuous in which an argument can be ex
hibited.

All reasoning whatever, then, rests on the
one simple principle laid down by Aristotle,
that “what is predicated, either affirmatively
or negatively, of a term distributed, may be
predicated in like manner (i.e. affirmatively or
negatively) of anything contained under that
term.” So that when our object is to prove

any proposition, i. e. to shew that one term
may rightly be affirmed or denied of another,
the process which really takes place in our

minds is, that we refer that term (of which the
other is to be thus predicated) to some class
(i. e. middle term) of which that other may be
affirmed, or denied, as the case may be.
Whatever the subject matter of an argument
may be, the reasoning itself, considered by it
self, is in every case the same process; and if

the writers against logic had kept this in mind,
they would have been cautious of expressing

their contempt of what they call “syllogistic

reasoning,” which is in truth all reasoning;
and instead of ridiculing Aristotle's principle
for its obviousness and simplicity, would have
º.

perceived that these are, in fact, its highest
praise: the easiest, shortest, and most evident

theory, provided it answer the purpose of ex
planation, being ever the best.

§ 6.

If we conceive an inquirer to have reached,
in his investigation of the theory of rea
soning, the point to which we have now
arrived, a question which would be likely next
to engage his attention, is that of predication ;
i.e. since in reasoning we are to find a middle

term, which may be predicated affirmatively of
the subject in question, we are led to inquire
what terms may be affirmed, and what denied,
of what others.

-

It is evident that proper names, or any other tº a
terms, which denote each but a single indivi-".
dual, as “Caesar,” “ the Thames,” “the Con
queror of Pompey,” “this river” (hence called
in logic “singular terms”) cannot be affirmed
of anything besides themselves, and are there

fore to be denied of anything else; we may
say, “this river is the Thames,” or “Caesar

was the conqueror of Pompey;” but we can
not say of anything else that it is

the

Thames.

On the other hand, those terms which are

called “ common,” as denoting any one indivi
dual of a whole class, as “river,” “conqueror,”
may of course be affirmed of any, or all that

belong to that class: as, “the Thames is a
river;” “ the Rhine and the Danube are
rivers.”

Common terms, therefore, are called “pre

48

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

dicables” (viz. affirmatively predicable), from
their capability of being affirmed of others: a

singular term, on the contrary, may be the Sub
ject of a proposition, but never the Predicate,
unless it be of a negative proposition; (as e. g.
the first-born of Isaac was not Jacob ;) or, un
less the subject and predicate be only two ex
pressions for the same individual object; as in
some of the above instances.
Abstraction

and generali
zation.

The process by which the mind arrives at
the notions expressed by these “common" (or
in popular language, “ general") terms, is

properly called Generalization ; though it is
usually (and truly) said to be the business of
abstraction ; for Generalization is one of the

purposes to which Abstraction is applied: when
we draw off, and contemplate separately, any part

of an object presented to the mind, disregard
ing the rest of it, we are said to abstract that
part. Thus, a person might, when a rose was
before his eyes or mind, make the scent a
distinct object of attention, laying aside all
thought of the colour, form, &c.; and thus,
even though it were the only rose he had ever
met with, he would be employing the faculty
of Abstraction; but if, in contemplating seve

ral objects, and finding that they agree in
certain points, we abstract the circumstances of

agreement, disregarding the differences, and
give to all and each of these objects a name

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

49

applicable to them in respect of this agreement,
i. e. a common name (as “ rose,”) we are
then said to generalize. Abstraction, there

fore, does not necessarily imply Generalization,
though Generalization implies Abstraction.
Much needless difficulty has been raised re

specting the results of this process; many
having contended, and perhaps more having
taken for granted, that there must be some
really existing thing,” corresponding to each
of these general or common terms, and of
which such term is the name, standing for and
representing it; e.g. that as there is a really
existing Being corresponding to the proper
name, AEtna, and signified by it, so the common
term “mountain,” must have some one really ex
isting thing corresponding to it, and of course
distinct from each individual mountain, (since
the term is not singular, but common,) yet

existing in each, since the term is applicable to
each of them. “When many different men,”
it is said, “are at the same time thinking or

speaking about a mountain, i. e. not any par
ticular one, but a mountain generally, their
minds must be all employed on something ;
which must also be one thing, and not several,

and yet cannot be any one individual:” and
hence a vast train of mystical disquisitions
about Ideas, &c. has arisen, which are at best

nugatory, and tend to obscure our view of
the process which actually takes place in the
mind.

The fact is, the notion expressed by a com
mon term is merely an inadequate (or incom

plete) notion of an individual; and from the
very circumstance of its inadequacy, it will

apply equally well to any one of several indivi
duals: e. g. if I omit the mention and the
consideration of every circumstance which dis
tinguishes AEtna from any other mountain, I
then form a notion (expressed by the common
term mountain) which inadequately designates
AEtna, (i.e. which does not imply any of its
peculiarities,) and is equally applicable to any
one of several other individuals.

Generalization, it is plain, may be indefi
nitely extended by a further abstraction ap
plied to common terms : e.g. as by abstraction
from the term Socrates we obtain the common

term “Philosopher;” so from “philosopher,” by
a similar process, we arrive at the more general
term “man;” from “man” we advance to
“ animal,” &c.

The employment of this faculty at pleasure
has been regarded, and perhaps with good rea
son, as the characteristic distinction of the
human mind from that of the Brutes.

We

are thus enabled, not only to separate, and con
sider singly, one part of an object presented to

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

51

the mind, but also to fix arbitrarily upon what
ever part we please, according as may suit the
purpose we happen to have in view: e.g. any

individual person to whom we may direct our
attention, may be considered either in a politi

cal point of view, and accordingly referred to
the class of Merchant, Farmer, Lawyer, &c. as
the case may be; or physiologically, as Negro,
or White-man; or theologically, as Pagan or
Christian, Papist or Protestant; or geographi
cally, as European, American, &c. &c. And
so, in respect of anything else that may be the
subject of our reasoning: we arbitrarily fix
upon and abstract that point which is essential
to the purpose in hand; so that the same ob
ject may be referred to various different classes,
according to the occasion. Not, of course,

that we are allowed to refer anything to a class
to which it does not really belong; which
would be pretending to abstract from it some
thing that was no part of it; but that we ar

bitrarily fix on any part of it which we choose
to abstract from the rest. It is important to
notice this, because men are often disposed to

consider each object as really and properly be
longing to some one class alone,” from their
having been accustomed, in the course of
their own pursuits, to consider, in one point of

view only, things which may with equal pro
priety be considered in other points of view
also: i.e. referred to various Classes, (or pre
dicates.) And this is that which chiefly con
stitutes what is called narrowness of mind:

e.g. a mere botanist might be astonished at
hearing such plants as Clover and Lucerne in
cluded, in the language of a farmer, under the

term “grasses,” which he has been accustomed
to limit to a tribe of plants widely different in all
botanical characteristics; and the mere farmer

might be no less surprised to find the trouble

:* some “weed,” (as he has been

accustomed to

call it,) known by the name of couch grass,
and which he has been used to class with

nettles and thistles, to which it has no botanical

affinity, ranked by the botanist as a species of

Wheat, (Triticum Repens.) And yet neither of
these classifications is in itself erroneous or
irrational; though it would be absurd in a bo

tanical treatise to class plants according to
their agricultural use; or in an agricultural
treatise, according to the structure of their
flowers.

The utility of these considerations, with a

view to the present subject, will be readily
estimated, by recurring to the account which
has been already given of the process of rea
soning; the analysis of which shews, that it

consists in referring the term we are speaking

ANALYTICAL OUTLINE.

53

of to some class, viz. a middle term; which

term again is referred to or excluded from (as
the case may be) another class, viz. the term

which we wish to affirm or deny of the subject
of the conclusion. So that the quality of our
reasoning in any case must depend in our being
able, correctly, clearly, and promptly, to ab–
stract from the subject in question that which
may furnish a Middle-term suitable to the
occasion.

The imperfect and irregular sketch which
has here been attempted, of the logical system,
may suffice (even though some parts of it
should not be at once fully understood by
those who are entirely strangers to the study)
to point out the general drift and purpose of
the science, and to render the details of it both

more interesting and more intelligible. The
analytical form, which has here been adopted,
is, generally speaking, the best suited for intro
ducing any science in the plainest and most
interesting form; though the synthetical,
which will henceforth be employed, is the most
regular, and the most compendious form for
storing it up in the memory.

that there are, in all, three operations of the mind: (in

and which, if admitted, is nothing to the present purpose:
our business is with argumentation, and the operations of

the mind implied in that; what others there may be, or
whether any, are irrelevant questions.

The opening of a treatise with a statement respecting
the operations of the mind universally, tends to foster the
prevailing error (from which probably the minds of the wri

to teach “the use of the mental faculties in general:”—the
“right use of reason,” according to Watts.

for the purpose of reasoning, (i. e. in order to

liable to be indistinct, (i. e. without any clear,

determinate meaning,) propositions, to be false,
and arguments, inconclusive, Logic undertakes
directly and completely to guard against this
last defect, and, incidentally and in a certain

degree, against the others, as far as can be done
by the proper use of language: it is, therefore,
(when regarded as an arth) “the Art of em
* In introducing the mention of language previously to
the definition of logic, I have departed from established
practice, in order that it may be clearly understood,
that logic is entirely conversant about language: a truth
which most writers on the subject, if indeed they were

fully aware of it themselves, have certainly not taken due
care to impress on their readers.

Aldrich's definition of

Logic, for instance, does not give any hint of this.
t It is to be observed, however, that as a science is con

versant about knowledge only, an art is the application of
knowledge to practice: hence Logic (as well as any other
system of knowledge) becomes, when applied to practice,
an art; while confined to the theory of reasoning, it is
strictly a science: and it is as such that it occupies the
higher place in point of dignity, since it professes to deve
lope some of the most interesting and curious intellectual

phenomena. It is surely strange, therefore, to find in a

estimate who has not long and attentively con
sidered how much our thoughts are influenced
by expressions, and how much error, perplexity,
and labour are occasioned by a faulty use of
language.
A syllogism being, as aforesaid, resolvable
into three propositions, and each proposition
containing two terms; of these terms, that
which is spoken of is called the subject ; that
which is said of it, the predicate; and these
two are called the terms (or extremes) because,
logically, the Subject is placed first, and the
Predicate last: and, in the middle, the Copula,
which indicates the act of judgment, as by it
the Predicate is affirmed or denied of the Sub

ject. It must be either is or Is Not ; the sub
stantive verb being the only verb recognised
by logic: all others are resolvable, by means

of the verb, “to be,” and a participle or adjec

* It is proper to observe, that the copula, as such, has

no relation to time; but expresses merely the agreement or
disagreement of two given terms: hence, if any other
tense of the substantive verb, besides the present, is used,
it is either to be understood as the same in sense, (the dif

58

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

§. 3.
It is evident, that a Term may consist either
of one Word or of several; and that it is not

every word that is capable of being employed

by itself as a Term; e.g. Adverbs, Prepositions,
&c. and also Nouns in any other case besides
the nominative. A Noun may be by itself a
term ; a Verb (all except the substantive verb
used as the copula) is resolvable into the Co

pula and Predicate, to which it is equivalent;
and, indeed, is often so resolved in the mere

rendering out of one language into another;
as “ipse adest,” “he is present.” It is to be
observed, however, that under “verb," we do

not include the Infinitive, which is properly a
Noun-substantive, nor the Participle, which is
a Noun-adjective. They are verbals; being re
lated to their respective verbs in respect of the

things they signify, but not verbs, inasmuch as
they differ entirely in their mode of signification.
It is worth observing, that an Infinitive (though
it often comes last in the sentence) is never the
ference of tense being regarded as a matter of grammatical
convenience only ;) or else, if the circumstance of time
really do modify the sense of the whole proposition, so as
to make the use of that tense an essential, then, this cir

cumstance is to be regarded as a part of one of the terms:
“at that time,” or some such expression, being under
stood. Sometimes the substantive verb is both copula and
predicate; i. e. where existence only is predicated: e. g.
Deus est.

59

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

predicate, except when another Infinitive is the
Subject: e.g.
sub.

pred.

“I hope to succeed:” i.e. “to succeed is what I hope.”

It is to be observed, also, that in English
there are two infinitives, one in “ing,” the
same in sound and spelling-as the participle
present, from which, however, it should be care
fully distinguished; e.g. “rising early is health

ful,” and “it is healthful to rise early,” are
equivalent. In this, and in many other cases,
the English word IT serves as a representative
of the subject when that is put last: e. g.
pred.

sub.

“It is to be hoped that we shall succeed.”

An adjective (including participles) cannot,
by itself, be made the subject of a proposition;
but is often employed as a predicate ; as
“Crassus was rich;” though some choose to
consider some substantive as understood in

every such case, (e.g. rich man) and conse

quently do not reckon adjectives among Simple
terms; (i. e. words which are capable, singly,

of being employed as terms.) This, however,
is a question of no practical consequence.
* Grammarians have

produced much needless perplexity

by speaking of the participle in “ing” being employed so
and so ; when it is manifest that that very employment of
the word constitutes it, to all intents and purposes, an
infinitive and not a participle.

terms.

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

Of Simple-terms, then, (which are what the
first part of logic treats of) there are many di
visions;* of which, however, one will be suffi

cient for the present purpose; viz. into singu
lar and common; because, though any term
whatever may be a subject, none but a common

term can be affirmatively predicated of several

is plain, cannot be said [or predicated] affirma
tively, of any thing but themselves.) A com
mon term stands for several individuals: i. e.

can be applied to any of them, as comprehend
ing them in its single signification; as “man,”
“river,” “great."+. The notions expressed by
these common terms, we are enabled to form,
by the faculty of abstraction: for by it, in con
templating any object (or objects,) we can
attend exclusively to some particular circum

stances belonging to it, [some certain parts of

its nature as it were, and quite withhold our
* The usual divisions of words, however, into univocal,
equivocal, and analogous, and into words of the first and

second intention, are not, strictly speaking, divisions of
words, but divisions of the manner of employing them; the
same word may be employed either univocally, equivocally,
or analogously; either in the first intention or in the se

are thus contemplating several individuals
which resemble each other in some part of their

and not to those points in which they differ)

one of them.

Generalization (as has been remarked) im

plies abstraction, but it is not the same thing;
for there may be abstraction without generali
zation: when we are speaking of an Individual,
it is usually an abstract notion that we form;
e.g. suppose we are speaking of the present
King of France; he must actually be either at
Paris or elsewhere; sitting, standing, or in
some other posture; and in such and such a
dress, &c. Yet many of these circumstances,
(which are separable Accidents (vide §. 7.) and
consequently) which are regarded as non-essen

tial to the individual, are quite disregarded by
us; and we abstract from them what we con

sider as essential; thus forming an abstract

no generalization.

It is evident from what has been said, that

the Genus and Difference put together make up
the Species: e.g. “rational” and “animal"
constitute “man;" so that, in reality, the Spe
cies contains the Genus; (i. e. implies it;) and
when the Genus is called a whole, and is said
to contain the Species, this is only a metaphort
cal expression, signifying that it comprehends
the Species, in its own more extensive significa
tion: e. g. if I predicate of Caesar that he is an
animal, I say the truth indeed, but not the whole

truth; for he is not only an animal, but a man;
so that “man” is a more full and complete ex

pression than “animal;” which for the same
reason is more extensive, as it contains, (or
usually reckoned such by logical writers. They have also
added a fourth kind of property; viz. that which is pecu
liar to a species, and belongs to every individual of it, but
not at every time. But this is in fact a contradiction; since
whatever does not always belong to a species, does not
belong to it universally. It is through the ambiguity of
words that they have fallen into this confusion of thought;
e.g. the example commonly given is, “homini canescere,”
“to become grey” being, they say, (though it is not) pecu
liar to man, and belonging to every individual, though not
always, but only in old age, &c. Now, if by “canescere” be
meant the very circumstance of becoming grey, this mani
festly does not belong to every man: if again it be meant
to signify the liability to become grey hereafter, this does
belong always to man. And the same in other instances.
Indeed the very proprium fixed on by Aldrich, “risibility,”
is nearly parallel to the above. Man is always “capable

of laughing;” but he is not “capable of laughing
always.”

several other species, viz. “beast,” “bird,” &c.
In the same manner the name of a species is a
more extensive, but less full and complete term
than that of an individual (viz. a singular term;)
since the species may be predicated of each of
these. [Note, that genus and species are com

§. 5.
A genus, which is also a species, is called a
subaltern genus or species; as “bird,” which is
the genus of “pigeon” (i.e. of which “pigeon”
is a species) is itself a species of “animal.” A
genus which is not considered as a species of
anything, is called summum (the highest) genus;

a species which is not considered as a genus of
anything, i. e. is regarded as containing under

it only individuals, is called infima (the lowest)
species.
When I say of a Magnet, that it is “a kind

of iron-ore,” that is called its proximum genus,
because it is the closest (or lowest) genus that
can be predicated of it: “mineral” is its more
remote genus.

When I say that the Differentia of a magnet
is its “attracting iron,” and that its Property is
“polarity,” these are called respectively a Spe
cific Difference and Property; because magnet
is an infima species (i.e. only a species.)

• 2

When I say that the Differentia of iron ore is
its “containing iron,” and its property “being
attracted by the magnet,” these are called re
spectively, a generic Difference and Property,

because iron ore is a subaltern species or genus,
being both the genus of magnet, and a species of
mineral.

That is the most strictly called a Property,
which belongs to the whole of a Species, and to

that Species alone; as polarity to the magnet.
[And such a properly it is often hard to distin
guish from the differentia ; but whatever you
consider as the most essential to the nature of a

Species, with respect to the matter you are en
gaged in, you must call the differentia; as “ra

tionality” to “man;" and whatever you consi
der as rather an accompaniment (or result) of

that difference, you must call the property; as
the “use of speech” seems to be a result of
rationality..] But very many properties which
belong to the whole of a species are not pecu
liar to it; as, “to breathe air” belongs to every
man, but not to man alone; and it is, therefore,

strictly speaking, not so much a property of
the Species “man,” as of the higher, i. e. more

comprehensive, Species, which is the genus of
that, viz. of “land-animal.” Other Properties,

as some logicians call them, are peculiar to a
species, but do not belong to the whole of it:
e.g. man alone can be a poet, but it is not every
man that is so.

These, however, are more

commonly and more properly reckoned as
accidents.
Accidents se

parable and
inseparable.

For that is most properly called an Accident,
which may be absent or present, the essence of
the Species continuing the same; as, for a man
to be “walking,” or a “native of Paris -" of
these two examples, the former is what logi
cians call a separable Accident, because it may
be separated from the individual: (e.g. he may
sit down;) the latter is an inseparable Accident,
being not separable from the individual, (i. e.
he who is a native of Paris can never be other

wise;) “from the individual,” I say, because
every accident must be separable from the spe

cies, else it would be a properly.*
* This seems to me a clearer and more correct descrip

tion of the two kinds of accident than the one given by
Aldrich; viz. that a Separable Accident may be actually
separated, and an Inseparable, only in thought, “ut Mantu
anum esse, a Virgilio.” For surely “to be the author of
the AEneid” was another Inseparable Accident of the same
individual; “to be a Roman citizen” another; and “to

live in the days of Augustus” another: now can we in
thought separate all these things from the essence of that
individual? To do so would be to form the idea of a different
individual. We can indeed conceive a man, and one who

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

67

Let it here be observed, that both the gene
ral name “Predicable,” and each of the classes

of Predicables, (viz. Genus, Species, &c.) are

relative; i. e. we cannot say what predicable any
term is, or whether it is any at all, unless it be
specified of what it is to be predicated: e. g.
the term “red” would be considered a genus,
in relation to the terms “pink,” “scarlet,” &c.
it might be regarded as the differentia, in rela
tion to “red rose;”—as a property of “blood,”
-as an accident of “a house,” &c.
And universally, it is to be steadily kept in
mind; that no “common terms” have, as the

names of individuals have, any real thing exist

ing in nature corresponding to them (rºs r, as
Aristotle expresses it, though he has been re
presented as the champion of the opposite opi

nion: vide Categ. c. 3.), but that each of them
is merely a name denoting a certain inadequate
motion which our minds have formed of an In

dividual, and which, consequently, not includ
ing anything wherein that individual differs

from certain others, is applicable equally well

to all or any of them: thus “man” denotes no
real thing (as the sect of the Realists main
tained) distinct from each individual, but

merely any man, viewed inadequately, i.e. so
might chance to bear the name of Virgil, without any of
these Accidents; but then it would plainly not be the same
man.

as to omit, and abstract from, all that is pecu
liar to each individual; by which means the
term becomes applicable alike to any one of
several individuals, or (in the plural) to several
together; and we arbitrarily fix on the circum
stance which we thus choose to abstract and

consider separately, disregarding all the rest;
so that the same individual may thus be re
ferred to any of several different Species, and
the same Species to several Genera, as suits our
purpose. Thus it suits the Farmer's purpose

to class his cattle with his ploughs, carts, and
other possessions, under the name of “stock :”
the Naturalist, suitably to his purpose, classes
them as “quadrupeds,” which term would in
clude wolves, deer, &c., which to the farmer

would be a most improper classification: the
commissary, again, would class them with corn,
cheese, fish, &c. as “provision.” That which
is most essential in one view, being subordi
mate in another.

§. 6.
Division.

An individual is so called because it is inca

pable of logical division; which is a metapho
rical expression to signify “the distinct (i. e.
separate) enumeration of several things signi

fied by one common name.” This operation
is directly opposite to generalization, (which is
performed by means of abstraction;) for as in

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

69

that you lay aside the differences by which se
veral things are distinguished, so as to call
them all by one common name, so, in Division,
you add on the Differences, so as to enumerate
them by their several particular names. Thus,
“mineral” is said to be divided into “stones,

metals,” &c.; and metals again into “gold,
iron,” &c. and these are called the Parts (or
Members) of the division.
The rules for Division are three : 1st. each

of the Parts, or any of them short of all, must
contain less (i.e. have a narrower signification)
than the thing divided. 2d. All the Parts to

gether must be exactly equal to the thing di
vided; (therefore we must be careful to ascer
tain that the summum genus may be predicated
of every term placed under it, and of nothing
else.) 3d. The Parts or Members must be op
posed ; i. e. must not be contained in one

another: e. g. if you were to divide “book”
into “poetical, historical, folio, quarto, French,
Latin,” &c. the members would be contained

in each other; for a French book may be a
quarto, and a quarto French, &c. You must
be careful, therefore, to keep in mind the prin
ciple of division with which you set out : e. g.
whether you begin dividing books according
to their matter, their language, or their size,

&c. all these being so many cross-divisions.
And when anything is capable (as in the

70

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

above instance) of being divided in several dif
ferent ways, we are not to reckon one of these
as the true, or real, or right one, without spe

cifying what the object is which we have in
view: for one mode of dividing may be the
most suitable for one purpose, and another
for another; as e. g. one of the above modes
of dividing books would be the most suitable
to a bookbinder; another in a philosophical,
and the other in a philological view.

It must be carefully remembered, that the
word “Division,” as employed in Logic, is, as
has been observed already, metaphorical; for
to divide, means, originally and properly, to se
parate the component parts of anything; each
of which is of course absolutely less than the

whole: e. g. a tree (i. e. any individual tree)
might be divided “physically,” as it is called,
into root, trunk, branches, leaves, &c.

Now

it cannot be said that a root or a leaf is a tree :

whereas in a Logical Division each of the Mem

bers is, in reality, more than the whole : e. g.
if you divide tree (i. e. the genus, tree) into
oak, elm, ash, &c. we may say of the oak, or
of any individual oak, that “it is a tree;” for

by the very word “oak,” we express not only
the general notion of a tree, but more, viz. the

peculiar characteristic (i. e. Difference) of that
kind of tree.

It is plain, then, that it is logically only, i. e.

.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

7t

in our mode of speaking, that a genus is said
to contain (or rather, comprehend) its species;
while metaphysically, i. e. in our conceptions,
a species contains, i. e. implies, its genus.
Care must be taken not to confound a phy
sical division with a logical; against which a

caution is given under Rule 1, p. 69.
§. 7.
Definition is another metaphorical word, Definition.
which literally signifies, “laying down a boun
dary ;” and is used in logic to signify “an ex
pression which explains any term, so as to .

separate it from everything else,” as a boundary
separates fields.

A Nominal Definition (such

as are those usually found in a dictionary of
one's own language) explains only the meaning
of the term, by giving some equivalent expres
sion, which may happen to be better known.
Thus you might define a “Term,” that which
forms one of the extremes or boundaries of a

“proposition;” and a “Predicable,” that which

may be predicated; “decalogue,” “ten com
mandments;” “telescope,” an instrument for

viewing distant objects, &c. A Real Definition
is one which explains and unfolds the nature

of the thing ; and each of these kinds of defini
tion is either accidental or essential.

An essen

tial Definition assigns (or lays down) the con
stituent parts of the essence (or nature.) An

72

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

accidental Definition (which is commonly called

a description) assigns the circumstances belong
ing to the essence, viz. Properties and Accidents
(e.g. causes, effects, &c.) thus, “man” may be
described as “an animal that uses fire to dress

*...
sions of defi his food,” &c. [And here note, that in describ
nition.
ing a species, you cannot mention anything
which is strictly an accident, because if it does
not belong to the whole of the Species, it can
not define it: in describing an individual, on
the contrary, you enumerate the accidents, be
cause by them it is that one individual differs
from another, and in this case you add the spe
cies : e.g. “Philip was a man of Macedon,
who subdued Greece,” &c. Individuals, it is

evident, can be defined in this way alone.]
Lastly, the Essential Definition is divided into

physical (i. e. natural) and logical or metaphysi
cal: the physical Definition lays down the real

parts of the essence which are actually sepa
rable; the logical, lays down the ideal parts of
it, which cannot be separated except in the
mind: thus, a plant would be defined physi
cally, by enumerating the leaves, stalks, roots,

&c. of which it is composed: logically, it
would be defined “an organized Being, destitute
of sensation;" the former of these expressions
denoting the Genus, the latter the Difference;

for a logical definition must always consist of
the genus and differentia, which are the parts of

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

73

which Logic considers everything as consisting,
and which evidently are separable in the mind
alone.

Thus “man” is defined “a rational

animal,” &c. So also a “Proposition” might
be defined, physically, “a subject and predicate
combined by a copula:” the parts here enume

rated being actually separable; but logically it
would be defined “a sentence which affirms or

denies;” and these two parts of the essence

of a Proposition (which are the genus and dif.
ferentia of it) can be separated in the mind only.
And note, that the Difference is not always one
quality, but is frequently compounded of several
together, no one of which would alone suffice.
Definitions are divided into Nominal and

Real, according to the object accomplished by
them; whether to explain, merely, the mean
ing of the word, or the nature of the thing: on
the other hand, they are divided into Acci
dental, Physical, and Logical, according to the

means employed by each for accomplishing their
respective objects; whether it be the enume
ration of attributes, or of the physical, or the
metaphysical parts of the essence. These,

therefore, are evidently two cross-divisions.
In this place we are concerned with nominal

definitions only (except, indeed, of logical
terms”) because all that is requisite for the
* The definitions of Logical Terms, as of all terms of sci
ence strictly so called, are at once Nominal and Real; the

74

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

purposes of reasoning (which is the proper
province of Logic) is, that a term shall not be
used in different senses : a real definition of any
thing belongs to the science or system which
is employed about that thing. It is to be
noted, that in mathematics the Nominal and

Real Definition exactly coincide; the meaning
of the word, and the nature of the thing, being
exactly the same. This holds good also with

respect to Logical terms, most Legal, and many
Ethical terms.

It is scarcely credible how much confusion
has arisen from the ignorance of these distinc

tions which has prevailed among logical
writers.”

The principal rules for definition are three;

viz. 1st. The definition must be adequate ; i. e.
neither too extensive nor too narrow for the

thing defined: e. g. to define “fish,” “an ani
meaning of the word, and the nature of the thing, being in
this case the very same. See Diss. ch. ii. §. 3.
* In ch. ii. §. 3 of the concluding dissertation, the doc
trine here laid down will be more fully developed.

Aldrich having given as an instance of a Nominal Defi
nition the absurd one of “homo, qui exhumo,” has led some
to conclude that the Nominal Definition must be founded

on the etymology; or at least that such was his meaning;

but that it was not, is sufficiently plain from the circum
stance that Wallis (from whose work his is almost entirely
abridged) expressly says the contrary. Be this as it may,
however, it is plain that the etymology of a term has
nothing to do with any logical consideration of it. See

note to §. 8 of ch. iii.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

75

mal that lives in the water,” would be too ex

tensive, because many insects, &c, live in the
water; to define it, “an animal that has an
air-bladder,” would be too narrow ; because

many fish are without any.

2d. The definition must be in itself plainer
than the thing defined, else it would not explain
it: I say, “in itself.” (i. e. generally) because,
to some particular person, the term defined
may happen to be even more familiar and bet
ter understood, than the language of the de
finition.
3d. It must be couched in a convenient num

ber of appropriate words (if such can be found
suitable for the purpose), for figurative words
(which are opposed to appropriate) are apt to

produce ambiguity or indistinctness; too great
brevity may occasion obscurity; and too great
prolicity, confusion.

Part II.-Of Propositions.
§. 1.

The second part of logic treats of the propo
sition; which is, “Judgment expressed in
words.”

A Proposition is defined logically “a sentence ..."
indicative,” i. e. affirming or denying; (this

76

excludes commands and questions.) “Sentence”
being the genus, and “Indicative” the difference,
this definition expresses the whole essence;

and it relates entirely to the words of a propo
sition. With regard to the matter, its pro
perty is, to be true or false. Hence it must not
be ambiguous (for that which has more than
one meaning, is in reality several propositions),
nor imperfect, nor ungrammatical, for such an

expression has no meaning at all.
Since the substance (i. e. genus, or material
part) of a Proposition is, that it is a sentence;
and since every sentence (whether it be a pro
position or not) may be expressed either abso

found the division of propositions according
to their substance ; viz. into categorical and

hypothetical. And as genus is said to be pre
dicated in quid (what), it is by the members of

this division that we answer the question, what
is this proposition ? (qua est propositio.)
Answer, Categorical or Hypothetical.
Categorical propositions are subdivided into

pure, which asserts simply or purely, that the
subject does or does not agree with the predi
* As, “Caesar deserved death;” “did Caesar deserve
death P”

f As, “if Caesar was a tyrant, what did he deserve?”

“Was Caesar a hero or a villain?” “If Caesar was a tyrant,

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

77

cate, and modal, which expresses in what mode
(or manner) it agrees; e.g. “an intemperate
man will be sickly;” “Brutus killed Caesar;”

are pure. “An intemperate man will probably
be sickly;” “Brutus killed Caesar justly;” are
modal. At present we speak only of pure ca
tegorical propositions.
It being the differentia of a proposition, that
it affirms or denies, and its property to be true
or false; and Differentia being predicated in
quale quid, Property in quale, we hence form
another division of propositions, viz. according
to their quality, into affirmative, and negative, Quality.
(which is the quality of the expression, and
therefore, in Logic, essential) and into true and
false (which is the quality of the matter, and

therefore accidental.) An Affirmative proposi
tion is one whose copula is affirmative, as
“birds fly;” “not to advance is to go back;”
a Negative proposition is one whose copula is
negative, as “man is not perfect;” “no miser
is happy.”
Another division of propositions is accord-Quantity.

ing to their quantity (or extent;) if the predi
cate is said of the whole of the subject, the
proposition is universal: if of a part of it only,
the proposition is particular (or partial ;) e. g.
“England is an island;” “all tyrants are
miserable;” “ no miser is rich ;” are universal

propositions, and their subjects are therefore.

78

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

said to be distributed, being understood to
stand, each, for the whole of its Significates :
but, “ some islands are fertile;” “all tyrants
are not assassinated;” are particular, and their

subjects, consequently, not distributed, being
taken to stand for a part only of their Signifi
Cates.

As every proposition must be either affirma
tive or negative, and must also be either univer
sal or particular, we reckon, in all, four kinds
of pure categorical propositions, (i.e. consi
dered as to their quantity and quality both;)
viz. Universal Affirmative, whose symbol (used
for brevity) is A ; Universal Negative, E.; Par
ticular Affirmative, I; Particular Negative, 0.
§. 2.

When the subject of a proposition is a Com
mon-term, the universal signs (“all, no, every")
are used to indicate that it is distributed, (and

the proposition consequently is universal;) the
particular signs, (“ some, &c.”) the contrary :

should there be no sign at all to the common
term, the quantity of the proposition (which is
called an indefinite proposition) is ascertained
by the matter; i. e. the nature of the connexion
between the extremes; which is either Neces

sary, Impossible, or Contingent.
Indefinites.

In necessary

and in impossible matter, an Indefinite is un

derstood as a universal: e. g., “birds have

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

79

wings;" i. e. all: “birds are not quadrupeds;”
i. e. none: in contingent matter, (i. e. where

the terms partly (i.e. sometimes) agree, and
partly not) an Indefinite is understood as a par
ticular; e. g. “food is necessary to life;”
i.e. some food; “birds sing;" i.e. some do ;
“birds are not carnivorous;" i.e. some are not,
or, all are not.*

As for singular propositions, (viz. those singular
whose subject is either a proper name, or a
common term with a singular sign) they are
reckoned as Universals, (see ch. iv. §. 2.) be
cause in them we speak of the whole of the
subject; e.g. when we say, “ Brutus was a
Roman,” we mean, the whole of Brutus: this

is the general rule; but some singular propo
sitions Inay fairly be reckoned particular; i. e.

when some qualifying word is inserted, which
indicates that you are not speaking of the whole
of the subject; e. g. “Caesar was not wholly a

tyrant;” “this man is occasionally intemper
ate;” “ non omnis moriar.”

It is evident, that the subject is distributed in
every universal proposition, and never in a
* It is very perplexing to the learner, and needlessly so,
to reckon indefinites as one class of propositions in respect
of quantity. They must be either universal or particular,
though it is not declared which. Such a mode of classifica
tion resembles that of some grammarians, who, among the

Genders, enumerate the doubtful gender!

80

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

particular; (that being the very difference be
tween universal and particular propositions ;)
but the distribution or non-distribution of the

predicate, depends (not on the quantity, but) on
the quality, of the proposition ; for, if any part
of the predicate agrees with the subject, it must

be affirmed and not denied of the subject; there
fore, for an affirmative proposition to be true,
it is sufficient that some part of the predicate

agree with the subject; and (for the same rea
son) for a negative to be true, it is necessary
that the whole of the predicate should disagree
with the subject: e. g. it is true that “learning
is useful,” though the whole of the term “use
ful" does not agree with the term “learning,”
(for many things are useful besides learning,)
but “no vice is useful,” would be false, if any
part of the term “useful” agreed with the term
“vice;” (i.e. if you could find any one useful
thing which was a vice.) The two practical
rules then to be observed respecting distribu
tion, are,

1st. All universal propositions (and no par
ticular) distribute the subject.
2d. All negative (and no affirmative) the
predicate.
It may happen indeed, that the whole of the
predicate in an affirmative may agree with the
subject; e. g. it is equally true, that “all men
are rational animals;” and “all rational animals

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

Sl

are men:" but this is merely accidental, and is
not at all implied in the form of expression, which
alone is regarded in Logic.

Of Opposition.
§ 3.

Two propositions are said to be opposed to
each other, when, having the same subject and
predicate, they differ in quantity, or quality, or
both. It is evident, that with any given sub
ject and predicate, you may state four distinct
propositions, viz. A, E, I, and O'; any tWO
of which are said to be opposed; hence there

are four different kinds of opposition, viz. 1st. gº.
the two universals (A and E) are called contra-3...dies.

ries to each other; 2d. the two particular, (Isisten,
and O) subcontraries ; 3d. A and I, or E and

O, subalterns; 4th. A and O, or E and I, con
tradictories.
As it is evident, that the truth or falsity of

any proposition (its quantity and quality being

known) must depend on the matter of it, we
must bear in mind, that, “ in necessary matter

all affirmatives are true, and negatives false ; in
impossible matter, vice versa; in contingent mat
ter, all universals false, and particulars true;”
(e.g. “all islands (or, some islands) are sur

rounded by water,” must be true, because the
matter is necessary: to say, “no islands, or some
— not, &c.” would have been false; again,
G

82

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

“some islands are fertile;” “ some are not fer
tile,” are both true, because it is Contingent
Matter: put “all” or “no,” instead of “some,”
and the propositions will be false.) Hence it
will be evident, that Contraries will be both false
in Contingent matter, but never both true : Sub

contraries, both true in Contingent matter, but
never both false: Contradictories, always one true
and the other false, &c. with other observations,

which will be immediately made on viewing
the scheme; in which the four propositions are
denoted by their symbols, the different kinds
of matter by the initials, n, i, c, and the truth
or falsity of each proposition in each matter,

by the letter v. for (verum) true, f. for (falsum)

mind, and applying the above rule concerning
matter, the learner will easily elicit all the
maxims relating to opposition; as that, in the

Subalterns, the truth of the particular (which is
called the subalternate) follows from the truth

of the universal (subalternans), and the falsity of
the universal from the falsity of the particular:
that Subalterns differ in quantity alone; Con
traries, and also Subcontraries, in quality alone;
Contradictories, in both : and hence, that if
any proposition is known to be true, we infer

that its Contradictory is false;if false, its Con
tradictory true, &c.

Of Conversion.
§ 4.

A proposition is said to be converted when
its terms are transposed: when nothing more is
done, this is called simple conversion. No con
version is employed for any logical purpose,
unless it be illative ; i. e. when the truth of the

Converse follows from the truth of the Exposita,
(or proposition given;) e. g.
“No virtuous man is a rebel, therefore
No rebel is a virtuous man.”

“Some boasters are cowards, therefore
Some cowards are boasters.”

Conversion can then only be illative when Iſlative cons
versions

no term is distributed in the Converse, which was

not distributed in the Exposita ; (for if that be
G 2

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

done, you will employ a term universally in the
Converse, which was only used partially in the
Exposita.) Hence, as Edistributes both terms,
and I neither, these propositions may be illa
tively converted in the simple manner; (vide
Rule 2.) But as A does not distribute the pre
dicate, its simple conversion would not be illa
tive; (e.g. from “all birds are animals," you
cannot infer that “all animals are birds,") as
there would be a term distributed in the con

verse, which was not before. We must there

fore limit its quantity from universal to parti
cular, and the Conversion will be illative: (e.g.
“some animals are birds;") this might be fairly
named conversion by limitation; but is com
Conversion

... monly called “Conversion per accidens." E may

thus be converted also. But in O, whether the
quantity be changed or not, there will still be
a term (the predicate of the converse) distri
buted, which was not before: you can therefore
only convertitillatively, by changing the quality;

i.e. considering the negative as attached to the
predicate instead of to the copula, and thus regard
ing it as I. One of the terms will then not be
the same as before; but the proposition will be
equipollent (i.e. convey the same meaning);
e.g. “ some members of the university are not

learned:” you may consider “not-learned" as
the predicate, instead of “ learned ;” the propo
sition will then be I, and of course may be

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

85

simply converted, “ some who are not learned
are members of the university.” This may

be named conversion by negation ; or as it is
commonly called, by contra-position.* A may jºi.
also be fairly converted in this way, e.g.
“Every poet is a man of genius; therefore
He who is not a man of genius is not a poet:”
(or, “None but a man of genius can be a poet;”

or, “a man of genius alone can be a poet.”)

For (since it is the same thing, to affirm some
attribute of the subject, or to deny the absence

of that attribute) the original proposition is
precisely equipollent to this,
subj.

pred.
*-

“No

poet is not-a-man-of-genius ;”

which, being E, may of course be simply con
verted. Thus, in one of these three ways, every
proposition may be illatively converted: viz.

E, I, simply ; A, O, by negation ; A, E, limita
tion.

Note, that as it was remarked that, in some

affirmatives, the whole of the predicate does
actually agree with the subject, so, when this
is the case and is granted to be so, A may be
illatively converted, simply; but this is an ac
cidental circumstance. In a just Definition, this
* No mention is made by Aldrich of this kind of con

being in frequent use, and also as being employed in this
treatise for the direct reduction of Baroko and Bokardo.

is always the case; for there the terms being

exactly equivalent (or, as they are called, con
vertible terms) it is no matter which is made the

subject, and which the predicate, e.g. “a good
government is that which has the happiness of
the governed for its object;” if this be a right
definition, it will follow that “a government
which has the happiness of the governed for
its object is a good one.” Most propositions
in mathematics are of this description: e. g.
“All equilateral triangles are equiangular;” and
“All equiangular triangles are equilateral.”

Part III.-Of Arguments.
§ 1.

The third operation of the mind, viz. reason
ing, (or discourse) expressed in words, is argu
ment ; and an argument stated at full length,
and in its regular form, is called a syllogism :
the third part of Logic therefore treats of the

syllogism.

Every Argument” consists of two

parts ; that which is proced; and that by
means of which it is proved : the former is
called, before it is proved, the question; when
proved, the conclusion (or inference ;) that which
* I mean, in the strict technical sense; for in popular
use the word Argument is often employed to denote the
latter of these two parts alone: e.g. “this is an Argument
to prove so and so ;” “this conclusion is established by
the Argument:” i. e. Premisses.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

87

is used to prove it, if stated last (as is often
done in common discourse), is called the reason,
and is introduced by “because,” or some other

causal conjunction; (e.g. “Caesar deserved
death, because he was a tyrant, and all tyrants
deserve death.”)

If the conclusion be stated

last (which is the strict logical form, to which
all Reasoning may be reduced) then that which

is employed to prove it is called the premises;*
and the Conclusion is then introduced by some
illative conjunction, as “therefore” e. g.
“All tyrants deserve death;
Caesar was a tyrant;

therefore he deserved death.”f
* Both the premises together are sometimes called the
antecedent.

t It may be observed that the definition here given of
an argument is in the common treatises of logic laid down
as the definition of a syllogism ; a word which I have con

fined to a more restricted sense. There cannot evidently
be any argument, whether regularly or irregularly ex
pressed, to which the definition given by Aldrich, for in
stance, would not apply ; so that he appears to employ
“syllogism” as synonymous with “argument.” But be
sides that it is clearer and more convenient, when we have

these two words at hand, to employ them in the two senses
respectively which we want to express, the truth is, that in
so doing I have actually conformed to Aldrich's practice :
for he generally, if not always, employs the term Syllogism
in the very sense to which I have confined it: viz. to de
note an argument stated in regular logical form; as, e.g.,
in a part of his work (omitted in the late editions) in which
he is objecting to a certain pretended syllogism in the work
of another writer, he says, “valet certe argumentum ; syl

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

Since, then, an argument is an expression in
which “from something laid down and granted
as true (i. e. the Premises) something else (i. e.
the Conclusion) beyond this must be admitted to

be true, as following necessarily (or resulting)
from the other ; and since Logic is wholly con
cerned in the use of language, it follows that
a Syllogism (which is an argument stated in a
regular logical form) must be “an argument

manifest from the mere force of the expression,”
i. e. without considering the meaning of the
terms: e. g. in this syllogism, “Y is X, Z is
Y, therefore Z is X:” the conclusion is ine

vitable, whatever terms X, Y, and Z, respec
tively are understood to stand for. And to

this form all legitimate arguments may ulti
mately be brought.
§. 2.

The rule or axiom (commonly called “dictum
7.3%

de omni et nulio") by which Aristotle proves

the validity of this argument is this: “what
ever is predicated of a term distributed, whether
logismus tamen est falsissimus,” &c. Now (waiving the
exception that might be taken at this use of “falsissimus,”
nothing being, strictly, true or false, but a proposition) it is
plain that he limits the word “syllogism” to the sense in

which it is here defined, and is consequently inconsistent
with his own definition of it.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

89

affirmatively or negatively, may be predicated in
like manner of everything contained under it.”
Thus, in the examples above, X is predicated
of Y distributed, and Z is contained under Y
(i. e. is its subject;) therefore X is predicated

of Z: so “all tyrants,” &c. (p. 87.) This
rule may be ultimately applied to all arguments;
(and their validity ultimately rests on their
conformity thereto) but it cannot be directly
and immediately applied to all even of pure ca
tegorical syllogisms; for the sake of brevity,
therefore, some other axioms are commonly
applied in practice, to avoid the occasional te

diousness of reducing all syllogisms to that
form in which Aristotle's dictum is applicable.*
We will speak first of pure categorical syllo
* Instead of following Aldrich's arrangement, in laying
down first the canons which apply to all the figures of ca
tegorical syllogisms, and then going back to the “dictum
of Aristotle” which applies to only one of them, I have
pursued what appears a simpler and more philosophical
arrangement, and more likely to impress on the learner's
mind a just view of the science; viz. 1st. to give the rule
(Aristotle's dictum) which applies to the most clearly and
regularly constructed argument, the Syllogism in the first
figure, to which all reasoning may be reduced; then, the
canons applicable to all categoricals; then, those belonging

to the hypotheticals; and lastly to treat of the Sorites; which

is improperly placed by Aldrich before the hypotheticals.
By this plan the province of strict Logic is extended as far
as it can be ; every kind cf argument which is of a syllo
gistic character, and accordingly directly cognizable by
the rules of logic, being enumerated in natural order.

90

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

gisms; and the axioms or canons by which
their validity is to be proved: viz. first, if two
terms agree with one and the same third, they
agree with each other secondly, if one term

agrees and another disagrees with one and the
same third, these two disagree with each other.
On the former of these canons rests the va

lidity of affirmatice conclusions; on the latter,

of negative : for no categorical syllogism can
be faulty which does not violate these canons;
none correct which does : hence on these two

canons are built the rules or cautions which are

to be observed with respect to syllogisms, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether those
canons have been strictly observed or not.
1st. Every syllogism has three, and only three
terms : viz. the two terms (or extremes, as they
are commonly called) of the Conclusion (or
question) whereof, 1st, the subject is called

the minor term; 2nd, the predicate, the major;
and 3rd, the middle term, with which each
of them is separately compared, in order
to judge of their agreement or disagreement
with each other.

If therefore there were two

middle terms, the extremes, (or terms of the con

clusion) not being both compared to the same,
could not be conclusively compared to each
other.

2d. Every syllogism has three, and only three
propositions ; viz. 1st, the major premiss (in

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

91

which the major term is compared with the
middle ;) 2nd, the minor premiss (in which the
minor term is compared with the middle ;) and
3rd, the Conclusion, in which the Minor

term is compared with the Major.
3d. Note, that if the middle term is ambi.

guous, there are in reality two middle terms, in
sense, though but one in sound. An ambi
guous middle term is either an equivocal term,
used in different senses in the two premises :
(e. g.
“Light is contrary to darkness;
Feathers are light ; therefore
Feathers are contrary to darkness.”)

Or a term not distributed: for as it is then

used to stand for a part only of its significates,

it may happen that one of the extremes may
have been compared with one part of it, and

the other with another part of it; e. g.
“White is a colour,

Black is a colour; therefore

Black is white.”—Again,
“Some animals are beasts,

Some animals are birds; therefore
Some birds are beasts.”

The middle term therefore must be distributed
once, at least, in the premises; (i.e. by being

the subject of an universal, or predicate of a
negative, part ii., § 2. p. 78.) and once is suffi

92

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

cient; since if one extreme has been compared
to a part of the middle term, and another to
the whole of it, they must have been both com
pared to the same.
4th. No term must be distributed in the con

clusion which was not distributed in one of the
premises ; for that (which is called an illicit
process, either of the Major or the Minor term)
would be to employ the whole of a term in the

Conclusion, when you had employed only a
part of it in the Premiss; and thus, in reality,
to introduce a fourth term; e.g.
“All quadrupeds are animals,
A bird is not a quadruped; therefore
It is not an animal.”—Illicit process of the major.

5th. From negative premises you can infer
nothing. For in them the Middle is pro
nounced to disagree with both crtremes ; not to
agree with both ; or to agree with one, and
disagree with the other; therefore they cannot
be compared together ; e. g.
“A fish is not a quadruped;”
“A bird is not a quadruped,” proves nothing.

6th. If one premiss be negative, the conclu
sion must be negative ; for in that premiss the
middle term is pronounced to disagree with
one of the extremes, and in the other premiss

(which of course is affirmative by the preceding

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

93

rule) to agree with the other extreme; there
fore the extremes disagreeing with each other,
the conclusion is negative. In the same man
ner it may be shown, that to prove a negative
conclusion one of the Premises must be a nega
tive.

*By these six rules all Syllogisms are to be
tried; and from them it will be evident; 1st,
that nothing can be proved from two particular

Premises ; (for you will then have either the
middle Term undistributed, or an illicit process :
6. 9.

“Some animals are sagacious;
Some beasts are not sagacious;
Some beasts are not animals.”)

And, for the same reason, 2ndly, that if one
of the Premises be particular, the Conclusion
must be particular ; e. g.
“All who fight bravely deserve reward;

Some soldiers fight bravely;” you can only infer
that “Some soldiers deserve reward:”

for to infer a universal Conclusion, would
* Aldrich has given twelve rules, which I found might
more conveniently be reduced to six. No syllogism can
be faulty which violates none of these six rules. It is
much less perplexing to a learner not to lay down as a
distinct rule that, e.g. against particular premises ; which
is properly a result of the foregoing; since a syllogism
with two particular premises would offend against either
R. 3. or R. 4.

94

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

be an illicit process of the minor. But from
two universal Premises you cannot always
infer a universal Conclusion; e.g.
“All gold is precious,
All gold is a mineral; therefore

Some mineral is precious.”

And even when we can infer a universal, we

are always at liberty to infer a particular; since
what is predicated of all may of course be predi
cated of some.

Of Moods.
§. 3.

When we designate the three propositions
of a syllogism in their order, according to their
respective quantity and quality (i. e. their sym
bols) we are said to determine the mood of the
syllogism; e. g. the example just above, “all
gold, &c." is in the mood A, A, I. As there
are four kinds of propositions, and three pro

positions in each syllogism, all the possible
ways of combining these four, (A, E, I, O.) by
threes, are sixty-four. For any one of these
four may be the major premiss, each of these
four majors may have four different minors,
* Aldrich, by a strange oversight, has so expressed
himself as to imply (though he could hardly mean it) that
we always may, if we will, infer a universal conclusion for
two universal premises.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

95

and of these sixteen pairs of premises, each may
have four different conclusions, 4 x 4 (= 16)
x 4 = 64.

This is a mere arithmetical cal

culation of the moods, without any regard to
the logical rules: for many of these moods are
inadmissable in practice, from violating some
of those rules; e.g. the mood E, E, E, must

be rejected, as having negative premises ; I, O,
O, for particular premises ; and many others for
the same faults. By examination then of all,
it will be found that, of the sixty-four, there
remain but twelve moods which can be used
in a legitimate syllogism, viz. A, A, A, A, A, I,
A, E, E, A, E, O, A, I, I, A, O, O, E, A, E,
E, A, O, E, I, O, I, A, I, I, E, O, O, A, O.

Of Figure.
§. 4.

The Figure of a syllogism consists in the si
tuation of the Middle term with respect to the
Extremes of the Conclusion, (i.e. the major and
minor term.) When the Middle term is made

the subject of the major premiss, and the predicate
of the minor, that is called the first Figure;

(which is far the most natural and clear of all,

as to this alone Aristotle's Dictum may be at
once applied.) In the second Figure the Middle
term is the predicate of both premises: in the

third, the subject of both: in the fourth, the pre

dicate of the Major premiss, and the subject of

ELEMENTs of LOGIC.

96
º

the Minor. (This is the most awkward and
unnatural of all, being the very reverse of the
first.) Note, that the proper order is to place
the Major premiss first, and the Minor second ;
but this does not constitute the Major and Minor
premises; for that premiss (wherever placed)
is the Major, which contains the major term, and

the Minor, the Minor, (v. R. 2. p. 90.) Each
of the allowable Moods mentioned above will

not be allowable in every Figure; since it may
violate some of the foregoing rules, in one
Figure, though not in another: e. g. I, A., I,
is an allowable mood in the third Figure; but in
the first, it would have an undistributed middle.*

So A, E, E, would in the first Figure have an
illicit process of the major, but is allowable in
the second ; and A, A, A, which in the first

Figure is allowable, would in the third have an
illicit process of the minor: all which may be
ascertained by trying the different Moods in
each Figure, as per scheme.

minor, Y the middle.

The Terms alone being here stated, the quan
tity and quality of each Proposition (and conse
quently the Mood of the whole Syllogism) is

left to be filled up: (i.e. betwen Y and X, we
may place either a negative or affirmative Co
pula; and we may prefix either a universal or
particular sign to Y.) By applying the Moods
then to each Figure, it will be found that each
Figure will admit six moods only, as not vio
lating the rules against undistributed middle,
and against illicit process : and of the Moods so
admitted, several (though valid) are useless, as
having a particular Conclusion, when a univer
sal might have been drawn; e. g. A, A, I, in
th first Figure,
“All human creatures are entitled to liberty;
All slaves are human creatures; therefore

Some slaves are entitled to liberty.”

Of the twenty-four Moods, then, (six in each
Figure) five are for this reason neglected: for

the remaining nineteen, logicians have devised
names to distinguish both the Mood itself, and

the Figure in which it is found; since when
one Mood (i.e. one in itself, without regard to

Figure) occurs in two different Figures, (as
H

98

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

E, A, E, in the first and second) the mere let
ters denoting the mood would not inform us
concerning the figure. In these names, then,

the three vowels denote the propositions of
which the Syllogism is composed; the conso
nants (besides their other uses, of which here

after) serve to keep in mind the Figure of the
Syllogism.

By a careful study of these mnemonic lines

Conclusions, we have only to consider, that in
it the middle term being the predicate in both
premises, would not be distributed unless one pre
miss were negative : (v. R. 2. p. 69.) there

fore the Conclusion must be negative also, by

R. 6. p. 92. One Mood in each Figure may
suffice in this place by way of example;

(bA) every Z is Y ; therefore (ra) every Z is
X: e.g. let the major term (which is repre
sented by X) be “one who possesses all vir
the minor term (Z) “every man who
possesses one virtue;” and the middle term

(Y) “every one who possesses prudence;" and
you will have the celebrated argument of Aris
totle, Eth. sixth book, to prove that the virtues
are inseparable; viz.
“He who possesses prudence, possesses all virtue;
He who possesses one virtue, must possess prudence;
therefore

He who possesses one, possesses all.”

Second, Camestres, (cAm) every X is Y;
(Es) no Z is Y; (trES) no Z is X.

minor (Z) “the Epicureans;” the middle (Y)

(r.Ap) every Y is Z, therefore, (tſ.) Some Z
is X: e. g.
“Prudence has for its object the benefit of individuals;
but prudence is a virtue; therefore, some virtue has for its
object the benefit of the individual,”

is part of Adam Smith's reasoning (Moral Sen
timents) against Hutcheson and others, who
placed all virtue in benevolence.

“Whatever is expedient, is conformable to nature;
Whatever is conformable to nature, is not hurtful to so
ciety; therefore

What is hurtful to society is never expedient,”

is part of Cicero's argument in Off third book;
but it is an inverted and clumsy way of stating

what would much more naturally fall into the
first Figure; for if you examine the Proposi
tions of a Syllogism in the fourth Figure, be
ginning at the Conclusion, you will see that as

the major term is predicated of the minor, so
is the minor of the middle, and that again of
the major: so that the major appears to be
merely predicated of itself. Hence the five
Moods in this Figure are seldom or never used;
some one of the fourteen (moods with names) in
*

the first three Figures, being the forms into

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

101

which all arguments may most readily be
thrown; but of these, the four in the first Figure
are the clearest and most natural; as to them

Aristotle's Dictum will immediately apply. And
as it is on this Dictum that all Reasoning ulti

mately depends, so all arguments may be some
how or other brought into some one of these
four Moods; and a Syllogism is, in that case,
said to be reduced: (i. e. to the first figure.)
These four are called the perfect moods, and
all the rest imperfect.
Ostensive Reduction.

§. 5.

In reducing a Syllogism, we are not, of
course, allowed to introduce any new Term or
Proposition, having nothing granted but the
truth of the Premises; but these Premises are

allowed to be illatively converted (because the

truth of any Proposition implies that of its illa
tive converse) or transposed: by taking advan
tage of this liberty, where there is need, we
deduce (in Figure 1st,) from the Premises ori
-

ginally given, either the very same Conclusion as
the original one, or another from which the
original Conclusion follows, by illative con
version; e. g. Darapti.

All wits are admired;

103

and the rest of the Syllogism remains the
same; only that the minor Premiss must be
considered as affirmative, because you take
“not-a-friend-to-religion,” as the middle Term.

In the same manner Bokardo” to Darii; e. g.
“Some slaves are not discontented ;
All slaves are wronged; therefore

Some who are wronged are not discontented.”

Convert the major by negation (contraposi

tion) and then transpose them; the Conclu
sion will be the converse by negation of the ori

ginal one, which therefore may be inferred from
it; e. g.
“All slaves are wronged;

-

Some who are not discontented are slaves;

Some who are not discontented are wronged.”

In these ways (by what is called Ostensive
Reduction, because you prove, in the first figure,

either the very same Conclusion as before, or

one which implies it) all the imperfect Moods
may be reduced to the four perfect ones. But
there is also another way, called
Reductio ad impossibile.
§. 6.

By which we prove (in the first figure) not
directly that the original Conclusion is true, but

that it cannot be false; i. e. that an absurdity
would follow from the supposition of its being
false; e. g.
“All true patriots are friends to religion;
Some great statesmen are not friends to religion;
Some great statesmen are not true patriots.”

If this Conclusion be not true, its contradic

tory must be true; viz.
“All great statesmen are true patriots.”

Let this then be assumed, in the place of the

minor Premiss of the original Syllogism, and a
false conclusion will be proved; e.g. bar.
“All true patriots are friends to religion;
bA, All great statesmen are true patriots;
rA, All great statesmen are friends to religion :”

for as this Conclusion is the contradictory of
the original minor Premiss, it must be false,
since the Premises are always supposed to be
granted; therefore one of the Premises (by
which it has been correctly proved) must be
false also ; but the major Premiss (being one
of those originally granted) is true; therefore
the falsily must be in the minor Premiss ; which

is the contradictory of the original Conclusion;
therefore the original Conclusion must be
true.

§. 7.

This kind of Reduction is seldom employed
but for Baroko and Bokardo, which are thus

reduced by those who confine themselves to

simple Conversion, and Conversion by limita
tion, (per accidens ;) and they framed the names
of their Moods, with a view to point out the
manner in which each is to be reduced; viz. B.,
C, D, F, which are the initial letters of all the

Moods, indicate to which Mood of the first
figure (Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Ferio)
each of the others is to be reduced: m indicates

that the Premises are to be transposed; s and p,
that the Proposition denoted by the vowel im
mediately preceding, is to be converted; s, sim

ply, p, per accidens, (by limitation:) thus, in
Camestres, (see example, p. 99,) the C indi
cates that it must be reduced to Celarent; the

two ss, that the minor Premiss and Conclusion

must be converted simply; the m, that the Pre
mises must be transposed. K (which indicates
the reduction ad impossibile) is a sign that the

Proposition, denoted by the vowel immediately
before it, must be left out, and the contradic

tory of the Conclusion substituted; viz. for the
minor Premiss in Baroko, and the major in Bo
kardo. But it has been already shown, that the

Conversion by contraposition (by negation)

will enable us to reduce these two Moods, os

§ 1.
Hitherto we have treated of pure categorical

Propositions,

and the

Syllogisms composed of
such. A Modal Proposition may be stated as
a pure one, by attaching the Mode to one of the

Terms: and the Proposition will in all respects
fall under the foregoing rules ; e. g. “John

killed Thomas wilfully and maliciously;” here
the Mode is to be regarded as part of the Pre

dicate. “It is probable that all knowledge is
useful;” “probably-useful" is here the Predi
cate. But when the Mode is only used to ex
press the necessary, contingent, or impossible
connection of the Terms, it may as well be at
tached to the Subject: e.g. “man is necessarily
mortal;” is the same as “all men are mortal:”
* If any one should choose that the names of these
moods should indicate this, he might make K the index of
conversion by negation; and then the names would be, by .

“ injustice is in no case expedient” corresponds
to “no injustice is expedient:” and “this man
is occasionally intemperate,” has the force of a

particular : (vide Part II. §. 2. p. 78.) It is
thus, and thus only, that two singular Proposi
tions may be contradictories; e.g. “this man
is never intemperate,” will be the contradictory

of the foregoing. Indeed every sign (of uni
versality or particularity) may be considered as
a Mode. Since, however, in all Modal Propo
sitions, you assert that the dictum (i. e. the

assertion itself) and the Mode, agree together,
or disagree, so, in spine cases, this may be the

A hypothetical Proposition is defined to be,
two or more categoricals united by a Copula (or

conjunction), and the different kinds of hypo
thetical Propositions are named from their
respective conjunctions; viz. conditional, dis
junctive, causal, &c.

-

-

When a hypothetical Conclusion is inferred
from a hypothetical Premiss, so that the force
of the Reasoning does not turn on the hypo
thesis, then the hypothesis (as in Modals)
must be considered as part of one of the Terms;
so that the Reasoning will be, in effect, catego
rical: e. g.
predicate.

“Every conqueror is

either a hero or a villain.

Caesar was a conqueror; therefore
predicate.

He was either a hero or a villain.”

“Whatever comes from God is entitled to reverence;
subject.

If the Scriptures are not wholly false, they must come
from God;

If they are not wholly false, they are entitled to reve
rence.”

But when the Reasoning itself rests on the
hypothesis (in which way a categorical Con

clusion may be drawn from a hypothetical
Premiss,) this is what is called a hypothetical
Syllogism ; and rules have been devised for
ascertaining the validity of such Arguments
at once, without bringing them into the cate

gorical form. (And note, that in these Syllo
gisms the hypothetical Premiss is called the

major, and the categorical one the minor.)
They are of two kinds, conditional and dis
junctive.
Of Conditionals.
§. 3.

A Conditional Proposition has in it an illative
jorce ; i. e. it contains two, and only two cate
gorical Propositions, whereof one results from
the other (or follows from it,) e. g.
antecedent.

“If the Scriptures are not wholly false,
consequent.

they are entitled to respect.”

That from which the other results is called the
antecedent ; that which results from it, the con
sequent (consequens ;) and the connection be
tween the two (expressed by the word “if”)
the consequence (consequentia.) The natural
order is, that the antecedent should come

before the consequent; but this is frequently
reversed: e.g. “the husbandman is well off if

he knows his own advantages;" Virg. Geor.
And note, that the truth or falsity of a condi
tional Proposition depends entirely on the
consequence: e.g. “if Logic is useless, it de
serves to be neglected;" here both Antecedent

and Consequent are false : yet the whole Pro
position is true ; i.e. it is true that the Conse

110

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

quent follows from the Antecedent. “If
Cromwell was an Englishman, he was an

usurper,” is just the reverse case: for though
it is true that “Cromwell was an English
man,” and also that “he was an usurper," yet
it is not true that the latter of these Proposi

tions depends on the former; the whole Pro
position, therefore, is false, though both Ante

cedent and Consequent are true. A Condi
tional Proposition, in short, may be considered
as an assertion of the validity of a certain

Argument; since to assert that an Argument is
valid, is to assert that the Conclusion necessa

rily results from the Premises, whether those
Premises be true or not.

The meaning, then, of a Conditional Propo
sition is this ; that, the antecedent being granted,
the consequent is granted: which may be con
sidered in two points of view: first, if the
Antecedent be true, the Consequent must be
true; hence the first rule; the antecedent being
granted, the consequent may be inferred: second
ly, if the Antecedent were true, the Consequent
would be true; hence the second rule; the con

sequent being denied, the antecedent may be de
nied ; for the Antecedent must in that case be

false; since if it were true, the Consequent
(which is granted to be false) would be true
also : e.g. “if this man has a fever, he is sick:”

here, if you grant the antecedent, the first rule

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

111

applies, and you infer the truth of the Conse
quent; “he has a fever, therefore he is sick:”
if A is B, C is D; but A is B, therefore C is
D (and this is called a constructive Conditional

Syllogism;) but if you deny the consequent (i. e.
grant its contradictory) the second rule applies,

and you infer the contradictory of the antecedent;
“he is not sick, therefore he has not a fever:”

this is the destructive Conditional Syllogism:
if A is B, C is D; C is not D, therefore A is
not B. Again, “if the crops are not bad,
corn must be cheap,” for a major; then, “but
the crops are not bad, therefore corn must be
cheap,” is Constructive. “Corn is not cheap,
therefore the crops are bad,” is Destructive.
“If every increase of population is desirable,
some misery is desirable; but no misery is
desirable; therefore, some increase of popula
tion is not desirable,” is Destructive.

But if

you affirm the consequent, or deny the antecedent,
you can infer nothing ; for the same Conse
quent may follow from other Antecedents: e.g.
in the example above, a man may be sick from
other disorders besides a fever; therefore it

does not follow, from his being sick, that he
has a fever; nor (for the same reason) from
his not having a fever, that he is not sick.
There are, therefore, two, and only two, kinds
of Conditional Syllogisms ; the constructive,
founded on the first rule, and answering to

112

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

direct Reasoning; and the destructive, on the
second, answering to indirect.
And note, that a Conditional Proposition

may (like the categorical A) be converted by
negation ; i.e. you may take the contradictory
of the consequent, as an antecedent, and the con
tradictory of the antecedent, as a consequent : e.g.
“if this man is not sick he has not a fever.”

By this conversion of the major Premiss, a

Constructive Syllogism may be reduced to a
Destructive, and vice versä. (See §.6. Ch. IV.
p. 103.)
º

Of Disjunctives.
§. 4.

A Disjunctive Proposition may consist of
any number of categoricals; and, of these,
some one, at least, must be true, or the whole

Proposition will be false: if, therefore, one or
more of these categoricals be denied (i. e. grant
ed to be false) you may infer that the remain
ing one, or (if several) some one of the remain
ing ones, is true: e.g. “either the earth is
eternal, or the work of chance, or the work of
an intelligent Being ; it is not eternal, nor the
work of chance ; therefore it is the work of

an intelligent Being.” “It is either spring,
summer, autumn, or winter; but it is neither

spring nor summer; therefore it is either

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

autumn or winter.”

113

Either A is B, or C is D;

but A is not B, therefore C is D.

Note, that

in these examples (as well as very many others)
it is implied not only that one of the members
(the categorical Propositions) must be true,

but that only one can be true; so that, in such
cases, if one or more members be affirmed, the
rest may be denied ; [the members may then

be called exclusive: e.g. “it is summer, there
fore it is neither spring, autumn, nor winter;"
“either A is B, or C is D.; but A is B, there

fore C is not D.” But this is by no means
universally the case; e. g. “virtue tends to
procure us either the esteem of mankind, Or
the favour of God:” here both members are

true, and consequently from one being affirmed
we are not authorized to deny the other.
It is evident that a disjunctive Syllogism may
easily be reduced to a conditional: e. g. if it
is not spring or summer, it is either autumn
or winter, &c.

The Dilemma,”
§. 5,

is a complex kind of Conditional Syllogism.
1st. If you have in the major Premiss sere
ral antecedents all with the same consequent,
* The account usually given of the Dilemma in Logical
treatises is singularly perplexed and unscientific. Aldrich
in speaking of it abstains from all use of Logical terms, and
I

114

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

then these Antecedents, being (in the minor)
disjunctively granted (i. e. it being granted that
some one of them is true), the one common con

sequent may be inferred (as in the case of a
simple Constructive Syllogism :) e.g. if A is B,
C is D; and if X is Y, C is D; but either A is
B, or X is Y; therefore C is D. “If the blest

in heaven have no desires, they will be perfectly
content; so they will, if their desires are fully
gratified; but either they will have no desires,
Di or have them fully gratified; therefore they
will be perfectly content.” Note, in this case,
the two conditionals which make up the major

Premiss may be united in one Proposition by
means of the word “whether:” e.g. “whether
the blest, &c. have no desires, or have their
desires gratified, they will be content.”
Complex con
structive Di
lemma.

2d. But if the several antecedents have each

a different consequent, then the Antecedents,

being, as before, disjunctively granted, you can
speaks in a loose, vague, and rhetorical manner. And it
is remarkable that all the rules he gives respecting it, and
the faults against which he cautions us, relate exclusively
to the Subject matter: as if one were to lay down as rules
respecting a Syllogism in Barbara, “1st. Care must be
taken that the major Premiss be true; 2dly. That the minor
Premiss be true !”

Most, if not all, writers on this point either omit to tell
us whether the Dilemma is a kind of conditional or of

disjunctive argument, or else refer it to the latter class, on

account of its having one disjunctive Premiss; though it
clearly belongs to the class of conditionals.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

115

only disjunctively infer the Consequents: e. g.
if A is B, C is D; and if X is Y, E is F: but
either A is B, or X is Y; therefore either C is

D, or E is F. “If AEschines joined in the
public rejoicings, he is inconsistent; if he did
not, he is unpatriotic; but he either joined, or
not, therefore he is either inconsistent, or un
patriotic.” (Demost. For the Crown.) This

case, as well as the foregoing, is evidently con
structive.

In the Destructive form, whether you have
one Antecedent with several Consequents, or
several Antecedents either with one, or with

several Consequents; in all these cases, if you
deny the whole of the Consequent or Conse
quents, you may in the conclusion deny the
whole of the Antecedent or Antecedents: e. g.
“if the world were eternal, the most useful arts,

such as printing, &c. would be of unknown
antiquity: and on the same supposition, there

would be records long prior to the Mosaic;
and likewise the sea and land, in all parts of

the globe, might be expected to maintain the
same relative situations now as formerly: but
none of these is the fact: therefore the world

is not eternal.” Again, “if the world existed
from eternity, there would be records prior to
the Mosaic; and if it were produced by chance,
it would not bear marks of design : there are

no records prior to the Mosaic; and the world
I2

116

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

does bear marks of design: therefore it neither

existed from eternity, nor is the work of
chance.” These are commonly called Dilem
mas, but hardly differ from simple conditional

Syllogisms. Nor is the case different if you
have one antecedent with several consequents,
which consequents you disjunctively deny; for
that comes to the same thing as wholly denying
them; since if they be not all true, the one an
tecedent must equally fall to the ground ; and
the Syllogism will be equally simple: e. g.” “if
we are at peace with France by virtue of the
treaty of Paris, we must acknowledge the
sovereignty of Buonaparte; and also we must
acknowledge that of Louis : but we cannot do

both of these ; therefore we are not at peace,”
&c.; which is evidently a plain destructive.

The true Dilemma is, “a conditional Syllogism
with several antecedents in the major, and a dis
junctive minor;” hence,
Destructive
Dilemma.

3d. That is most properly called a destruc
tive Dilemma, which has (like the constructive

ones) a disjunctive minor Premiss : i. e. when you
have several Antecedents with each a different

Consequent ; which Consequents (instead of

wholly denying them, as in the case lately men
tioned) you disjunctively deny; and thence, in
the Conclusion, deny disjunctively the Antece

dents: e.g. if A is B, C is D; and if X is Y,
* A.D. 1815.

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

117

E is F: but either C is not D, or E is not F;
therefore, either A is not B, or X is not Y.
“If this man were wise, he would not speak

irreverently of Scripture injest; and if he were
good he would not do so in earnest; but he
does it, either in jest, or earnest; therefore he
is either not wise or not good.”

Every Dilemma may be reduced into two or ºf
more simple Conditional Syllogisms: e.g. “If
AEschines joined, &c. he is inconsistent; he
did join, &c. therefore he is inconsistent: and
again, if AEschines did not join, &c. he is un
patriotic: he did not, &c. therefore he is unpa
triotic.” Now an opponent might deny either
of the minor Premises in the above Syllogisms,
but he could not deny both ; and therefore he
must admit one or the other of the Conclu

sions: for, when a Dilemma is employed, it is
supposed that some one of the Antecedents must
be true (or, in the destructive kind, some one

of the Consequents false), but that we cannot
tell which of them is so ; and this is the reason

why the argument is stated in the form of a
Dilemma.

From what has been said, it may easily be
seen that all Dilemmas are in fact conditional

syllogisms; and that Disjunctive Syllogisms may
also be reduced to the form of Conditionals:

but as it has been remarked, that all Reasoning

whatever may ultimately be brought to the one

IIS

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

test of Aristotle's “Dictum,” it remains to show

how a Conditional Syllogism may be thrown
into such a form, that that test will at once

apply to it; and this is called the
Reduction of Hypotheticals.”
§. 6.

For this purpose we must consider every
Conditional Proposition as a universal affirma
* Aldrich has stated, through a mistake, that Aristotle
utterly despised Hypothetical Syllogisms, and thence made
no mention of them ; but he did indicate his intention to

treat of them in some part of his work, which either was not

completed by him according to his design, or else (in com
mon with many of his writings) has not come down to us.
Aldrich observes, that no hypothetical argument is valid
which cannot be reduced to a categorical form ; and this is
evidently agreeable to what has been said at the beginning

of this part; but then he has unfortunately omitted to teach
us how to reduce Hypotheticals to this form, except in the
case where the Antecedent and Consequent chance to have
each the same subjects; in which case, he tells us to take the

minor Premiss and Conclusion as an Enthymeme, and fill
that up categorically; e.g. “If Caesar was a tyrant, he
deserved death: he was a tyrant; therefore he deserved
death;” which may easily be reduced to a categorical
form, by taking as a major Premiss, “all tyrants deserve
death.”

But when (as is often the case) the Antecedent

and Consequent have not each the same subject, (as in the
very example he gives, “if A is B, C is D,”) he gives no
rule for reducing such a Syllogism as has a Premiss of this
kind; and indeed leads us to suppose that it is to be re
jected as invalid, though he has just before demonstrated
its validity. And this is likely to have been one among
the various causes which occasion many learners to regard
the whole system of Logic as a string of idle reveries, hav
ing nothing true, substantial, or practically useful in it;

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

119

tive categorical Proposition, of which the
Terms are entire

Propositions, viz. the antece

dent answering to the Subject, and the conse
quent to the Predicate; e.g. to say, “if Louis
is a good king, France is likely to prosper,” is
equivalent to saying, “the case of Louis being
a good king, is a case of France being likely
-->

to prosper:” and if it be granted, as a minor

Premiss to the Conditional Syllogism, that
“Louis is a good king,” that is equivalent to
saying, “the present case is the case of Louis
being a good king;" from which you will draw
a conclusion in Barbara, (viz. “ the present
case is a case of France being likely to pro
sper,”) exactly equivalent to the original Con
clusion of the Conditional Syllogism ; viz.
“France is likely to prosper.” As the Con
structive Conditional may thus be reduced to
Barbara, so may the Destructive, in like man
ner, to Celarent: e.g. “if the Stoics are right,
pain is no evil: but pain is an evil; therefore,
the Stoics are not right;" is equivalent to—
but of the same character with the dreams of Alchymy,
Demonology, and judicial Astrology. Such a mistake is
surely the less inexcusable in a learner, when his master first
demonstrates the validity of a certain argument, and then tells
him that after all it is good for nothing ; (prorsus repu

diandum.) In the late editions of Aldrich's Logic, all
that he says of the reduction of Hypotheticals is omitted;
which certainly would have been an improvement, if a
more correct one had been substituted; but as it is, there

is a complete hiatus in the system. .

I20

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

“ the case of the Stoics being right, is the case
of pain being no evil; the present case is not

the case of pain being no evil; therefore the
present case is not the case of the Stoics being
right.” This is Camestres, which, of course, is
easily reduced to Celarent. Or, if you will, all
Conditional Syllogisms may be reduced to Bar
bara, by considering them all as constructive ;

which may be done, as mentioned above, by
converting by negation the major Premiss.
(See p. 112.)

The reduction of Hypotheticals may always
be effected in the manner above stated; but as

it produces a circuitous awkwardness of ex
pression, a more convenient form may in some
cases be substituted: e. g. in the example
above, it may be convenient to take “true"
for one of the Terms: “that pain is no evil is
not true; that pain is no evil is asserted by the
Stoics; therefore something asserted by the
Stoics is not true.” Sometimes again it may

be better to unfold the argument into two Syl
logisms: e. g. in a former example; first,
“Louis is a good king; the governor of France
is Louis; therefore the governor of France is
a good king.” And then, second, “every
country governed by a good king is likely to
prosper,” &c. [A Dilemma is generally to be
reduced into two or more categorical Syllo

gisms.] And when the antecedent and conse

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

I21

quent have each the same Subject, you may
sometimes reduce the Conditional by merely
substituting a categorical major Premiss for the
conditional one : e.g. instead of “if Caesar was
a tyrant, he deserved death; he was a tyrant,

therefore he deserved death;” you may put for
a major, “all tyrants deserve death,” &c. But
it is of no great consequence, whether Hypo
theticals are reduced in the most meat and con

cise manner or not; since it is not intended

that they should be reduced to categoricals, in
ordinary practice, as the readiest way of trying
their validity, (their own rules being quite suf
ficient for that purpose ;) but only that we
should be able, if required, to subject any argu
ment whatever to the test of Aristotle's Dic

tum, in order to show that all Reasoning turns
upon one simple principle.

gism with one Premiss suppressed. As all
the Terms will be found in the remaining Pre
miss and Conclusion, it will be easy to fill up

the Syllogism by supplying the Premiss that is
wanting, whether major or minor:

e. g.

122

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

“Caesar was a tyrant; therefore he deserved
death.” “A free nation must be happy; there
fore the English are happy.”
This is the ordinary form of speaking and
writing. It is evident that Enthymemes may

be filled up hypothetically.*

state these briefly, in a form called Sorites; in

which the Predicate of the first proposition is
made the Subject of the next; and so on, to
any length, till finally the Predicate of the last
of the Premises is predicated (in the Conclu
sion) of the Subject of the first: e. g. A is B,
B is C, C is D, D is E.; therefore A is E.
“The English are a brave people; a brave peo
ple are free; a free people are happy; there
fore the English are happy.” A Sorites, then,
has as many middle Terms as there are inter

mediate Propositions between the first and the

last; and, consequently, it may be drawn out
into as many separate Syllogisms; of which the

gistic; i.e. its conclusiveness is not apparent from the mere
form of expression, without regard to the meaning of the
Terms, because it is from that we form our judgment as to
the truth of the suppressed Premiss. The Sorites, on the
other hand, is strictly syllogistic; as may be seen by the
examples.

first will have, for its major Premiss, the se
cond, and for its minor, the first of the Propo
sitions of the Sorites; as may be seen by the
example.

It is also evident, that in a Sorites

you cannot have more than one negative Pro
position, and one particular; for else, one of

the Syllogisms would have its Premises both
negative or both particular, (vide p. 93.)

A string of Conditional Syllogisms may in Hºtel
like manner be abridged into a Sorites; e.g. if
A is B, C is D; if C is D, E is F; if E is F,
G is H.; but A is B, therefore G is H.

Induction, for instance, or of a priori reasoning,
&c. as distinct Forms of argument; for when
thrown into the syllogistic form, and when let
ters of the alphabet are substituted for the
Terms (and it is thus that an Argument is pro

Logic), there is no distinction between them ;
e.g. a “Property which belongs to the ox,

sheep, deer, goat, and antelope, belongs to all
horned animals; rumination belongs to these ;
therefore, to all.” This, which is an inductive
argument, is evidently a Syllogism in Barbara.

The essence of an inductive argument (and so
of the other kinds which are distinguished for
it) consists, not in the form of the Argument,
but in the relation which the Subject matter
of the Premises bears to that of the Conclu

the same time: e.g. “all useful studies deserve
encouragement; Logic is such, (since it helps
us to reason accurately,) therefore it deserves
encouragement;" here the minor Premiss is
what is called an Enthymematic sentence. The
antecedent in that minor Premiss (i. e. that
which makes it Enthymematic) is called by

Aristotle the Prosyllogism.

sight appear faulty, will often be found, on *
examination, to contain correct reasoning, and,
consequently, to be reducible to a regular
form; e.g. when you have, apparently, negative
Premises, it may happen, that by considering
one of them as affirmative, (see Ch. II. §. 4.
p. 85.) the Syllogism will be regular: e. g.
“no man is happy who is not secure ; no ty

an irregularity in the expression: e. g. “no.
irrational agent could produce a work which,
manifests design; the universe is a work which
manifests design; therefore no irrational agent

could have produced the universe.” Strictly
speaking, this Syllogism has five Terms; but
if you look to the meaning, you will see, that
in the first Premiss (considering it as a part of
this Argument) it is not, properly, “an irra

tional agent” that you are speaking of, and of
which you predicate that it could not produce

a work manifesting design; but rather it is
this “work,” &c. of which you are speaking,
and of which it is predicated that it could not
be produced by an irrational agent; if then you.
state the Propositions in that form, the Syllo

gism will be perfectly regular.

you do not really predicate of “few men,”

that they are “disinterested,” but of “dis
interested persons,” that they are “few.”

Again, “none but candid men are good rea
soners; few infidels are candid; few infidels

are good reasoners." In this it will be most
convenient to consider the major Premiss

as being, “ all good reasoners are candid,"
(which of course is precisely equipollent to its

illative converse by negation;) and the minor
Premiss and Conclusion may in like manner be
fairly expressed thus—“most infidels are not
candid; therefore most infidels are not good
reasoners:” which is a regular Syllogism in

Camestres. Or, if you would state it in the first

for “guiding the judgment;” and fancying or
professing themselves successful in this, have
consistently enough denominated Logic, the
“Art of using the Reason;” which in truth it
would be, and would supersede all other studies,
if it could of itself ascertain the meaning of every

Term, and the truth or falsity of every Propo
sition, in the same manner as it actually can,
the validity of every Argument. And they have
been led into this, partly by the consideration
that Logic is concerned about the three opera
tions of the mind—simple Apprehension, Judg

ment, and Reasoning; not observing that it is
not equally concerned about all : the last
operation being alone its appropriate province;

and the rest being treated of only in reference
to that.

The contempt justly due to such pretensions
has most unjustly fallen on the Science itself;
much in the same manner as Chemistry was

brought into disrepute among the unthinking

SYNTHETICAL COMPENDIUM.

129

by the extravagant pretensions of the Alchy
mists. And those Logical writers have been
censured, not (as they should have been) for
making such professions, but for not fulfilling
them. It has been objected, especially, that the
rules of Logic leave us still at a loss as to the

most important and difficult point in Reason
ing; viz. the ascertaining the sense of the terms
employed, and removing their ambiguity. A
complaint resembling that made (according to
a story told by Warburton in his Div. Leg.,
and before alluded to) by a man who found
fault with all the reading-glasses presented to

him by the shopkeeper; the fact being that
he had never learnt to read.

In the present

case, the complaint is the more unreasonable,
inasmuch as there neither is, nor ever can possi
bly be, any such system devised as will effect
the proposed object of clearing up the ambi
guity of Terms. It is, however, no small ad
vantage, that the rules of Logic, though they
cannot, alone, ascertain and clear up ambiguity

in any Term, yet do point out in which Term
of an Argument it is to be sought for; direct
ing our attention to the middle Term, as the
one on the ambiguity of which a Fallacy is
likely to be built.

It will be useful, however, to class and de
scribe the different kinds of ambiguity which
are to be met with ; and also the various ways

in which the insertion of false, or, at least,
unduly assumed, Premises, is most likely to

elude observation. And though the remarks

which will be offered on these points may not
be considered as strictly forming a part of

Logic, they cannot be thought out of place,
when it is considered how essentially they are
connected with the application of it.

131

CHAPTER III.
OF FALLACHES.

Introduction.

By a Fallacy is commonly understood, “any ºn
ºf
y
unsound mode of arguing, which appears to
demandour conviction, and to be decisive of the
question in hand, when in fairness it is not.”

Considering the ready detection and clear expo
sure of Fallacies to be both more extensivelyim
portant, and also more difficult, than many are
aware of, we propose to take a Logical view

of the subject; referring the different Fallacies
to the most convenient heads, and giving a
scientific analysis of the procedure which takes
place in each.

After all, indeed, in the practical detection
of each individual Fallacy, much must depend
on natural and acquired acuteness; nor can
any rules be given, the mere learning of which
will enable us to apply them with mechanical
certainty and readiness: but still we shall find
that to take correct general views of the sub
ject, and to be familiarized with scientific dis
cussions of it, will tend, above all things, to

engender such a habit of mind, as will best fit us
for practice.
Indeed the case is the same with respect to
Logic in general; scarcely any one would, in

ordinary practice, state to himself either his
own or another's reasoning, in Syllogisms in
Barbara at full length; yet a familiarity with

Logical principles tends very much (as all
feel, who are really well acquainted with them)
to beget a habit of clear and sound reasoning.
The truth is, in this, as in many other things,
there are processes going on in the mind (when
we are practising anything quite familiar to
us) with such rapidity as to leave no trace in
the memory; and we often apply principles
which did not, as far as we are conscious, even
occur to us at the time.

purpose, to investigate fully the manner in

which certain studies operate in remotely pro
ducing certain effects on the mind: it is suffi
cient to establish the fact, that habits of scien

tific analysis (besides the intrinsic beauty and
dignity of such studies) lead to practical ad
vantage. It is on Logical principles therefore
that we propose to discuss the subject of Fal
lacies; and it may, indeed, seem to have been
unnecessary to make any apology for so doing,
after what has been formerly said, generally,
in defence of Logic; but that the generality of

OF EALLACIES.

133

Logical writers have usually followed so op
posite a plan: whenever they have to treat of
anything that is beyond the mere elements of
Logic, they totally lay aside all reference to
the principles they have been occupied in esta
blishing and explaining, and have recourse to

a loose, vague, and popular kind of language;
such as would be the best suited indeed to an

exoterical discourse, but seems strangely incon
gruous in a professed Logical treatise. What
should we think of a Geometrical writer, who,
after having gone through the elements with
strict definitions and demonstrations, should,

on proceeding to mechanics, totally lay aside all
reference to scientific principles, all use of
technical terms, and treat of the subject in
undefined terms, and with probable and popu

lar arguments

It would be thought strange,

if even a Botanist, when addressing those whom

he had been instructing in the principles and
the terms of his system, should totally lay these
aside when he came to describe plants, and

adopt the language of the vulgar. Surely it
affords but too much plausibility to the cavils
of those who scoff at Logic altogether, that the

very writers who profess to teach it, should
never themselves make any application of, or

reference to, its principles, on those very occa
sions, when, and when only, such application
and reference are to be expected. If the prin

134

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

ciples of any system are well laid down, if its
technical language is judiciously framed,
then, surely, those principles and that language
will afford (for those who have once tho

roughly learned them) the best, the most clear,
simple, and concise method of treating any
subject connected with that system. Yet even
the accurate Aldrich, in treating of the Di
lemma and of the Fallacies, has very much for

gotten the Logician, and assumed a loose and
rhetorical style of writing, without making any
application of the principles he had formerly
laid down, but, on the contrary, sometimes de

parting widely from them.*
The most experienced teachers, when ad

dressing those who are familiar with the ele
mentary principles of Logic, think it requisite,
not indeed to lead them, on each occasion,

through the whole detail of those principles,
when the process is quite obvious, but always
to put them on the road, as it were, to those

principles, that they may plainly see their own
* He is far more confused in his discussion of Fallacies

than in any other part of his treatise; of which this one
instance may serve; after having distinguished Fallacies
into those in the expression, and those in the matter (“ in

dictione,” and “extra dictionem”), he observes of one or
two of these last, that they are not properly called Falla
cies, as not being Syllogisms faulty in form (“Syllogismi
forma peccantes,”) as if any one which was such, could be

way to the end, and take a scientific view of
the subject: in the same manner as mathema
tical writers avoid indeed the occasional te

diousness of going all through a very simple
demonstration, which the learner, if he will,
may easily supply; but yet always speak in
strict mathematical language, and with refer

ence to mathematical principles, though they
do not always state them at full length. I
would not profess, therefore, any more than

they do, to write (on subjects connected with
the science) in a language intelligible to those
who are ignorant of its first rudiments; to do
so, indeed, would imply that one was not tak

ing a scientific view of the subject, nor availing
one's-self of the principles that had been esta
blished, and the accurate and concise technical

language that had been framed.
§. 1.

The division of Fallacies into those in the pººr
words IN DICTIONE, and those in the mat

ter EXTRA DICTIONEM, has not been, by
any writers hitherto, grounded on any distinct
principle; at least, not on any that they have
themselves adhered to. The confounding to
gether, however, of these two classes is highly
detrimental to all clear notions concerning

Logic; being obviously allied to the prevailing
erroneous views which make Logic the art of

136

employing the intellectual faculties in general,
having the discovery of truth for its object, and
all kinds of knowledge for its proper subject
matter; with all that train of vague and ground
less speculations which have led to such inter
minable confusion and mistakes, and afforded

a pretext for such clamorous censures.
It is important, therefore, that rules should

be given for a division of Fallacies into Logi
cal, and Non-logical, on such a principle as
shall keep clear of all this indistinctness and
perplexity.
If any one should object, that the division
about to be adopted is in some degree arbi
trary, placing under the one head Fallacies,
which many might be disposed to place under
the other, let him consider not only the indis
tinctness of all former divisions, but the utter

impossibility of framing any that shall be com
pletely secure from the objection urged, in a
case where men have formed such various and

vague notions, from the very want of some
clear principle of division. Nay, from the
elliptical form in which all reasoning is usually
expressed, and the peculiarly involved and
oblique form in which Fallacy is for the most
part conveyed, it must of course be often a
matter of doubt, or rather, of arbitrary choice,

not only to which genus each kind of Fallacy
should be referred, but even to which kind to

*

OF FALLACIES.

137

refer any one individual Fallacy: for since, in
any course of Argument, one

Premiss is usually

suppressed, it frequently happens, in the case
of a Fallacy, that the hearers are left to the al
ternative of supplying either a Premiss which
is not true, or else, one which does not prove the

Conclusion; e. g. if a man expatiates on the
distress of the country, and thence argues that
the government is tyrannical, we must suppose
him to assume either that “every distressed
country is under a tyranny,” which is a mani
fest falsehood, or, merely that “every country

under a tyranny is distressed,” which, however
true, proves nothing, the Middle Term being
undistributed.

Now, in the former case, the

Fallacy would be referred to the head of
“extra dictionem ;” in the latter to that of

“in dictione:” which are we to suppose the
speaker meant us to understand? Surely just
whichever each of his hearers might happen to
prefer: some might assent to the false Premiss;
others, allow the unsound Syllogism: to the

Sophist himself it is indifferent, as long as they
can but be brought to admit the Conclusion.
Without pretending, then, to conform to

every one's mode of speaking on the subject,
or to lay down rules which shall be in them
selves (without any call for labour or skill in
the person who employs them) readily applica

ble to, and decisive on each individual case, I

propose a division which is at least perfectly
clear in its main principle, and coincides, per
haps, as nearly as possible with the established

notions of Logicians on the subject.
§. 2.

ſocial rºl.

"

In every Fallacy, the Conclusion either does,

or does not follow from the Premises, Where
the Conclusion does not follow from the Pre

mises, it is manifest that the fault is in the Rea

soning, and in that alone; these, therefore, we
call Logical Fallacies,” as being, properly, vio
lations of those rules of Reasoning which it is
the province of Logic to lay down.

Of these, however, one kind are more purely
Logical, as exhibiting their fallaciousness by
the bare form of the expression, without any

regard to the meaning of the Terms: to which

mative Conclusion from a negative Premiss,
and vice versa: to which may be added, 4th.

those which have palpably (i. e. expressed)
more than three Terms.

The other kind may be most properly called
semi-logical; viz. all the cases of ambiguous
middle Term except its non-distribution: for
though in such cases the Conclusion does not

139

follow, and though the rules of Logic show
that it does not, as soon as the ambiguily of

the middle Term is ascertained, yet the discovery
and ascertainment of this ambiguity requires
attention to the sense of the term, and know
ledge of the Subject matter; so that here,

Logic “teaches us not how to find the Fallacy,
but only where to search for it,” and on what
principles to condemn it.
Accordingly it has been made a subject of
bitter complaint against Logic, that it presup
poses the most difficult point to be already ac
complished, viz. the sense of the Terms to be
ascertained.

A similar objection might be

urged against every other art in existence;
e.g. against Agriculture, that all the precepts
for the cultivation of land presuppose the
possession of a farm ; or against Perspective,
that its rules are useless to a blind man.

The

objection is indeed peculiarly absurd when
urged against Logic, because the object which
it is blamed for not accomplishing cannot pos
sibly be within the province of any one art
whatever.

Is it indeed possible or conceivable

that there should be any method, science, or
system, that should enable one to know the
full and exact meaning of every Term in exist

ence? The utmost that can be done is to give
some general rules that may assist us in this

140

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

work; which is done in the first two parts of
Logic.

-

The very author of the objection says, “This
(the comprehension of the meaning of general
Terms) is a study which every individual must
carry on for himself; and of which no rules of
Logic (how useful soever they may be in di
recting our labours) can supersede the neces
sity.” D. Stewart, Phil. vol. ii. ch. ii. s. 2.
Nothing perhaps tends more to conceal from
men their imperfect conception of the meaning
of a term, than the circumstance of their being
able fully to comprehend a process of reasoning
in which it is involved, without attaching any
distinct meaning at all to that Term; as is evi
dent when XYZ are used to stand for Terms,

in a regular Syllogism: thus a man may be

familiarized with a Term, and never find himself
at a loss from not comprehending it; from
which he will be very likely to infer that he
does comprehend it, when perhaps he does not,
but employs it vaguely and incorrectly; which

leads to fallacious Reasoning and confusion.
It must be owned, however, that many Logical
writers have, in great measure, brought on

themselves the reproach in question, by calling
Logic “the right use of Reason,” laying down
“rules for gaining clear ideas,” and such-like

2x2&ysia, as Aristotle calls it. (Rhet. book i.
ch. ii.)

OF FALLACIES.

141

§. 3.

The remaining class (viz. where the Con-Mºura.
clusion does follow from the Premises) may be

called the Material, or Non-logical Fallacies:
of these there are two kinds; *1st. when the

Premises are such as ought not to have been
assumed; 2d. when the Conclusion is not the

one required, but irrelevant; which Fallacy is
called “ignoratio elemchi,” because your Argu
ment is not the “elenchus” (i. e. proof of the

contradictory) of your opponent's assertion,
which it should be ; but proves, instead of
that, some other proposition resembling it.
Hence, since Logic defines what Contradiction
is, some may choose rather to range this with
the Logical Fallacies, as it seems, so far, to
come under the jurisdiction of that art; never
theless, it is perhaps better to adhere to the

original division, both on account of its clear
ness, and also because few would be inclined to
apply to the Fallacy in question the accusation

of being inconclusive, and consequently illogical
Reasoning: besides which, it seems an artificial
and circuitous way of speaking, to suppose in
all cases an opponent and a contradiction ; the
simple statement of the matter being this, -I
* For it is manifest that the fault, if there be any, must

be either 1st. in the Premises, or 2dly. in the Conclusion,
or 3dly, in the Connection between them.

142

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

am required, by the circumstances of the case,
(no matter why) to prove a certain Conclusion;
I prove, not that, but one which is likely to
be mistaken for it;—in this lies the Fallacy.
It might be desirable therefore to lay aside

the name of “ignoratio elemchi,” but that it is so
generally adopted as absolutely to require some
mention to be made of it.

The other kind of

Fallacies in the Matter will comprehend (as far
as the vague and obscure language of Logical
writers will allow us to conjecture) the Fallacy

of “non causa pro causa,” and that of “petitio
principii:" of these, the former is by them dis
tinguished into “a non cera pro cera,” and “a
non tali pro tali;” this last would appear to be
arguing from a case not parallel as if it were so ;

which, in Logical language, is, having the sup
pressed Premiss false; for it is in that the pa
rallelism is affirmed; and the “non vera pro
vera” will in like manner signify the expressed
Premiss being false; so that this Fallacy will
turn out to be, in plain terms, neither more

nor less than falsity (or unfair assumption) of
a Premiss.

The remaining kind, “petitio principii,”
(begging the question,) takes place when a Pre
miss, whether true or false, is either plainly
equivalent to the Conclusion, or depends on it
for its own reception. It is to be observed,

however, that in all correct Reasoning the Pre

OF FALLACIES.

143

mises must, virtually, imply the Conclusion; so
that it is not possible to mark precisely the dis

tinction between the Fallacy in question and
fair Argument; since that may be correct and
fair Reasoning to one person, which would be,
to another, “begging the question;” sinceto one,
the Conclusion might be more evident than the
Premiss, and to the other, the reverse. The

most plausible form of this Fallacy is arguing
in a circle ; and the greater the circle, the
harder to detect.

§. 4.

There is no Fallacy that may not properly
be included under some of the foregoing heads:

§. 5.
On each of the Fallacies which have been

thus enumerated and distinguished, I propose
to offer some more particular remarks: but

before I proceed to this, it will be proper to
premise two general observations, 1st. on the

importance, and 2d. the difficulty, of detecting
and describing Fallacies; both have been al

ready slightly alluded to; but it is requisite

that they should here be somewhat more fully
and distinctly set forth.
1st. It seems by most persons to be taken

for granted that a Fallacy is to be dreaded important.
merely as a weapon fashioned and wielded by #.”
a skilful sophist: or if they allow that a man
may with honest intentions slide into one
unconsciously, in the heat of argument, still
they seem to suppose that where there is no

dispute, there is no cause to dread Fallacy;
whereas there is much danger, even in what

may be called solitary reasoning, of sliding un
awares into some Fallacy, by which one may
be so far deceived as even to act upon the
conclusion thus obtained. By solitary rea
soning I mean the case in which one is not
seeking for arguments to prove a given question,
but labouring to elicit from one's previous

stock of knowledge some useful inference.* To

select one from innumerable examples that
might be cited, and of which some more will
occur in the subsequent part of this essay; it is
not improbable that many indifferent sermons

have been produced by the ambiguity of the
word “plain:" a young divine perceives the
truth of the maxim, that “for the lower orders

one's language cannot be too plain ; (i.e. clear
and perspicuous, so as to require no learning
nor ingenuity to understand it,) and when he
proceeds to practice, the word “plain” indis
tinctly flits before him, as it were, and often
checks him in the use of ornaments of style,
such as metaphor, epithet, antithesis, &c.,
which are opposed to “plainness” in a totally

different sense of the word; being by no means
necessarily adverse to perspicuity, but rather,
in many cases, conducive to it; as may be seen
in several of the clearest of our Lord's dis

courses, which are the very ones that are the
most richly adorned with figurative language.
So far indeed is an ornamented style from
being unfit for the vulgar, that they are pleased
with it even in excess.

Yet the desire to be

“ plain,” combined with that dim and confused

notion which the ambiguity of the word pro
duces in such as do not separate in their minds,
and set before themselves, the two meanings,

often causes them to write in a dry and bald
style, which has no advantage in point of per

OF FALLACIES.

147

spicuity, and is least of all suited to the taste of
the vulgar. The above instance is not drawn

from mere conjecture, but from actual experi
ence of the fact.

Another instance of the strong influence of ºt
words on our ideas may be adduced from a "*

widely different subject: most persons feel a
certain degree of surprise on first hearing of the
result of some late experiments of the Agricul
tural Chemists, by which they have ascertained
that universally what are called heavy soils are

specifically the lightest; and vice versá; whence
this surprise 2 for no one ever distinctly believed
the established names to be used in the literal

and primary sense, in consequence of the re

spective soils having been weighed together;
indeed it is obvious on a moment's reflection

that tenacious clay-soils (as well as muddy roads)
are figuratively called heavy, from the difficulty

of ploughing, , or passing over them, which
produces an effect like that of bearing or drag
ging a heavy weight; yet still the terms
“light” and “heavy,” though used figuratively,
have most undoubtedly introduced into men's
minds something of the ideas expressed by

them in their primitive sense. The same words
when applied to articles of diet, have produced

important errors; many supposing some arti
cle of food to be light of digestion, from its
being specifically light. So true is the inge
L2

148

nious observation of Hobbes, that “words

are the counters of wise men, and the money
of fools.”*

* “Men imagine,” says Bacon, “that their minds have
the command of Language; but it oftenhappens that Lan
guage bears rule over their mind.” Some of the weak and
absurd arguments which are often urged against Suicide
may be traced to the influence of words on thoughts.
When a Christian moralist is called on for a direct Scrip

tural precept against suicide, instead of replying that the
Bible is not meant for a complete code of laws, but for a

system of motives and principles, the answer frequently
given is “thou shalt do no murder;” and it is assumed
in the arguments drawn from Reason, as well as in those

from Revelation, that Suicide is a species of murder; viz.
because it is called self-murder; and thus, deluded by a
name, many are led to rest on an unsound argument,
which, like all other fallacies, does more harm than good,
in the end, to the cause of truth. Suicide, if any one con
siders the nature and not the name of it, evidently wants
the most essential characteristic of murder; viz. the hurt
and injury done to one's neighbour, in depriving him of
life, as well as to others by the insecurity they are in con
sequence liable to feel. And since no one can, strictly
speaking, do injustice to himself, he cannot, in the literal
and primary acceptation of the words, be said either to rob

or to murder himself. He who deserts the post to which
he is appointed by his great Master, and presumptuously
cuts short the state of probation graciously allowed him for
working out his salvation, (whether by action or by patient
endurance,) is guilty indeed of a grievous sin, but of one
not the least analogous in its character to murder. It im

plies no inhumanity. It is much more closely allied to
the sin of wasting life in indolence, or in trifling pursuits,
—that life which is bestowed as a seed-time for the harvest

of immortality. What is called in familiar phrase “killing
time,” is, in truth, an approach, as far as it goes, to the
destruction of one's own life: for “Time is the stuff life is
made of.”

More especially deserving of attention is the

influence of Analogical Terms in leading men
into erroneous notions in Theology; where the
most important terms are analogical; and yet,
they are continually employed in Reasoning,
without due attention (oftener through want
of caution than by unfair design) to their
analogical nature; and most of the errors into
which theologians have fallen may be traced,
in part, to this cause.*
Thus much, as to the extensive practical
influence of Fallacies, and the consequent

high importance of detecting and exposing
them.

It is surely wiser and safer to confine ourselves to such
arguments as will bear the test of a close examination, than
to resort to such as may indeed at the first glance be more

specious and appear stronger, but which when exposed,
will too often leave a man a dupe to the fallacies on the
opposite side. But it is especially the error of controver

up the first weapon that comes to hand; (“furor arma

more likely to obtain reception, the more it is
obscured and disguised by obliquity and com

plexity of expression: it is thus that it is the
most likely either to slip accidentally from the
careless reasoner, or to be brought forward

deliberately by the Sophist. Not that he ever
wishes that obscurity and complexity to be
perceived; on the contrary, it is for his pur

pose that the expression should appear as clear
and simple as possible, while in reality it is the
most tangled net he can contrive. Thus,

whereas it is usual to express our reasoning
elliptically, so that a Premiss (or even two or

three entire steps in a course of argument)
which may be readily supplied, as being per
fectly obvious, shall be left to be understood,
the Sophist in like manner suppresses what is

not obvious, but is in reality the weakest part
of the argument; and uses every other contri
vance to withdraw our attention (his art closely
resembling the juggler's) from the quarter
where the Fallacy lies. Hence the uncertainty
before mentioned, to which class any indivi
dual Fallacy is to be referred : and hence it is

that the difficulty of detecting and exposing
Fallacy, is so much greater than that of com
prehending and developing a process of sound
argument. It is like the detection and appre
hension of a criminal in spite of all his arts of
concealment and disguise; when this is accom

plished, and he is brought to trial with all the
evidence of his guilt produced, his conviction
and punishment are easy; and this is precisely
the case with those Fallacies which are given
as examples in Logical treatises; they are in

fact already detected, by being stated in a plain
and regular form, and are, as it were, only
brought up to receive sentence. Or again, fal
lacious reasoning may be compared to a per
plexed and entangled mass of accounts, which

it requires much sagacity and close attention
to clear up, and display in a regular and intel
ligible form; though when this is once accom

plished, the whole appears so perfectly simple,
that the unthinking are apt to undervalue

the skill and pains which have been employed
upon it.

-

Moreover, it should be remembered that a

very long discussion is one of the most effec
tual veils of Fallacy; sophistry, like poison, is
at once detected, and nauseated when presented

to us in a concentrated form; but a Fallacy
which when stated barely, in a few sentences,
would not deceive a child, may deceive half the

world if diluted in a quarto volume. For, as
in a calculation, one single figure incorrectly
stated will enable us to arrive at any result
whatever, though every other figure, and the
whole of the operations, be correct, so, a single

false assumption in any process of reasoning,

152

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

though every other be true, will enable us to
draw what conclusion we please; and the

greater the number of true assumptions, the
more likely it is that the false one will pass
unnoticed.* But when you single out one

step in the course of the reasoning, and exhi
bit it as a Syllogism with one Premiss true and
the other false, the sophistry is easily per
ceived. To speak, therefore, of all the Falla
cies that have ever been enumerated as too

glaring and obvious to need even being men
tioned, because the simple instances given in
logical treatises, and there stated in the plainest

and consequently most easily detected form,
are such as would (in that form) deceive no
one;—this, surely, shows either extreme weak

slipped in, as it were incidentally, that a given quantity of

ness, or else unfairness. It may readily be al
lowed, indeed, that to detect individual Falla

cies, and bring them under the general rules, is
a harder task than to lay down those general
rules; but this does not prove that the latter

office is trifling or useless, or that it does not
essentially conduce to the performance of the

other: there may be more ingenuity shown in
detecting and arresting a malefactor, and con
victing him of the fact, than in laying down a

law for the trial and punishment of such per
sons; but the latter office, i. e. that of a legis
lator, is surely neither unnecessary nor trifling.
It should be added that a close observation

and Logical analysis of Fallacious arguments,
as it tends (according to what has been already
said) to form a habit of mind well suited for

the practical detection of Fallacies; so, for
that very reason, it will make us the more

careful in making allowance for them : i. e. to
bear in mind how much men in general are

liable to be influenced by them. E.G. a refuted
argument ought to go for nothing ; but in fact
it will generally prove detrimental to the cause,
from the Fallacy which will be presently ex
plained. Now, no one is more likely to be prac
tically aware of this, and to take precautions

accordingly, than he who is most versed in the
whole theory of Fallacies; for the best Logi

cian is the least likely to calculate on men in
general being such.

Of Fallacies in form.
§. 7.

Enough has already been said in the pre
ceding compendium ;

and it has been re

marked above, that it is often left to our

choice to refer an individual Fallacy to this
head or to another.

To the present class we may the most con
veniently refer those Fallacies, so common in
practice, of supposing the conclusion false, be
cause the Premiss is false, or because the ar

gument is unsound; and inferring the truth of

the Premiss from that of the Conclusion; e.g.
if any one argues for the existence of a God,
from its being universally believed, a man
might perhaps be able to refute the argument
by producing an instance of some nation des
titute of such belief; the argument ought then

(as has been observed above) to go for nothing:
but many would go further, and think that
this refutation had disproved the existence of a

God; in which they would be guilty of an illi
cit process of the major term; viz. “whatever
is universally believed must be true; the exist
ence of a God is not universally believed;

OF FALLACIES.

155

therefore it is not true.” Others again from

being convinced of the truth of the conclusion
would infer that of the Premises; which would

amount to the Fallacy of an undistributed mid
dle: viz. “what is universally believed, is
true; the existence of a God is true; therefore

it is universally believed.”

Or, these Fallacies

might be stated in the hypothetical form ;
since the one evidently proceeds from the de
nial of the antecedent to the denial of the con

sequent: and the other from the establishing
of the consequent to the inferring of the ante
cedent; which two Fallacies will often be

found to correspond respectively with those of
Illicit process of the major, and Undistributed
middle.

Fallacies of this class are very much kept

out of sight, being seldom perceived even by
those who employ them; but of their practi
cal importance there can be no doubt, since it

is notorious that a weak argument is always,
in practice, detrimental; and that there is no
absurdity so gross which men will not readily
admit, if it appears to lead to a conclusion of
what they are already convinced. Even a

candid and sensible writer is not unlikely to
be, by this means, misled, when he is seeking
for arguments to support a conclusion which
he has long been fully convinced of himself;

156

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

i. e. he will often use such arguments as would
never have convinced himself, and are not likely
to convince others, but rather (by the opera
tion of the converse Fallacy) to confirm in
their dissent those who before disagreed with
him.

It is best therefore to endeavour to put

yourself in the place of an opponent to your
own arguments, and consider whether you
could not find some objection to them. The
applause of one's own party is a very unsafe

ground for judging of the real force of an ar
gumentative work, and consequently of its
real utility. To satisfy those who were doubt
ing, and to convince those who were opposed,
are the only sure tests; but these persons are

seldom very loud in their applause, or very for
ward in bearing their testimony.
Of Ambiguous middle.
§. 8.
That case in which the middle is undistri

buted, belongs of course to the preceding head,
the fault being perfectly manifest from the

mere form of the expression: in that case the
extremes are compared with two parts of the

same term ; but in the Fallacy which has been
called semi-logical, (which we are now to

OF FALLACIES.

157

speak of) the extremes are compared with two
different terms, the middle being used in two
different senses in the two Premises.*

And here it may be remarked, that when
the argument is brought into the form of a
regular Syllogism, the contrast between these

two senses will usually appear very striking,
from the two Premises being placed together;
and hence the scorn with which many have
treated the very mention of the Fallacy of

Equivocation, deriving their only notion of it
from the exposure of it in Logical treatises;
whereas, in practice it is common for the two
Premises to be placed very far apart, and dis

cussed in different parts of the discourse; by
which means the inattentive hearer overlooks

any ambiguity that may exist in the middle
term. Hence the advantage of Logical habits,
to fix our attention strongly and steadily on
the important terms of an argument.
One case which may be regarded as coming
under the head of Ambiguous middle, is, what
is called “Fallacia Figura Dictionis,” the Fal
lacy built on the grammatical structure of lan
guage, from men's usually taking for granted that
paronymous words (i.e. those belonging to each
other, as the substantive, adjective, verb, &c.
of the same root) have a precisely corre
* For some instances of important ambiguities, see Ap
pendix.

158

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

spondent meaning; which is by no means uni
versally the case. Such a Fallacy could not
indeed be even exhibited in strict Logical
form, which would preclude even the attempt
at it, since it has two middle terms in sound as

well as sense: but nothing is more common
in practice than to vary continually the terms

employed, with a view to grammatical con
nience; nor is there anything unfair in such a
practice, as long as the meaning is preserved
unaltered: e.g. “murder should be punished
with death; this man is a murderer; therefore

he deserves to die,” &c. &c. Here we proceed
on the assumption (in this case just) that to
commit murder and to be a murderer, to de

serve death and to be one who ought to die,
are, respectively, equivalent expressions: and
it would frequently prove a heavy inconve
nience to be debarred this kind of liberty; but
the abuse of it gives rise to the Fallacy in
question: e.g. projectors are unfit to be
trusted; this man has formed a project, there
fore he is unfit to be trusted:* here the Sophist

proceeds on the hypothesis that he who forms
a project must be a projector: whereas the bad
sense that commonly attaches to the latter

word, is not at all implied in the former.
This Fallacy may often be considered as
* Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations: Usury.

159

OF FALLACIES.

lying not in the middle, but in one of the terms
of the conclusion; so that the conclusion

drawn shall not be, in reality, at all warranted

by the Premises, though it will appear to be
so, by means of the grammatical affinity of the
words: e.g. “to be acquainted with the guilty
is a presumption of guilt; this man is so ac
quainted; therefore we may presume that he is
guilty:" this argument proceeds on the suppo
sition of an exact correspondence between
“ presume” and “presumption,” which, how
ever, does not really exist; for “presumption”

it commonly used to express a kind of slight
suspicion; whereas “to presume” amounts to
absolute belief.
The above remark will apply to some other

cases of ambiguity of term; viz. the conclusion
will often contain a term, which (though not
as here, different in expression from the cor

responding one in the Premiss, yet) is liable to
be understood in a sense different from what it

bears to the Premiss; though, of course, such
a Fallacy is less common, because less likely to
deceive, in those cases, than in this ; where the

term used in the conclusion, though professing
to correspond with one in the Premiss, is not
the very same in expression, and therefore is

more certain to convey a different sense; which
is what the Sophist wishes.

-

There are innumerable instances of a non

160

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

correspondence in paronymous words, similar
to that above instanced ; as between art and

artful, design and designing, faith and faithful,
&c.; and the more slight the variation of

meaning, the more likely is the Fallacy to be
successful; for when the words have become

so widely removed in sense as “pity” and

“pitiful,” every one would perceive such a Fal
lacy, nor could it be employed but in jest.
This Fallacy cannot in practice be refuted,

by stating merely the impossibility of reducing
such an argument to the strict Logical form;
(unless indeed you are addressing regular Lo

gicians) you mustfind some way of pointing out
the non-correspondence of the terms in ques
tion; e.g. with respect to the example above,
it might be remarked, that we speak of strong
or faint “presumption,” but we use no such
expression in conjunction with the verb “pre
sume,” because the word itself implies strength.
No Fallacy is more common in controversy
than the present, since in this way the Sophist
will often be able to misinterpret the proposi
tions which his opponent admits or maintains,

and so employ them against him. Thus in the
examples just given, it is natural to conceive

one of the Sophist's Premises to have been
borrowed from his opponent.*
* Perhaps a dictionary of such paronymous words as do
mot regularly correspond in meaning, would be nearly as

OF FALLACIES.

I61

The present Fallacy is nearly allied to, or
rather perhaps may be regarded as a branch
of that founded on etymology; viz. when
a Term is used, at one time, in its customary,
and at another, in its etymological sense.
Perhaps no example of this can be found
that is more extensively and mischievously
employed than in the case of the word re

presentative: assuming that its right mean
ing must correspond exactly with the strict
and original sense of the verb, “represent,”
the Sophist persuades the multitude, that a
member of the House of Commons is bound to

be guided in all points by the opinion of his
constituents: and, in short, to be merely their
spokesman: whereas law and custom, which in
this case may be considered as fixing the mean
ing of the Term, require no such thing, but en
join the representative to act according to the
best of his own judgment, and on his own re
sponsibility.*
useful as one of synonyms; i. e. properly speaking, of
pseudo-synonyms.

* H. Tooke has furnished a whole magazine of such
weapons for any Sophist who may need them, and fur
nished some specimens of the employment of them.
He contends, that it is idle to speak of eternal or im
mutable “Truth,” because the word is derived from to

“trow,” i.e. believe. He might on as good grounds
have censured the absurdity of speaking of sending a let
ter by the “post,” because a post, in its primary sense, is
a pillar; or have insisted that “Sycophant” can never
mean anything but “Fig-shewer.”

called “Fallacia plurium Interrogationum,”
which may be named, simply, “the Fallacy of
Interrogation;” viz. the Fallacy of asking se
veral questions which appear to be but one ; so

that whatever one answer is given, being of
course applicable to one only of the implied
questions, may be interpreted as applied to the

other; the refutation is, of course, to reply se
parately to each question, i. e. to detect the
ambiguity.
I have said several “questions which appear

to be but one, for else there is no Fallacy; such
an example, therefore, as “estne homo animal et

lapis 2" which Aldrich gives, is foreign to the
matter in hand; for there is nothing unfair in

asking two distinct questions (any more than
in asserting two distinct propositions) dis
tinctly and avowedly.

This Fallacy may be referred, as has been
said, to the head of Ambiguous middle. In all
Reasoning it is very common to state one of
the Premises in form of a question, and when
that is admitted, or supposed to be admitted,
then to fill up the rest; if then one of the
Terms of that question be ambiguous, which
ever sense the opponent replies to, the Sophist

OF FALLACIES.

163

assumes the other sense of the Term in the re

maining Premiss. It is therefore very com
mon to state an equivocal argument, in form

of a question so worded, that there shall be
little doubt which reply will be given: but if
there be such doubt, the Sophist must have
two Fallacies of equivocation ready: e.g. the
question “whether anything vicious is expe
dient,” discussed in Cic. Off, book iii. (where,

by the by, he seems not a little perplexed with
it himself) is of the character in question, from

the ambiguity of the word “expedient,” which
means sometimes, “ conducive to temporal
prosperity,” sometimes, “ conducive to the
greatest good:” whichever answer therefore
was given, the Sophist might have a Fallacy
of equivocation founded on this term; viz. if

the answer be in the negative, his argument,
Logically developed, will stand thus, -“what
is vicious is not expedient; whatever conduces
to the acquisition of wealth and aggrandize
ment is expedient ; therefore it cannot be
vicious:” if in the affirmative, then thus,

whatever is expedient is desirable; something
vicious is expedient, therefore desirable.”

This kind of Fallacy is frequently employed
in such a manner, that the uncertainty shall

be, not about the meaning, but the extent of a
Term, i. e. whether it is distributed or not: e. g.
“did A B in this case act from such and such
M 2

164

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

a motive " which may imply either, “was it
his sole motive 2" or “was it one of his mo
tives 2" in the former case the term “ that

which—actuated-A B" is distributed; in the lat

ter, not : now if he acted from a mixture of
motives, whichever answer you give, may be

misrepresented, and thus disproved.
§. 10.
In some cases of ambiguous middle, the Term

in question may be considered as having in it
self, from its own equivocal nature, two signi
fications; (which apparently constitutes the
“Fallacia equivocationis” of Logical writers;)
others again have a middle Term which is am
biguous from the context, i. e. from what is
wnderstood in conjunction with it. This divi
sion will be found useful, though it is impos
sible to draw the line accurately in it. The
elliptical character of ordinary discourse causes
many Terms to become practically ambiguous,
which yet are not themselves employed in dif
ferentsenses, but with differentapplications, which
are understood.

Thus, “ The Faith” would be

used by a Christian writer to denote the Christian
Faith, and by a Mussulman, the Mahometan ;

yet the word Faith has not in these cases, of
itself, two different significations. So ºxexrot,
“ elect,” or “chosen,” is sometimes applied to
such as are “chosen,” to certain privileges and

165

advantages ; (as the Israelites were, though
“they were overthrown in the wilderness for
their disobedience; and as all Christians are

frequently called in the New Testament) some
times again to those who are “chosen,” as fit
to receive a final reward, having made a right

use of those advantages; as when our Lord
says, “many are called, but few chosen.”
There are various ways in which words
come to have two meanings: 1st. by accident;
(i. e. when there is no perceptible connection

between the two meanings) as “light” signi
* What Logicians have mentioned under the title of
“Fallacia amphibolicae” is referable to this last class;
though in real practice it is not very likely to occur. An
amphibolous sentence is one that is capable of two mean
ings, not from the double sense of any of the words, but
from its admitting of a double construction: as in the in
stance Aldrich gives, which is untranslatable; “quod tan
gitur a Socrate, illud sentit:” where “illud” may be
taken either as the nominative or accusative.

So also the

celebrated response of the oracle; “Aio te, AEacida, Ro
manos vincere posse:” which closely resembles (as Shak
spere remarks) the witch-prophecy, “The Duke yet lives
that Henry shall depose.” A similar effect is produced by
what the French call “construction louche,” a squinting

construction; i. e. where some word or words may be re
ferred either to the former or latter clause of the sentence;

of which an instance occurs in the rubric prefixed to the
service of the 30th January. “If this day shall happen to
be Sunday [this form of prayer shall be used] and the fast
kept the next day following:” the clause in brackets may
belong either to the former or the latter part of the sen
tence. In the Nicene Creed, the words “by whom all
things were made,” are grammatically referable either to
the Father or the Son.

fies both the contrary to “heavy,” and the

contrary to “dark.” Thus, such proper names
as John or Thomas, &c. which happen to be

long to several different persons, are ambiguous,
because they have a different signification in
each case where they are applied. Words which
fall under this first head are what are the most

strictly called equivocal.
2dly. There are several terms in the use of
which it is necessary to notice the distinction
between first and second intention.* The “first

intention” of a Term, (according to the usual
acceptation of this phrase) is a certain vague
and general signification of it, as opposed toº
one more precise and limited, which it bears in
some particular art, science, or system, and
* I am aware that there exists another opinion as to
the meaning of the phrase “second-intention;” and that
Aldrich is understood by some persons to mean (as indeed

his expression may very well be understood to imply) that
every predicable must necessarily be employed in the Se
cond-intention.

I do not undertake to combat the doc

trine alluded to, because I must confess that, after the

most patient attention devoted to the explanations given
of it, I have never been able to comprehend what it is that
is meant by it. It is one, however, which, whether sound

or unsound, appears not to be connected with any Logical
processes, and therefore may be safely passed by on the
present occasion.
For some remarks on the Second-intention of the word

“Species,” when applied to organized-beings (viz. as
denoting those plants or animals, which it is conceived
may have descended from a common stock) see the sub

joined Dissertation, Ch. v. §. 1.

167

OF FALLACIES.

which is called its “second-intention.” Thus,
among farmers, in some parts, the word

“beast" is applied particularly and especially
to the ox kind; and “bird,” in the language
of many sportsmen, is in like manner appro
priated to the partridge: the common and ge
neral acceptation (which every one is well ac

quainted with) of each of those two words, is
the First-intention of each; the other, its
Second-intention.

-

It is evident that a Term may have several

Second-intentions, according to the several sys
tems into which it is introduced, and of which
it is one of the technical Terms: thus “ line”

signifies, in the Art-military, a certain form
of drawing up ships or troops: in Geography,
a certain division of the earth; to the fisher

man, a string to catch fish, &c. &c.; all which
are so many distinct Second-intentions, in each

of which there is a certain signification “of
extension in length" which constitutes the First
intention, and which corresponds pretty nearly
with the employment of the Term in Mathe
matics.”

It will sometimes happen, that a Term shall

be employed always in some one or other of
* In a few instances the Second-intention, or philoso
phical employment of a Term is more ertensive than the
First-intention, or popular use: thus “affection” is limited
in popular use to “love:” and “flower,” to those which
have conspicuous petals.

168

its second intentions; and never, strictly, in
the first, though that first intention is a part of
its signification in each case. It is evident,
that the utmost care is requisite to avoid con
founding together, either the first and second
intentions, or the different second intentions
with each other.

nected by resemblance or analogy, they will
frequently have the same name. Thus a
“blade of grass,” and the contrivance in build
ing called a “ dove-tail,” are so called from
their resemblance to the blade” of a sword, and
the tail of a real dove. But two things may be
connected by analogy, though they have in
themselves no resemblance : for analogy is the
resemblance of ratios (or relations) thus, as
a sweet taste gratifies the palate, so does a sweet
sound gratify the ear; and hence the same
word, “sweet,” is applied to both, though no
flavour can resemble a sound in itself: so, the
leg of a table does not resemble that of an ani
mal; nor the foot of a mountain that of an

animal: but the leg answers the same purpose
to the table, as the leg of an animal to that
animal; the foot of a mountain has the same

169

situation relatively to the mountain, as the foot
of an animal, to the animal; this analogy
therefore may be expressed like a mathemati

cal analogy (or proportion) “leg : animal ::
supporting stick : table.”
In all these cases (of this 3d head) one of
the meanings of the word is called by Logi
cians proper, i. e. original or primary; the

other improper, secondary, or transferred:
thus, sweet is originally and properly applied

to tastes ; secondarily and improperly (i.e. by
analogy) to sounds: thus also, dove-tail is ap
plied secondarily (though not by analogy, but
by direct resemblance) to the contrivance in
building so called. When the secondary
meaning of a word is founded on some fanci
ful analogy, and especially when it is intro
duced for ornament sake, we call this a meta

phor; as when we speak of “a ship's plough
ing the deep.” The turning up of the surface
being essential indeed to the plough, but acci

dental only, to the ship ; but if the analogy be
a more important and essential one, and espe
cially if we have no other word to express our

meaning but this transferred one, we then call
it merely an analogous word (though the meta
phor is analogous also) e. g. one would
hardly call it metaphorical or figurative lan
guage to speak of the leg of a table, or mouth
of a river.

4thly. Several things may be called by the
same name (though they have no connection
of resemblance or analogy) from being con–

nected by vicinity of time or place; under which
head will come the connection of cause and

effect, or of part and whole, &c. Thus a door
signifies both an opening in the wall (more
strictly called the door-way) and a board which
closes it; which are things neither similar nor

analogous. When I say, “ the rose smells
sweet;” and “I smell the rose;” the word
“smell” has two meanings: in the latter sen

tence, I am speaking of a certain sensation in
my own mind; in the former, of a certain qua
lity in the flower, which produces that sensa
tion, but which of course cannot in the least
resemble it: and here the word smell is applied

with equal propriety to both. Thus we speak
of Homer, for “the works of Homer;” and
this is a secondary or transferred meaning:
and so it is when we say, “a good shot,” for a
good marksman; but the word “shot” has two
other meanings, which are both equally pro
per; viz. the thing put into a gun in order to

be discharged from it, and the act of discharg
ing it.

Thus, “learning" signifies either the act of
acquiring knowledge, or the knowledge itself;
e.g. “he neglects his learning;” “Johnson
was a man of learning.” “Possession” is ambi

guous in the same manner, and a multitude of
others.

-

Much confusion often arises from ambiguity
of this kind, when unperceived; nor is there
any point in which the copiousness and conse

quent precision of the Greek language, is more
to be admired than in its distinct terms for ex

pressing an act, and the result of that act; e.g.

apašis, “the doingofanything;"apayua, the thing
done ;” so, 30ms and 8wpov, Anvis and Anupa, &c.

It will very often happen, that two of the
meanings of a word will have no connection
with one another, but will each have some con

nection with a third. Thus “martyr" originally
signified a witness; thence it was applied to those
who suffered in bearing testimony to Christia

nity; and thence again it is often applied to
“sufferers" in general: the first and third signi
fications are not the least connected.

Thus

“post” signifies originally a pillar, (postum,
from pono) then a distance marked out by
posts; and then the carriages, messengers, &c.
that travelled over this distan...e.

Innumera

ble other ambiguities might be brought under
this fourth head, which indeed comprehends
all the cases which do not fall under the three
others.

The remedy for ambiguity is a Definition of

the Term which is suspected of being used in
two senses; viz, a Nominal, not necessarily a

pendium.

troversy, it is only requisite that the term
should be employed uniformly in the same
sense as far as the existing question is concerned;
thus, two persons might, in discussing the
question, whether Caesar was a GREAt man,
have some difference in their acceptation of the

epithet “great,” which would be non-essential
to that question; e.g. one of them might un
derstand by it nothing more than eminent in
tellectual and moral qualities ; while the other
might conceive it to imply the performance of
splendid actions : this abstract difference of
meaning would not produce any disagreement

in the existing question, because both those
circumstances are united in the case of Caesar;

but if one (and not the other) of the parties
understood the epithet “great” to imply pure
patriotism, GENERosity of character, &c. then
there would be a disagreement as to the appli
cation of the Term, even between those who

might think alike of Caesar's character. De
finition, the specific for ambiguity, is to be
employed, and demanded, with a view to this
principle; it is sufficient on each occasion to

define a Term as far as regards the question in
hand.

OF FALLACIES.

§. 11.

Of those cases where the ambiguity arises
jrom the context, there are several species; some
of which Logicians have enumerated, but have
neglected to refer them, in the first place, to
one common class (viz. the one under which

they are here placed;) and have even arranged
some under the head of Fallacies “in dictione,”
and others under that of “extra dictionem.”

We may consider, as the first of these spe-fill.
cies, the Fallacy of “Division” and that of *
“Composition,” taken together, since in each
of these the middle Term is used in one Pre

miss collectively, in the other, distributively: if
the former of these is the major Premiss, and
the latter, the minor, this is called the “Fal

lacy of Division;” the Term which is first
taken collectively being afterwards divided;

and vice versá. The ordinary examples are
such as these; “All the angles of a triangle
are equal to two right angles: A B C is an
angle of a triangle ; therefore A B C is equal
to two right angles.” “Five is one number;
three and two are five; therefore three and two
are one number;" or, “three and two are two

numbers, five is three and two, therefore five is
two numbers:" it is manifest that the middle

Term, three and two (in this last example) is

ambiguous, signifying, in the major Premiss

174

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

“taken distinctly,” in the minor, “taken toge
ther:” and so of the rest.

To this head may be referred the Fallacy by
which men have sometimes been led to admit,

or pretend to admit, the doctrine of Necessity ;
e.g. “he who necessarily goes or stays (i. e.
in reality, “who necessarily goes, or who neces

sarily stays') is not a free agent; you must ne
cessarily go or stay (i. e. “you must necessa
rily take the alternative') therefore you are not

a free agent.” Such also is the Fallacy which
probably operates on most adventurers in lot
teries; e.g. “the gaining of a high prize is
no uncommon occurrence ; and what is no un

common occurrence may reasonably be ex
pected ; therefore the gaining of a high prize
may reasonably be expected :” the Conclusion,
when applied to the individual (as in practice
it is), must be understood in the sense of “rea
sonably expected by a certain individual;” there
fore for the major Premiss to be true the mid
dle Term must be understood to mean, “no
uncommon occurrence to some one particular
person ;” whereas for the minor (which has

been placed first) to be true, you must under
stand it of “no uncommon occurrence to

some one or other;" and thus you will have the
Fallacy of Composition.
There is no Fallacy more common, or more
likely to deceive, than the one now before us:

-

OF FALLACIES.

175

the form in which it is most usually employed,
is, to establish some truth, separately, concern
ing each single member of a certain class, and
thence to infer the same of the whole collec

tively : thus some infidels have laboured to
prove concerning some one of our Lord's mi

racles, that it might have been the result of
an accidental conjuncture of natural circum
stances; next, they endeavour to prove the
same concerning another; and so on; and

thence infer that all of them might have been
so. They might argue in like manner, that

because it is not very improbable one may
throw sixes in any one out of a hundred
throws, therefore it is no more improbable that
one may throw sixes a hundred times run
ning.
This Fallacy may often be considered as
turning on the ambiguity of the word “all;”
which may easily be dispelled by substituting
for it the word “each” or “every,” where that
is its signification; e.g. “all these trees make
a thick shade,” is ambiguous, meaning, either,
“every one of them,” or “all together.”
This is a Fallacy with which men are ex
tremely apt to deceive themselves: for when a
multitude of particulars are presented to the
mind, many are too weak or too indolent to
take a comprehensive view of them; but con
fine their attention to each single point, by

176

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

turns; and then decide, infer, and act, accord

ingly: e. g. the imprudent spendthrift, finding
that he is able to afford this, or that, or the

other expense, forgets that all of them together
will ruin him.

-

To the same head may be reduced that falla
cious reasoning by which men vindicate them
selves to their own conscience and to others,

for the neglect of those undefined duties, which
though indispensable, and therefore not left to
our choice whether we will practise them or
not, are left to our discretion as to the mode,

and the particular occasions, of practising them;
e.g. “I am not bound to contribute to this
charity in particular; nor to that ; nor to the
other:" the practical conclusion which they
draw, is, that all charity may be dispensed
with.

As men are apt to forget that any two cir
cumstances (not naturally connected) are more
rarely to be met with combined than separate,
though they be not at all incompatible; so also
they are apt to imagine, from finding that they
are rarely combined, that there is an incompa

tibility; e. g. if the chances are ten to one
against a man's possessing strong reasoning
powers, and ten to one against exquisite taste,

the chances against the combination of the
two (supposing them neither connected nor
opposed) will be a hundred to one. Many,

OF FALLACIES.

177

therefore, from finding them so rarely united,
will infer that they are in some measure in
compatible; which Fallacy may easily be ex
posed in the form of Undistributed middle:

“qualities unfriendly to each other are rarely
combined ; excellence in the reasoning powers

and in taste are rarely combined; therefore
they are qualities unfriendly to each other.”
§. 12.
Fallacia ao

The other kind of ambiguity arising from cidentis.
the context, and which is the last case of

Ambiguous middle that we shall notice, is the
“fallacia accidentis,” together with its converse,
“fallacia a dicto secundum quid ad dictum sim
pliciter;” in each of which the middle Term is
used, in one Premiss to signify something con
sidered simply, in itself, and as to its essence;
and in the other Premiss, so as to imply that
its Accidents are taken into account with it: as

in the well-known example, “what is bought
in the market is eaten; raw meat is bought in
the market; therefore raw meat is eaten.”

Here the middle has understood in conjunction
with it, in the major Premiss “as to its sub
stance merely :" in the minor, “as to its condi
tion and circumstances.”

To this head, perhaps, as well as to any, may
be referred the Fallacies which are frequently
founded on the occasional, partial, and tempo
N

178

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

rary variations in the acceptation of some
Term, arising from circumstances of person
time, and place, which will occasion something
to be understood in conjunction with it beyond
its strict literal signification; e.g. the phrase

“Protestant ascendancy,” having become a
kind of watch-word or gathering-cry of a
party, the expression of good wishes for it
would commonly imply an adherence to certain
measures not literally expressed by the words;
to assume therefore that one is unfriendly to

“Protestant ascendancy” in the literal sense,
because he has declared himself unfriendly to

it when implying and connected with such and
such other sentiments, is a gross Fallacy; and
such an one as perhaps the authors of the above
would much object to, if it were assumed of
them that they were adverse to “the cause of
liberty throughout the world,” and to “a fair
representation of the people,” from their ob

jecting to join with the members of a factious
party in the expression of such sentiments.
Such Fallacies may fairly be referred to the
present head.
§. 13. "
Begging the
question.

Of the Non-logical (or material) Fallacies:
and first, of “begging the question;" Petitio
Principii.

The indistinct and unphilosophical account

OF FALLACIES,

179

which has been given by Logical writers of
the Fallacy of “non causa,” and that of “peti

tio principii,” makes it very difficult to ascertain
wherein they conceived them to differ, and
what, according to them, is the nature of each;
without therefore professing to conform ex
actly to their meaning, and with a view to dis
tinctness only, which is the main point, let us
confine the name “petitio principii” to those
cases in which the Premiss either appears ma

nifestly to be the same as the Conclusion, or
is actually proved from the Conclusion, or is
such as would naturally and properly so be
proved; (as if one should attempt to prove the
being of a God from the authority of Holy
writ;) and to the other class be referred all

other cases, in which the Premiss (whether the
expressed or the suppressed one) is either
proved false, or has no sufficient claim to be
received as true.

Let it however be observed,

that in such cases (apparently) as this, we must
not too hastily pronounce the argument falla
cious; for it may be perfectly fair at the com
mencement of an argument to assume a Premiss
that is not more evident than the Conclusion,

or is even ever se paradoxical, provided you
proceed to prove fairly that Premiss: and in
like manner it is both usual and fair to begin
by deducing your Conclusion from a Premiss

exactly equivalent to it; which is merely
N 2

180

throwing the proposition in question into the
form in which it will be most conveniently
proved. Arguing in a Circle, however, must

necessarily be unfair; though it frequently is
practised undesignedly; e. g. some Mechani
cians attempt to prove, (what they ought to

lay down as a probable but doubtful hypothe
sis,) that every particle of matter gravitates

equally; “why 2" because those bodies which
contain more particles ever gravitate more

strongly, i. e. are heavier: “but (it may be
urged) those which are heaviest are not always
more bulky;” “no, but still they contain more

particles, though more closely condensed ;"
“how do you know that " because they are
heavier;” “how does that prove it?” “because
all particles of matter gravitating equally, that
mass which is specifically the heavier must
needs have the more of them in the same

space.”

Obliquity and disguise being of course most
important to the success of the petitio principii
as well as of other Fallacies, the Sophist will in
general either have recourse to the circle, or
else not venture to state distinctly his assump
tion of the point in question, but will rather
assert some other proposition which implies it;
thus keeping out of sight (as a dexterous thief

does stolen goods) the point in question, at the
very moment when he is taking it for granted :

OF FALLACIES.

181

hence the frequent union of this Fallacy with
“ignoratio elemchi.” vide §. 15.The English lan
guage is perhaps the more suitable for the Fal
lacy of petitioprincipii, from its being formed from
two distinct languages, and thus abounding
in synonymous expressions which have no re

semblance in sound, and no connection in ety
mology; so that a Sophist may bring forward a
proposition expressed in words of Saxon ori
gin, and give as a reason for it, the very same

proposition stated in words of Norman origin;
e.g. “to allow every man an unbounded free
dom of speech must always be, on the whole,

advantageous to the State; for it is highly
conducive to the interest of the Community,

that each individual should enjoy a liberty
perfectly unlimited, of expressing his senti
ments.”

§. 14.
Undue as

The next head is, the falsity, or, at least, sumption
undue assumption, of a Premiss, when it is not

equivalent to, or dependent on, the Conclusion;
which, as has been before said, seems to corre

spond nearly with the meaning of Logicians,
when they speak of “non causa pro causa :”
this name indeed would seem to imply a much
narrower class; there being one species of ar
guments which are from cause to effect ; in
which, of course, two things are necessary;

182

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

1st, the sufficiency of the cause, 2nd, its esta
blishment; these are the two Premises; if
therefore the former be unduly assumed, we

are arguing from that which is not a sufficient
cause as if it were so: e.g. as if one should
contend from such a man's having been unjust
or cruel, that he will certainly be visited with
some heavy temporal judgment, and come to
an untimely end. In this instance the Sophist,
from having assumed in the Premiss, the

(granted) existence of a pretended cause, infers
in the conclusion the existence of the pretended
effect, which we have supposed to be the Ques

tion; or vice versa, the pretended effect may be
employed to establish the cause; e.g. inferring
sinfulness from temporal calamity: but when
both the pretended cause and effect are granted,
i. e. granted to exist, then the Sophist will in
fer something from their pretended connection;
i.e. he will assume as a Premiss, that “of these
two admitted facts, the one is the cause of the

other;" as the opponents of the Reformation
assumed that it was the cause of the troubles

which took place at that period, and thence
inferred that it was an evil. In like manner,

nothing is more common than to hear a person
state confidently, as from his own experience,
that such and such a patient was cured by this
or that medicine: whereas all that he abso

lutely knows, is that he took the medicine, and

OF FALLACIES.

IS3

that he recovered. Such an argument as ei
ther of these might strictly be called “non
causa pro causa ;” but it is not probable that

the Logical writers intended any such limita
tion, (which indeed would be wholly unneces
sary and impertinent,) but rather that they
were confounding together cause and reason;
the sequence of Conclusion from Premises being

perpetually mistaken for that of effect from
physical cause.” It may be better, therefore.

to drop the name which tends to perpetuate
this confusion, and simply to state (when such

is the case) that the Premiss is unduly as
sumed; i. e. without being either self-evident,
or satisfactorily proved.

The contrivances by which men may deceive
themselves or others, in assuming Premises
unduly, so that that undue assumption shall not

be perceived, (for it is in this the Fallacy con
sists) are of course infinite. Sometimes (as was
before observed) the doubtful Premiss is sup

pressed, as if it were too evident to need being
proved, or even stated, and as if the whole
question turned on the establishment of the
other Premiss.

Thus H. Tooke proves, by an immense in
duction, that all particles were originally nouns
or verbs; and thence concludes, that in reality
* See Appendix, No. 1, article Reason.

184

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

they are so still, and that the ordinary division
of the parts of speech is absurd; keeping out
of sight, as self-evident, the other Premiss,
which is absolutely false; viz. that the mean

ing and force of a word, now and for ever,
must be that which it, or its root, originally
bore.

Sometimes men are shamed into admitting
an unfounded assertion, by being assured, that
it is so evident, it would argue great weakness
to doubt it. In general, however, the more
skilful Sophist will avoid a direct assertion of

what he means unduly to assume; because that
might direct the reader's attention to the con
sideration of the question whether it be true or
not, since that which is indisputable does not
so often need to be asserted : it succeeds bet

ter, therefore, if you allude to the proposition
as something curious and remarkable; just as

the Royal Society were imposed on by being
asked to account for the fact that a vessel of

water received no addition to its weight by a
live fish put into it; while they were seeking

for the cause, they forgot to ascertain the fact,
and thus admitted without suspicion a mere
fiction. Thus an eminent Scotch writer, in

stead of asserting that “the advocates of Logic
have been worsted and driven from the field

in every controversy,” (an assertion, which if
made, would have been the more readily ascer

1S5

OF FALLACIES.

tained to be perfectly groundless,) merely ob
serves, that “it is a circumstance not a little
remarkable.”

-

One of the many contrivances employed for
this purpose, is what may be called the “Fal
lacy of references ;” which is particularly com
mon in popular theological works. It is of
course a circumstance which adds great weight
to any assertion, that it shall seem to be sup
ported by many passages of Scripture: now
when a writer can find few or none of these, that

distinctly and decidedly favour his opinion, he
may at least find many which may be conceived
capable of being so understood, or which, in
some way or other, remotely relate to the sub

ject; but if these texts were inserted at length,
it would be at once perceived how little they
bear on the question; the usual artifice there
fore is, to give merely references to them ;
trusting that nineteen out of twenty readers
will never take the trouble of turning to the

passages, but, taking for granted that they af
ford, each, some degree of confirmation to what
is maintained, will be overawed by seeing
every assertion supported, as they suppose, by
five or six Scripture-texts.

Frequently the Fallacy of ignoratio elemchi is
called in to the aid of this ; i. e. the Premiss is

assumed on the ground of another proposition,

186

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

somewhat like it, having been proved. Thus, in
arguing by Example, &c. the parallelism of two
cases is often assumed from their being in some

respects alike, though perhaps they differ in the
very point which is essential to the argument ;
e.g. from the circumstance that some men of
humble station, who have been well educated,

are apt to think themselves above low drudgery,

it is argued, that universal education of the
lower orders would beget general idleness:

this argument rests, of course, on the assump
tion of parallelism in the two cases, viz. the
past, and the future; whereas there is a cir
cumstance that is absolutely essential, in which
they differ; for when education is universal it

must cease to be a distinction ; which is pro
bably the very circumstance that renders men
too proud for their work.
This very same Fallacy is often resorted to on
the opposite side: an attempt is made to inva
lidate some argument from Example, by point
ing out a difference between the two cases,

though they agree in everything that is essen
tial to the question.

Lastly, it may be here remarked, conform
ably with what has been formerly said, that it
will often be left to your choice whether to re
fer this or that fallacious argument to the
present head, or that of Ambiguous middle;

OF FALLACIES.

“if the middle term is here used in this sense,
there is an ambiguity; if in that sense, the pro
position is false.”
§. 15.
Irrelevant
The last kind of Fallacy to be discussed is Conclusion.

that of Irrelevant Conclusion, commonly
called ignoratio elemchi. Various kinds of pro
positions are, according to the occasion, sub
stituted for the one of which proof is required.
Sometimes the particular for the universal;
sometimes a proposition with different Terms:
and various are the contrivances employed to
effect and to conceal this substitution, and to

make the Conclusion which the Sophist has
drawn, answer, practically, the same purpose
as the one he ought to have established. We
say, “practically the same purpose,” because
it will very often happen that some emotion will
be excited—some sentiment impressed on the
mind—(by a dexterous employment of this
Fallacy) such as shall bring men into the dis

position requisite for your purpose, though
they may not have assented to, or even stated
distinctly in their own minds, the proposition
which it was your business to establish. Thus
if a Sophist has to defend one who has been
guilty of some serious offence, which he wishes

to extenuate, though he is unable distinctly to
prove that it is not such, yet if he can succeed

18S

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

in making the audience laugh at some casual
matter, he has gained practically the same
point. So also if any one has pointed out the
extenuating circumstances in some particular
case of offence, so as to show that it differs

widely from the generality of the same class,
the Sophist, if he find himself unable to dis
prove these circumstances, may do away the

force of them, by simply referring the action to
that very class, which no one can deny that it

belongs to, and the very name of which will
excite a feeling of disgust sufficient to counter

act the extenuation; e.g. let it be a case of
peculation, and that many mitigating circum
stances have been brought forward which can
not be denied ; the sophistical opponent will
reply, “well, but after all, the man is a rogue,
and there is an end of it;" now in reality this
was (by hypothesis) never the question; and
the mere assertion of what was never denied,
ought not, in fairness, to be regarded as deci

sive; but, practically, the odiousness of the
word, arising in great measure from the asso

ciation of those very circumstances which belong
to most of the class, but which we have sup
posed to be absent in this particular instance,
excites precisely that feeling of disgust, which
in effect destroys the force of the defence. In
like manner we may refer to this head all cases
of improper appeals to the passions, and every

OF FALLACIES.

189

thing else which is mentioned by Aristotle as
extraneous to the matter in hand, (#2, r3
*payaaros.)
In all these cases, as has been before ob

served, if the Fallacy we are now treating of

be employed for the apparent establishment,
not of the ultimate Conclusion, but (as it very
commonly happens) of a Premiss, (i. e. if the
Premiss required be assumed on the ground

that some proposition resembling it has been
proved) then there will be a combination of
this Fallacy with the last mentioned.

A good instance of the employment and expo
sure of this Fallacy occurs in Thucydides, in the

speeches of Cleon and Diodotus concerning the
Mitylenaeans: the former (over and above his
appeal to the angry passions of his audience)

urges the justice of putting the revolters to
death; which, as the latter remarked, was no

thing to the purpose, since the Athenians were
not sitting in judgment, but in deliberation, of
which the proper end is expediency.
It is evident, that ignoratio elemchi may be
employed as well for the apparent refutation of
your opponent's proposition, as for the appa
rent establishment of your own ; for it is sub
stantially the same thing, to prove what was not
denied, or to disprove what was not asserted:
the latter practice is not less common, and it is

more offensive, because it frequently amounts

190

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC,

,

to a personal affront, in attributing to a person

opinions, &c. which he perhaps holds in ab
horrence.

Thus, when in a discussion one

party vindicates, on the ground of general ex
pediency, a particular instance of resistance to
Government in a case of intolerable oppression,

the opponent may gravely maintain, that “we
ought not to do evil that good may come:"
a proposition which of course had hever been
denied, the point in dispute being, “whether
resistance in this particular case were doing
evil or not." In this example it is to be re
marked (and the remark will apply very gene

rally) that the Fallacy of petitio principii is
combined with that of ignoratio elemchi, which
is a very common and successful practice; viz.
the Sophist proves, or disproves, not the pro
position which is really in question, but one
which so implies it as to proceed on the suppo
sition that it is already decided, and can admit
of no doubt; by this means his “assumption

of the point in question” is so indirect and ob
lique, that it may easily escape notice; and he
thus establishes, practically, his Conclusion,
at the very moment when he is withdrawing
your attention from it to another question.
There are certain kinds of argument re

counted and named by Logical writers, which
we should by no means universally call Fal
lacies; but which, when unfairly used, and so

far as they are fallacious, may very well be re-ºº:
ferred to the present head; such as the “ ar- “
gumentum ad hominem,” or personal argument,
“argumentum ad verecundiam,” “argumentum

ad populum,” &c. all of them regarded as con
tradistinguished from “argumentum ad rem,”
or according to others (meaning probably the
very same thing) “adjudicium.” These have
all been described in the lax and popular lan
guage before alluded to, but not scientifically:
the “ argumentum ad hominem” they say, “is
addressed to the peculiar circumstances, cha

racter, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the
individual, and therefore has a reference to

him only, and does not bear directly and abso
lutely on the real question, as the “argumentum
ad rem' does :” in like manner, the “argumen
tum ad cerecundiam” is described as an appeal
to our reverence for some respected authority,
some venerable institution, &c. and the “argu

mentum ad populum,” as an appeal to the preju
dices, passions, &c. of the multitude; and so of
the rest. Along with these is usually enume
rated “argumentum ad ignorantiam,” which is
here omitted, as being evidently nothing more
than the employment of some kind of Fallacy,
in the widest sense of that word, towards such

as are likely to be deceived by it. It appears
then (to speak rather more technically) that

in the “argumentum ad hominem” the conclu

192

ELEMENTS OF LOGIC.

sion which actually is established, is not the
absolute and general one in question, but rela
tive and particular; viz. not that “such and
such is the fact,” but that “this man is bound

to admit it, in conformity to his principles of
Reasoning, or in consistency with his own con
duct, situation,” &c.”

Such a Conclusion it is

often both allowable and necessary to establish,
in order to silence those who will not yield to fair
general argument; or to convince those whose
weakness and prejudices would not allow them
* The “argumentum ad hominem” will often have the
effect of shifting the burden of proof, not unjustly, to the
adversary. A common instance is the defence, certainly
the readiest and most concise, frequently urged by the
Sportsman, when accused of barbarity in sacrificing unof
fending hares or trout to his amusement: he replies, as he
may safely do, to most of his assailants, “why do you feed
on the flesh of animals?” and that this answer presses

hard, is manifested by its being usually opposed by a pal
pable falsehood; viz. that the animals which are killed for
food are sacrificed to our necessities; though not only men
cam, but a large proportion (probably a great majority) of
the human race actually do, subsist in health and vigour
without flesh diet; and the earth would support a much
greater human population were such a practice universal.
When shamed out of this argument they sometimes urge
that the brute creation would overrun the earth, if we did

not kill them for food; an argument, which, if it were valid
at all, would not justify their feeding on fish; though, if
fairly followed up, it would justify Swift's proposal for

keeping down the excessive population of Ireland. The
true reason, viz. that they eat flesh for the gratification of

the palate, and have a taste for the pleasures of the table,
though not for the sports of the field, is one which they do
not like to assign.

OF FALLACIES.

193

to assign to it its due weight: it is thus that
our Lord on many occasions silences the cavils

of the Jews; as in the vindication of healing
on the Sabbath, which is paralleled by the au
thorized practice of drawing out a beast that
has fallen into a pit. All this, as we have said,

is perfectly fair, provided it be done plainly,
and avowedly; but if you attempt to sub
stitute this partial and relative Conclusion
for a more general one—if you triumph as

having established your proposition absolutely
and universally, from having established it, in

reality, only as far as it relates to your oppo
nent, then you are guilty of a Fallacy of the
kind which we are now treating of: your Con
clusion is not in reality that which was, by

your own account, proposed to be proved: the
fallaciousness depends upon the deceit or at
tempt to deceive. The same observations will

apply to “argumentum ad verecundiam," and
the rest.

It is very common to employ an ambiguous
Term for the purpose of introducing the Fal

lacy of irrelevant Conclusion: i. e. when you
cannot prove your proposition in the sense in
which it was maintained, to prove it in some

other sense; e. g. those who contend against
the efficacy of faith, usually employ that word
in their arguments in the sense of mere belief,

Conclusion, they oppose it to one in which the

be difficult to turn their Passions, once roused, in the direc

tion required, and to make them view the case before them
in a very different light. When the metal is heated, it
may easily be moulded into the desired form. Thus vehe
ment indignation against some crime, may be directed
against a person who has not been proved guilty of it;
and vague declamations against corruption, oppression, &c.
or against the mischiefs of anarchy; with high-flown pa
negyrics on liberty, rights of man, &c. or on social order,
justice, the constitution, law, religion, &c. will gradually
lead the hearers to take for granted, without proof, that
the measure proposed will lead to these evils or these ad
vantages; and it will in consequence become the object of
groundless abhorrence or admiration. For the very utter
ance of such words as have a multitude of what may be
called stimulating ideas associated with them, will operate

like a charm on the minds, especially of the ignorant and
unthinking, and raise such a tumult of feeling, as will ef
fectually blind their judgment; so that a string of vague
abuse or panegyric, will often have the effect of a train of
sound Argument. This artifice falls under the head of
‘Irrelevant Conclusion,’ or ignoratio elemchi, mentioned
in the Treatise on Fallacies.

Mr. Bentham has treated of

the employment of these ‘passion-kindling appellatives,'
as he calls them, under the head of ‘Fallacies of Confu

sion,’ in his work entitled the Book of Fallacies. Many
other observations, also occurring in that Treatise, will be

found very nearly to coincide with that which has been

OF FALLACIES.

§. 16.

The Fallacy of ignoratio elemchi is nowhere
more common than in protracted controversy,

when one of the parties, after having attempted
in vainto maintain his position, shifts his ground
as covertly as possible to another, instead of
honestly giving up the point. An instance oc
curs in an attack made on the system pursued

at one of our Universities. The objectors
finding themselves unable to maintain their
said in the third chapter of the Article on Logic just re
ferred to ; though not so strictly tried by Logical rules.
Of many popular Sophisms he has given (though in
a singular manner) an able exposure; and of many
others, unfortunately, the most striking exemplifications

may be found in his own reasonings; in which petitio
principii in particular, occurs perpetually; as well as the
one now before us,

the employment of vituperative, or as

he calls it ‘Dyslogistic’ language: that also which we
there described as the “Fallacy of Objections,” (which
might be called by a lover of new-coined epithets, in lan
guage similar to that often employed by Mr. Bentham, a
reverse-of-wrong-for-right-mistaking Fallacy) is skilfully
described, and but too often employed; as if, because

existing abuses are maintained by those who have an in
terest in keeping what they have, no apprehension were to
be entertained of new evils being introduced through the

interested conduct of those who wish to acquire what they
have not; and as if, because many are misled by a blind
veneration for ‘Authority’ and the “Wisdom of our An
cestors,” there did not exist also, as antagonist muscles, as

it were, to these, an equally blind craving after novelty
for its own sake, and a veneration for the ingenuity of one's

own inventions.”—Ency. Met, vol. i. p. 265, art. Rhe.

It has been remarked above, that one class
of the propositions that may be, in this Falla

cy, substituted for the one required, is the par

ticular for the universal: nearly akin to this is
the very common case of proving something
to be possible when it ought to have been
proved highly probable ; or probable, when it
ought to have been proved necessary; or,

which comes to the very same, proving it to be
not necessary, when it should have been proved

not probable; or improbable, when it should
have been proved impossible. Aristotle (in

the Fallacy, as giving an undue advantage to

acquittal to this; the jury considering that the
evidence brought does not demonstrate the ab

absolute impossibility of his being innocent,
though perhaps the chances are innumerable
against it.

§. 17.
of
Similar to this case is that which may be Fallacy
§.:
called the Fallacy of objections: i.e. showing

that there are objections against some plan,

theory, or system, and thence inferring that it
should be rejected; when that which ought to
have been proved, is, that there are more, or
stronger objections, against the receiving than
the rejecting of it. This is the main, and al
most universal Fallacy of infidels, and is that
of which men should be first and principally
warned. This is also the strong hold of
bigoted anti-innovators, who oppose all re
forms and alterations indiscriminately; for

there never was, nor will be, any plan executed
or proposed, against which strong and even

unanswerable objections may not be urged; so
that unless the opposite objections be set in
the balance on the other side, we can never

advance a step. “There are objections,” said
Dr. Johnson, “against a plenum, and objec

tions against a racuum; but one of them must
be true.”*

The very same Fallacy indeed is employed
on the other side, by those who are for over
throwing whatever is established as soon as
they can prove an objection against it, without
considering whether more and weightier ob
* This is, as has been said, the principal engine employed
by the adversaries of our Faith: they find numerous “ob
jections” against variousparts of Scripture; to some of which
no satisfactory answer can be given; and the incautious
hearer is apt, while his attention is fixed on these, to for
get that there are infinitely more, and stronger objections
against the supposition that the Christian Religion is of
human origin; and that where we cannot answer all objec
tions, we are bound in reason and in candour to adopt the
hypothesis which labours under the least. That the case
is as I have stated, I am authorized to assume, from this cir

cumstance; that no complete and consistent account has
ever been given of the manner in which the Christian Reli
gion, supposing it a human contrivance, could have arisen
and prevailed as it did. And yet this may obviously be
demanded with the utmost fairness, of those who deny its
divine origin. The Religion exists: that is the phenome
mon: those who will not allow it to have come from God, are

bound to solve the phenomenon on some other hypothesis

less open to objections: they are not indeed called on to prove
that it actually did arise in this or that way; but to sug
gest (consistently with acknowledged facts) some probable
way in which it may have arisen, reconcileable with all the
eircumstances of the case.

That infidels have never done

this, though they have had near 2,000 years to try,
amounts to a confession that mo such hypothesis can be
devised, which will not be open to greater objections than
he against Christianity.

jections may not lie against their own schemes:
but their opponents have this decided advan
tage over them, that they can urge with great

plausibility, “we do not call upon you to re
ject at once whatever is objected to, but merely
to suspend your judgment and not come to a
decision as long as there are reasons on both
sides:" now since there always will be reasons
on both sides, this non-decision is practically
the very same thing as a decision in favour of

the eristing state of things; the delay of trial
becomes equivalent to an acquittal.”

contend that some of those books are elemen

tion, viz. whether they are all so. This is the

the main positions in any work to be irrefra

them, or some subordinate part in short, will
not admit of a plausible objection; the oppo

questions, and comes forward with “a Reply.”
to such and such a work.

Hence the danger of ever advancing more
than can be well maintained; since the refu

tation of that will often quash the whole: a

guilty person may often escape by having too
much laid to his charge ; so he may also by
having too much evidence against him, i. e.
some that is not in itself satisfactory: thus, a
prisoner may sometimes obtain acquittal by
showing that one of the witnesses against him

is an infamous informer and spy; though per
haps if that part of the evidence had been
omitted, the rest would have been sufficient for
conviction.

Cases of this nature might very well be re
ferred also to the Fallacy formerly mentioned,
of inferring the Falsity of the Conclusion from

the Falsity of a Premiss; which indeed is very

OF FALLACIES.

201

closely allied to the present Fallacy: the real

question is “whether or not this Conclusion
ought to be admitted;" the Sophist confines
himself to the question, “whether or not it is
established by this particular argument;" leaving
it to be inferred by the audience, if he has car
ried his point as to the latter question, that
the former is thereby decided.

It will readily be perceived that nothing is Conclusion.

less conducive to the success of the Fallacy in
question than to state clearly, in the outset,
either the proposition you are about to prove,
or that which you ought to prove ; it answers
best to begin with the Premises, and to introduce
a pretty long chain of argument before you
arrive at the Conclusion.

Thé careless hearer

takes for granted, at the beginning, that this
chain will lead to the Conclusion required; and
by the time you are come to the end, he is
ready to take for granted that the Conclusion
which you draw is the one required; his idea
of the question having gradually become indis

tinct.

This Fallacy is greatly aided by the

common practice of suppressing the Conclu
sion and leaving it to be supplied by the hearer,
who is of course less likely to perceive whether

it be really that “which was to be proved,”
than if it were distinctly stated. The practice

therefore is at best suspicious; and it is better
in general to avoid it, and to give and require
a distinct statement of the Conclusion in
tended.

Jests.

§. 20.
Before we dismiss the subject of Fallacies,
it may not be improper to mention the just and

ingenious remark, that Jests are Fallacies;*
i. e. Fallacies so palpable as not to be likely to

deceive any one, but yet bearing just that re
semblance of argument which is calculated to
amuse by the contrast; in the same manner
that a parody does, by the contrast of its levity
with the serious production which it imitates.
There is indeed something laughable even in
Fallacies which are intended for serious con

viction, when they are thoroughly exposed.
There are several different kinds of joke and
raillery, which will be found to correspond
with the different kinds of Fallacy: the pun
(to take the simplest and most obvious case) is
evidently, in most instances, a mock argument
founded on a palpable equivocation of the mid
dle Term: and the rest in like manner will be

found to correspond to the respective Falla
cies, and to be imitations of serious argument.
It is probable indeed that all jests, sports, or

found, on examination, to be imitative of serious
transactions; as of war, or commerce.* But

to enter fully into this subject would be unsuit
able to the present occasion.
I shall subjoin some general remarks on the

legitimate province of Reasoning, and on its
connection with Inductive philosophy, and with
Rhetoric : on which points much misappre
hension has prevailed, tending to throw obscu
rity over the design and use of the Science
under consideration.
* See some excellent remarks on “Imitation,” in Dr.

A. Smith's posthumous essays.

DISSERTATION
on the

PROVINCE OF REASONING.

Logic being concerned with the theory of
Reasoning, it is evidently necessary, in order
to take a correct view of this Science, that all

misapprehensions should be removed, relative
to the occasions on which the Reasoning-pro
cess is employed,—the purposes it has in view,
—and the limits within which it is confined.

Simple and obvious as such questions may
appear to those who have not thought much on
the subject, they will appear on further consi
deration to be involved in much perplexity and
obscurity, from the vague and inaccurate lan
guage of many popular writers. To the con
fused and incorrect notions that prevail respect

ing the Reasoning-process may be traced most
of the common mistakes respecting the Science
of Logic, and much of the unsound and un
philosophical argumentation which is so often
to be met with in the works of ingenious
writers.

206

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

These errors have been incidentally ad

verted to in the foregoing part of this work;
but it may be desirable, before we dismiss the
subject, to offer on these points some further
remarks, which could not have been there in

troduced without too great an interruption to
the developement of the system. Little or no

thing indeed remains to be said that is not
implied in the principles which have been al
ready laid down; but the results and applica
tions of those principles are liable in many
instances to be overlooked, if not distinctly

pointed out. These supplementary observa
tions will neither require, nor admit of, so sys
tematic an arrangement as has hitherto been

aimed at ; since they will be such as are sug
gested principally by the objections and mis
takes of those who have misunderstood, or

partially, entirely, the nature of the Logical
system.

CHAPTER I.

OF INDUCTION.

§. 1.
MUCH has been said by some writers of the Mistake of
opposing

superiority of the Inductive to the Syllogistic jº."
method of seeking truth, as if the two stood
opposed to each other; and of the advantage
of substituting the Organon of Bacon for that
of Aristotle, &c. &c. which indicates a total
misconception of the nature of both. There
is, however, the more excuse for the confusion

of thought which prevails on this subject, be
cause eminent Logical writers have treated, or
at least have appeared to treat, of Induction as
a distinctkind of argument from the Syllogism;
which if it were, it certainly might be con

trasted with the Syllogism: or rather the whole
Syllogistic theory would fall to the ground,
since one of the very first principles it esta
blishes, is that all Reasoning, on whatever sub
ject, is one and the same process, which may
be clearly exhibited in the form of Syllogisms.
It is hardly to be supposed, therefore, that this
was the deliberate meaning of those writers;

though it must be admitted that they have

208

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

countenanced the error in question, by their
inaccurate expressions. This inaccuracy seems
chiefly to have arisen from a vagueness in the
use of the word Induction, which is sometimes

employed to designate the process of investiga
tion and of collecting facts; sometimes, the

deducing of an inference from those facts.
The former of these processes (i. e. that of ob
servation and experiment) is undoubtedly dis
tinct from that which takes place in the Syllo
gism; but then it is not a process of argument;

the latter again is an argumentative process;
but then it is, like all other arguments, capable
of being Syllogistically expressed. And hence
Induction has come to be regarded as a distinct

kind of argument from the Syllogism. This
Fallacy cannot be more concisely or clearly
stated, than in the technical form with which

we may now presume our readers to be fami
liar.

“Induction is distinct from Syllogism:
Induction is a process of Reasoning;” therefore

“There is a process of Reasoning distinct from Syl
logism.”

Here, “Induction,” which is the middle
Term, is used in different senses in the two
Premises.

Induction.

In the process of Reasoning by which we
deduce, from our observation of certain known

209

cases, an inference with respect to unknown
ones, we are employing a Syllogism in Barbara
with the majorº Premiss suppressed; that

being always substantially the same, as it as
serts, that “what belongs to the individual or
individuals we have examined, belongs to the
whole class under which they come :” e. g.
from an examination of the history of several
tyrannies, and finding that each of them was of
short duration, we conclude, that “the same is

likely to be the case with all tyrannies;" the
suppressed major Premiss being easily sup
plied by the hearer; viz. “ that what belongs
to the tyrannies in question is likely to belong
to all.”

Induction, therefore, so far forth as it is an º:

argument, may, of course, be stated Syllogisti-"
cally; but so far forth as it is a process of in
quiry with a view to obtain the Premises of
that argument, it is, of course, out of the pro
vince of Logic. Whether the Induction (in

this last sense) has been sufficiently ample, i.e.
takes

in a sufficient

number of individual

cases, whether the character of those cases

he gives will sufficiently prove this: “This and that, and
the other magnet attract iron; therefore so do all.” If
this were, as he asserts, an Enthymeme whose minor is
suppressed, the only Premiss which we could supply, to fill
it up, would be, “All magnets are this, that, and the other;”
which is manifestly false.

has been correctly ascertained—and how far
the individuals we have examined are likely to
resemble, in this or that circumstance, the rest
of the class, &c. &c., are points that require
indeed great judgment and caution; but this
judgment and caution are not to be aided by

Logic, because they are, in reality, employed
in deciding whether or not it is fair and allow
able to lay down your Premises ; i. e. whether
you are authorized or not, to assert, that
“what is true of the individuals you have exa
mined, is true of the whole class:” and that
this or that is true of those individuals. Now,

the rules of Logic have nothing to do with the
truth or falsity of the Premises, but merely
teach us to decide (not whether the Premises

are fairly laid down, but whether the Conclu
sion follows fairly from the Premises or not.
§. 2.

*...

Whether the Premiss may fairly be assumed,

*** or not, is a point which cannot be decided with
out a competent knowledge of the nature of the
subject: e. g. in Natural Philosophy, in which
the circumstances which in any case affect the

result, are usually far more clearly ascertained,

an individual magnet will attract iron, we are
authorized to conclude that this property is

211

universal: in the affairs of human life, on the

other hand, a much fuller Induction is required,
as in the former example. In short, the de

gree of evidence for any proposition we origi
nally assume as a Premiss (whether the ex

pressed or the suppressed one) is not to be
learned from Logic, nor indeed from any one
distinct Science; but is the province of what
ever Science furnishes the subject-matter of
your argument. None but a Politician can

judge rightly of the degree of evidence of a
proposition in Politics; a Naturalist, in Natu

ral History, &c. &c.; e.g. from examination of .”
many horned animals, as sheep, cows, &c. a
Naturalist finds that they have cloven feet;
now his skill as a Naturalist is to be shewn in

judging whether these animals are likely to
resemble in the form of their feet all other

horned animals; and it is the exercise of this

judgment, together with the examination of in
dividuals, that constitutes what is usually

meant by the Inductive process ; which is that
by which we gain, properly, new truths, and
which is not connected with Logic; being not

what is strictly called Reasoning, but Investiga
tion. But when this major Premiss is granted
him, and is combined with the minor, viz. that
the animals he has examined have cloven feet,

then he draws the Conclusion Logically: viz.
P 2

212

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

that “the feet of all horned animals are cloven.”*

Again, if from several times meeting with ill
luck on a Friday, any one concluded that Fri
day, universally, is an unlucky day, one would
object to his Induction ; and yet it would not
be, as an argument, illogical; since the Conclu

sion follows fairly, if you grant his implied Pre
miss, that the events which happened on those
particular Fridays are such as must happen on
all Fridays; but we should object to his laying
down this Premiss ; and therefore should justly
say that his Induction was faulty, though his
argument were correct.

to be fairly regarded as a sample of the whole

easily understood, as being, mutatis mutandis,
the same in every Induction.
What has been said of Induction will equally
apply to Example; which differs from it only
in having a singular instead of a general Com
clusion; e. g. in the instance above, if the
Conclusion had been drawn, not respecting
tyrannies in general, but respecting this or that

tyranny, that it was not likely to be lasting,
each of the cases adduced to prove this, would
have been called an Example.

214

CHAPTER II.
ON THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

*

§. 1.

WHETHER it is by a process of Reasoning
that New Truths are brought to light, is a

question which seems to be decided in the ne
gative by what has been already said; though
many eminent writers seem to have taken for

granted the affirmative. It is, perhaps, in a
great measure, a dispute concerning the use of
words; but it is not, for that reason, either un

interesting or unimportant, since an inaccurate
use of language may often, in matters of Sci
ence, lead to confusion of thought, and to er
roneous conclusions. And, in the present
instance, much of the undeserved contempt
which has been bestowed on the Logical sys
tem may be traced to this source; for when any
one has laid down, that “Reasoning is import

ant in the discovery of Truth,” and that “Logic
is of no service in the discovery of Truth,” (each
of which propositions is true in a certain sense
of the terms employed, but not in the same sense)
he is naturally led to conclude, that there are

processes of Reasoning to which the Syllogistic
theory does not apply, and, of course, to mis
conceive altogether the nature of the Science.

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

215

In maintaining the negative side of the
above question, three things are to be premised:
first, that it is not contended that Discoveries

of any kind of Truth can be made (or at least
are usually made) without Reasoning; only,

that Reasoning is not the whole of the process,
nor the whole of that which is important
therein: secondly, that Reasoning shall be
taken in the sense, not of every exercise of the
Reason, but of Argumentation, in which we
have all along used it, and in which it has been
defined by all the Logical writers, viz. “from
certain granted propositions to infer another

proposition as the consequence of them :”
thirdly, that by a “New Truth,” be understood
something neither expressly nor virtually as
serted before, not implied and involved in
anything already known.
To prove then this point demonstratively
becomes in this manner perfectly easy; for
since all Reasoning (in the sense above defined)

may be resolved into Syllogisms; and since
even the objectors to Logic make it a subject
of complaint, that in a Syllogism the Premises
do virtually assert the Conclusion, it follows
at once that no New Truth (as above defined)

can be elicited by any process of Reasoning.
It is on this ground, indeed, that the justly
celebrated author of the Philosophy of Rhetoric
objects to the Syllogism altogether, as neces

216

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

sarily involving a petitio principii; an objection
which, of course, he would not have been dis

posed to bring forward, had he perceived that,
whether well or ill-founded, it lies against all
arguments whatever.
• Had he been aware that a Syllogism is no

distinct kind of argument otherwise than in
form, but is, in fact, any argument whatever,

stated regularly and at full length, he would
have obtained a more correct view of the ob

ject of all Reasoning; which is, merely to ex
pand and unfold the assertions wrapt up, as it
were, and implied in those with which we set

out, and to bring a person to perceive and ac
knowledge the full force of that which he has
admitted,—to contemplate it in various points
of view, to admit in one shape what he has
already admitted in another, and to give up
and disallow whatever is inconsistent with it.

Nor is it always a very easy task even to
bring before the mind the several bearings,
the various applications,—of any one proposi
tion. A common Term comprehends several,
often, numberless individuals; and these, often,

in some respects, widely differing from each

other ; and no one can be, on each occasion of
his employing such a Term, attending to and
fixing his mind on each of the individuals, or

even of the species so comprehended.

It is to

be remembered, too, that both Division and

217

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

Generalization are in a great degree arbitrary;
i. e. that we may both divide the same genus
on several different principles, and may refer
the same species to several different classes,
according to the nature of the discourse and
drift of the argument; each of which classes
will furnish a distinct middle Term for an ar

gument, according to the question. e. g. If we
wished to prove that “a horse feels,” (to adopt
an ill-chosen example from the above writer,)
we might refer it to the genus “animal;" to
prove that “it has only a single stomach,” to
the genus of “non-ruminants;” to prove that

it is “likely to degenerate in a very cold cli
mate,” we should class it with “original pro
ductions of a hot climate,” &c. &c. Now each
of these, and numberless others to which the

same thing might be referred, are implied by
the very term “horse;” yet it cannot be ex
pected that they can all be at once present to
the mind whenever that term

is

uttered.

Much less, when, instead of such a Term as

that, we are employing Terms of a very abstract
and, perhaps, complex signification,” as “go
vernment, justice,” &c.

The ten Categoriest or Predicaments, which categories.
* On this point there are some valuable remarks in the
Philosophy of Rhetoric itself, book iv. ch. vii.

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

Aristotle and other Logical writers have treat

ed of, being certain general heads or summa
genera, to one or more of which every Term
may be

referred, serve the purpose of marking

out certain tracks, as it were, which are to be

pursued in searching for middle Terms, in each
argument respectively; it being essential that
we should generalize on a right principle, with
a view to the question before us; or, in other
words, that we should abstract that portion of

any object presented to the mind, which is
important to the argument in hand. There
are expressions in common use which have a
reference to this caution ; such as, “this is a

question, not as to the nature of the object, but
the magnitude of it:” “this is a question of
time, or of place,” &c. i. e. “the subject must
be referred to this or to that Category.”
With respect to the meaning of the Terms
in question, “Discovery,” and “New Truth;”
it matters not whether we confine ourselves to

the narrowest sense, or admit the widest, pro

vided we do but distinguish : there certainly

are two kinds of “New Truth" and of “Dis-ºn,"
covery,” if we take those words in the widest
sense in which they are ever used. First,
such Truths as were, before they were disco
vered, absolutely unknown, being not implied
by anything we previously knew, though we
might perhaps suspect them as probable; such
are all matters of fact strictly so called, when
first made known to one who had not any such
previous knowledge, as would enable him to
ascertain them à priori; i.e. by Reasoning ;
as, if we inform a man that we have a colony
at Botany Bay; or that the earth is at such a
distance from the sun; or that platina is hea
vier than gold. The communication of this
kind of knowledge is most usually, and most

strictly, called information; we gain it from ob-Information.
servation, and from testimony; no mere internal
workings of our own minds (except when the
mind itself is the very object to be observed)
or mere discussions in words, will make these

known to us; though there is great room for

sagacity in judging what testimony to admit, and
forming conjectures that may lead to profitable
observation, and to experiments with a view to
it.

ferent nature. That which may be elicited by

which we already know, we assent to on that
ground, and not from observation or testimony:
to take a Geometrical truth upon trust, or to
attempt to ascertain it by observation, would
betray a total ignorance of the nature of the
Science. In the longest demonstration, the
Mathematical teacher seems only to lead us to
make use of our own stores, and point out to
us how much we had already admitted; and,
in the case of many Ethical propositions, we
assent at first hearing, though perhaps we had
never heard or thought of the proposition be
fore; so also do we readily assent to the testi

mony of a respectable man, who tells us that
our troops have gained a victory; but how dif
ferent is the nature of the assentin the two cases.

In the latter we are ready to thank the man for
his information, as being such as no wisdom
or learning would have enabled us to ascertain;
in the former, we usually exclaim “very true?”
“that is a valuable and just remark; that ne
ver struck me before " implying at once our
practical ignorance of it, and also our con
sciousness that we possess, in what we already
know, the means to ascertain the truth of it;

that we have a right, in short, to bear our tes
timony to its truth.
To all practical purposes, indeed, a Truth of

this description may be as completely un
known to a man as the other; but as soon as

221

it is set before him, and the argument by
which it is connected with his previous motions
is made clear to him, he recognises it as some

thing conformable to, and contained in, his
former belief.

It is not improbable that Plato's doctrine of
Reminiscence arose from a hasty extension of
what he had observed in this class, to all ac

quisition of knowledge whatever. His Theory
of ideas served to confound together matters of
fact respecting the nature of things, (which may
be perfectly new to us) with propositions rela
ting to our own motions, and modes of thought;
(or to speak, perhaps, more correctly, our own
arbitrary signs) which propositions must be
contained and implied in those very complex
notions themselves; and whose truth is a con

formity, not to the nature of things, but to our
own hypothesis. Such are all propositions in

pure Mathematics, and many in Ethics, viz.
those which involve no assertion as to real

matters of fact. It has been rightly remarked,”
that Mathematical propositions are not pro
perly true or false in the same sense as any

proposition respecting real fact is so called;
and hence the truth (such as it is) of such pro
positions is necessary and eternal; since it
amounts only to this, that any complex notion

which you have arbitrarily framed, must be
exactly conformable to itself. The proposition,
that “the belief in a future state, combined

with a complete devotion to the present life, is
not consistent with the character of prudence,"
would be mot at all the less true if a future

state were a chimera, and prudence a quality
which was no-where met with ; nor would the

truth of the Mathematician's conclusion be
shaken, that “circles are to each other as the
squares of their diameters,” should it be found
that there never had been a circle or a square,
conformable to the definition, in rerum na
turá.*

The Ethical proposition, just instanced, is
one of those which Locke calls “trifling,” be

* Hence the futility of the attempt of Clarke, and others,
to demonstrate (in the mathematical sense) the existence of

a Deity. This can only be done by covertly assuming in
the Premises the very point to be proved. No matter of
fact can be mathematically demonstrated ; though it may
be proved in such a manner as to leave no doubt on the
mind. e. g. I have no more doubt that I met such and
such a man, in this or that place, yesterday, than that the
angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles: but the
kind of certainty I have of these two truths is widely dif
ferent; to say, that I did not meet the man, would be false

indeed, but it would not be anything inconceivable, self
contradictory, and absurd ; but it would be so, to deny the
equality of the angles of a triangle to two right angles.

not, strictly speaking, any information: but he
should consider, that to remind a man of what
he had not, and what he would not have

thought of, may be, practically, as valuable as
giving him information; and that most propo
sitions in the best sermons, and all, in pure
Mathematics, are of the description which he
CenSUlreS.

It is, indeed, rather remarkable that he should
speak so often of building Morals into a de
monstrative Science, and yet speak so slight
ingly of those very propositions to which we
must absolutely confine ourselves, in order to
give to Ethics even the appearance of such a
Science; for the instant you come to an asser
tion respecting a matter of fact, as that “men

(i. e. actually existing men) are bound to prac
tise virtue,” or “are liable to many temptations,”
you have stepped off the ground of strict de
monstration, just as when you proceed to
practical Geometry.

But to return: it is of the utmost import-lºº
ance to distinguish these two kinds of Disco-"
very of Truth. To the former, as I have
said, the word “information” is most strictly
applied; the communication of the latter is

more properly called “instruction.” I speak of
the usual practice; for it would be going too
far to pretend that writers are uniform and

224

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

consistent in the use of these, or of any other

term. We say that the Historian gives us in
formation respecting past times; the Traveller,

respecting foreign countries: on the other
hand, the Mathematician gives instruction in
the principles of his Science; the Moralist in
structs us in our duties; and we generally use
the expressions “a well-informed man,” and
“a well-instructed man,” in a sense conforma
ble to that which has been here laid down.

However, let the words be used as they may,
the things are evidently different, and ought to
be distinguished. It is a question compara
tively unimportant, whether the term “Disco
very” shall or shall not be extended to the

eliciting of those Truths, which, being implied
in our previous knowledge, may be established
by mere strict Reasoning. Similar verbal
questions, indeed, might be raised respecting
many other cases: e.g. one has forgotten (i. e.
cannot recollect) the name of some person or
place; perhaps we even try to think of it, but
in vain; at last some one reminds us, and we

instantly recognise it as the one we wanted to
recollect; it may be asked, was this in our
mind or not? The answer is, that in one
sense it was, and in another sense, it was not.

Or, again, suppose there is a vein of metal on
a man's estate, which he does not know of ;

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH,

225

is it part of his possessions or not? and when
he finds it out and works it, does he then ac

quire a new possession or not? Certainly not,
in the same sense as if he has a fresh estate

bequeathed to him, which he had formerly no
right to; but to all practical purposes, it is a
new possession. This case, indeed, may serve
as an illustration of the one we have been con

sidering ; and in all these cases, if the real

distinction be understood, the verbal question
will not be of much consequence. To use one
more illustration. Reasoning has been aptly
compared to the piling together blocks of
stone; on each of which, as on a pedestal, a
man can raise himself a small, and but a small,

height above the plain; but which, when skil
fully built up, will form a flight of steps, which
will raise him to a great elevation. Now (to
pursue this analogy) when the materials are
all ready to the builder's hand, the blocks ready

dug and brought, his work resembles one of
the two kinds of Discovery just mentioned,
viz. that to which we have assigned the name
of instruction: but if his materials are to be

entirely, or in part, provided by himself—if
he himself is forced to dig fresh blocks from

the quarry, this corresponds to the other kind
of Discovery.

rºup.
*

I have hitherto spoken of the employment
of argument in the establishment of those hy

pothetical Truths (as they may be called)

which relate only to our own abstract notions;
it is not, however, meant to be insinuated that

there is no room for Reasoning in the establish
ment of a matter of fact; but the other class of
Truths have first been treated of, because, in

discussing subjects of that kind, the process of
Reasoning is always the principal, and often the
only thing to be attended to, if we are but cer
tain and clear as to the meaning of the terms;

whereas, when assertions respecting real exist

ence are introduced, we have the additional
and more important business of ascertaining

and keeping in mind the degree of eridence
for those facts; since, otherwise, our Conclu
sions could not be relied on, however accurate

our Reasoning; but, undoubtedly, we may by

Reasoning arrive at matters of fact, if we have
matters of fact to set out with as data ; only
that it will very often happen that, “from cer
tain facts,” as Campbell remarks, “we draw

only probable Conclusions;” because the
other Premiss introduced (which he over
looked) is only probable. He observed that
in such an instance, for example, as the one

lately given, we infer from the certainly that

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

227

such and such tyrannies have been short-lived,
the probability that others will be so; and he
did not consider that there is an understood

Premiss which is essential to the argument;
(rig. that all tyrannies will resemble those we

have already observed) which being only of a
probable character, must attach the same

degree of uncertainty to the Conclusion.* An

individual fact is not unfrequently elicited by
skilfully combining, and Reasoning from, those
already known; of which many curious cases
occur in the detection of criminals by officers

of justice, and Barristers, who acquire by prac
tice such dexterity in that particular depart
ment, as to draw sometimes the right Conclu
sion from data, which might be in the posses
sion of others, without being applied to the
same use.

In all cases of the establishment of

a general fact from Induction, that general fact
(as has been formerly remarked) is ultimately
established by Reasoning; e. g. Bakewell, the
celebrated cattle-breeder, observed, in a great
number of individual beasts, a tendency to fat
ten readily, and in a great number of others the
* And the doubtfulness is multiplied, if both Premises
are uncertain. For since it is only on the supposition of
both Premises being true, that we can calculate on the
truth of the Conclusion, we must state in numbers the

chances against each Premiss being true, and then multi

ply these together, to judge of the degree of evidence of the
Conclusion.

absence of this constitution: in every indivi
dual of the former description, he observed a
certain peculiar make, though they differed
widely in size, colour, &c. Those of the latter
description differed no less in various points, but
agreed in being of a different make from the
others: these facts were his data; from which,

combining them with the general principle,

that Nature is steady and uniform in her pro
ceedings, he logically drew the conclusion, that
beasts of the specified make have universally
a peculiar tendency to fattening : but then
his principal merit consisted in making the
observations, and in so combining them as to
abstract from each of a multitude of cases, dif
fering widely in many respects, the circum
stances in which they all agreed; and also in
conjecturing skilfully how far those circum
stances were likely to be found in the whole
class: the making of such observations, and still
more the combination, abstraction, and judg
ment employed, are what men commonly mean
(as was above observed) when they speak of
Induction ; and these operations are certainly
distinct from Reasoning. The same observa
tions will apply to numberless other cases; as,

for instance, to the Discovery of the law of
“vis inertia,” and the other principles of Na
tural Philosophy.
But to what class, it may be asked, should

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH,

229

be referred the Discoveries thus made? All

would agree in calling them, when first ascer
tained, “New Truths,” in the strictest sense

of the word; which would seem to imply their
belonging to the class which may be called, by
way of distinction, “Physical Discoveries :" and

yet their being ultimately established by Rea
soning, would seem, according to the forego
ing rule, to refer them to the other class, viz.

what may be called “Logical Discoveries;" ºpir
since whatever is established by Reasoning
must have been containcid and virtually assert
ed in the Premises.

In answer to this, it is to

be observed, that they certainly do belong to

the latter class, relatively to a person who is in
possession of the data: but to him who is not,
they are New Truths of the other class; for it
is to be remembered, that the words “Disco

very” and “New Truths” are necessarily rela
tive: there may be a proposition which is to
one person absolutely known ; to another (viz.
one to whom it has never occurred, though he
is in possession of all the data from which it
may be proved) it will be (when he comes to

perceive it, by a process of instruction) what
we have called a Logical Discovery: to a third
(viz. one who is ignorant of these data) it will

be absolutely unknown, and will have been,
when made known to him, a perfectly and

properly New Truth,-a piece of information,

230

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

—a Physical Discovery, as we have called it.*
To the Philosopher, therefore, who arrives at
the Discovery by Reasoning from his observa
tions, and from established principles combined
with them, the Discovery is of the former
class; to the multitude, probably, of the latter,

as they will have been most likely not possessed
of all his data.

It follows from what has been said, that in

Mathematics, and in such Ethical propositions
as we were lately speaking of, we do not allow
the possibility of any but a Logical Discovery :

i. e. no proposition, of that class, can be true,
which was not implied in the definitions and
axioms we set out with, which are the first

principles: for since these propositions do not
profess to state any matter of fact, the only
Truth they can possess, consists in conformity
to the original principles; to one, therefore,

who knows these principles, such propositions
* It may be worth while in this place to define what is
properly to be called Knowledge: it implies three things;
1st, firm belief, 2dly, of what is true, 3dly, on sufficient
grounds. If any one e. g. is in doubt respecting one of
Euclid's demonstrations, he cannot be said to know the

proposition proved by it: if, again, he is fully convinced
of any thing that is not true, he is mistaken in supposing

himself to know it; lastly, if two persons are each fully
confident, one that the moon is inhabited, and the other

that it is not, (though one of these opinions must be true)
neither of them could properly be said to know the truth,
nce he cannot have sufficient proof of it.

231

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH,

are Truths already implied, since they may be
developed to him by Reasoning, if he is not
defective in the discursive faculty; and again,
to one who does not understand those princi

ples (i.e., is not master of the definitions) such
propositions are absolutely unmeaning. On
the other hand, propositions relating to mat

ters of fact, may be, indeed, implied in what he
already knew ; (as he who knows the climate
of the Alps, the Andes, &c. &c. has virtually
admitted the general fact, that “the tops of
mountains are comparatively cold") but as these

possess an absolute and physical Truth, they

may also be absolutely “new,” their Truth
not being implied by the mere terms of the pro

positions. The truth or falsity of any propo
sition concerning a triangle, is implied by the

meaning of that and of the other Geometrical
terms; whereas, though one may understand

(in the ordinary sense of that word) the full
meaning of the terms “planet,” and “inha
bited,” and of all the other terms in the lan
guage, he cannot thence be certain that the
moon is, or is not, inhabited.

§. 3.

It has probably been the source of much

perplexity, that the term “true" has been ap
plied indiscriminately to two such different

classes of propositions. The term definition is

232

used with the same laxity; and much confu
sion has thence resulted.

Such Definitions as

the Mathematical, must imply every attribute
that belongs to the thing defined; because that
thing is merely our meaning ; which meaning
the Definition lays down; whereas, real sub
stances, having an independent existence, may

possess innumerable qualities (as Locke ob
serves) not implied in the meaning we attach
to their names, or, as Locke expresses it, in
our ideas of them.

tions.

“Their nominal essence (to use his language)
is not the same as their real essence ;" whereas
the nominal cssence, and the real essence, of a
Circle, &c. are the same. A Mathematical

Definition, therefore, cannot properly be called
true, since it is not properly a proposition,”
(any more than an article in a Dictionary,) but
merely an explanation of the meaning of a
Term. Perhaps in Definitions of this class, it
might be better to substitute (as Aristotle
usually does) the imperative mood for the indi
cative; thus bringing them into the form of
postulates ; for the Definitions and the Postu
* I mean, in this place, that expression of a Definition in
which the name is conjoined with that which is, properly
speaking, the definition of it, in the form of a proposition:
as, e.g. “a Triangle is a plane superficial figure bounded
by three sides:” the words in italics are what, strictly
speaking, constitute the Definition; but what I am here
speaking of is the whole sentence,

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

233

lates in Mathematics differ in little or nothing
but the form of expression: e.g. “let a four

sided figure, of equal sides and right angles, be
called a square,” would clearly imply that such
a figure is conceivable, and that the writer in
tended to employ that term to signify such a
figure; which is precisely all that is meant to
be asserted.

If, indeed, a Mathematical writer

mean to assert that the ordinary sense of the
term is that which he has given, that, certainly,
is a proposition, which must be either true or
false; but in defining a new term, though the
term indeed may be ill chosen and improper,
or the Definition may be self-contradictory,
and consequently unintelligible, the words
“true,” and “false,” do not apply. The same

may be said of what are called nominal Defini
tions of other things, i. e. those which merely
explain the meaning of the word; viz. they
can be true or false only when they profess

(and so far as they profess) to give the ordinary
and established meaning of the Term. But
those which are called real Definitions, viz.

which unfold the nature of the thing, (which

they may do in various degrees,) to these the
epithet “true” may be applied; and to make
out such a Definition will often be the very

end (not as in Mathematics the beginning) of
our study.

In Mathematics there is no such distinction

234

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

between nominal and real Definition; the mean

ing of the term, and the nature of the thing,
being one and the same ; so that no correct De
finition whatever of any Mathematical term can
be devised, which shall not imply every thing

which belongs to the term.
§. 4.

Aºyd When it is asked, then, whether such great
* Discoveries, as have been made in Natural
Philosophy, were accomplished, or can be ac
complished, by Reasoning? the inquirer should
be reminded, that the question is ambiguous;

it may be answered in the affirmative, if by
“Reasoning” is meant to be included the as

sumption of Premises. To the right performance
of that work, is requisite, not only, in many
cases, the ascertainment of facts, and of the
degree of evidence for doubtful propositions,
(in which observation and experiment will
often be indispensable,) but also a skilful selec
tion and combination of known facts and prin
ciples ; such as implies, amongst other things,
the exercise of that powerful abstraction which

seizes the common circumstances—the point
of agreement—in a number of, otherwise, dis
similar individuals; and it is in this that the

greatest genius is shown. But if “Reasoning”
be understood in the limited sense in which it

is usually defined, then we must answer in the

-

235.

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

negative ; and reply that such Discoveries ar

made by means of Reasoning combined with
other operations.

-

In the process we have been speaking of,
there is much Reasoning throughout ; and
thence the whole has been carelessly called a
“process of Reasoning.”
It is not, indeed, any just ground of com

plaint that the word Reasoning is used in two
senses; but that the two senses are perpetually
confounded together: and hence it is that some

Logical writers fancied that Reasoning (viz.
that which Logic treats of) was the method of

discovering Truth ; and that so many other
writers have accordingly complained of Logic
for not accomplishing that end; urging that
“Syllogism (i. e. Reasoning; though they
overlooked the coincidence) never established
any thing that is, strictly speaking, unknown to
him who has granted the Premises: and pro
posing the introduction of a certain “rational

Logic” to accomplish this purpose; i. e. to di
rect the mind in the progress of investigation.
Supposing that some such system could be
devised—that it could even be brought into a

scientific form, (which he must be more san
guine than scientific who expects,)—that it
were of the greatest conceivable utility,+and
that it should be allowed to bear the name of

“Logic,” (since it would not be worth while

236

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

to contend about a name) still it would not, as
these writers seem to suppose, have the same
object proposed with the Aristotelian Logic;
nor be in any respect a rival to that system.
A plough may be a much more ingenious and
valuable instrument than a flail, but it never
can be substituted for it.

Those Discoveries ofgeneral laws of Nature,
&c. of which we have been speaking, being of
that character which we have described by the
name of “Logical Discoveries,” to him who is

in possession of all the Premises from which they
are deduced ; but being, to the multitude (who
are unacquainted with many of those Premises)
strictly “New Truths,” hence it is, that men
in general give to the general facts, and to

them, most peculiarly, the name of Discoveries;
for to themselves they are such, in the strictest
sense; the Premises from which they were
inferred being not only originally unknown to

them, but frequently remaining unknown to the
very last; e.g. the general conclusion concern
ing cattle, which Bakewell made known, is

what most Agriculturists (and many others
also) are acquainted with ; but the Premises
he set out with, viz. the facts respecting this,
that, and the other, individual ox, (the ascer

tainment of which facts was his first Discocery.)
these are what few know, or care to know,

with any exact particularity.

DISCOVERY OF TRUTII.

237

And it may be added, that these discoveries º:
of particular facts, which are the immediate re-".
sult of observation, are, in themselves, uninte
resting and insignificant, till they are combined
so as to lead to a grand general result; those
who on each occasion watched the motions,

and registered the times of occultation of Ju
piter's satellites, little thought, perhaps, them
selves, what magnificent results they were pre
paring the way for. So that there is an addi
tional cause which has confined the term Dis

covery to these grand general conclusions;
and, as was just observed, they are, to the ge
nerality of men, perfectly New Truths in the

strictest sense of the word, not being implied
in any previous knowledge they possessed.
Very often it will happen, indeed, that the con
clusion thus drawn will amount only to a pro
bable conjecture ; which conjecture will dictate

to the inquirer such an experiment, or course of
experiments, as will fully establish the fact:
thus Sir H. Davy, from finding that the flame
of hydrogen gas was not communicated through
a long slender tube, conjectured that a shorter
but still slenderer tube would answer the same

purpose; this led him to try the experiments,
in which, by continually shortening the tube,
and at the same time lessening its bore, he

arrived at last at the wire-gauze of his safety

lamp,

23S

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

It is to be observed also, that whatever cre

dit is conveyed by the word “Discovery,” to
him who is regarded as the author of it, is well
deserved by those who skilfully select and com
bine known Truths (especially such as have
been long and generally known) so as to elicit

important, and hitherto unthought-of, conclu
sions; their's is the master mind: apx|rex.rovizh
£pºnsis. Whereas men of very inferior powers

may sometimes, by immediate observation, dis–
cover perfectly new facts, empirically; and thus
be of service in furnishing materials to the
others; to whom they stand in the same rela
tion (to recur to a former illustration) as the
brickmaker or stone-quarrier, to the architect.
It is peculiarly creditable to Adam Smith, and to
Mr. Malthus, that the data from which they

drew such important Conclusions had been in
every one's hands for centuries.

As for Mathematical Discoveries, they (as
we have before said) must always be of the de
scription to which we have given the name of
“Logical Discoveries;” since to him who pro
perly comprehends the meaning of the Mathe
matical terms, (and to no other are the Truths

themselves, properly speaking, intelligible)
those results are implied in his previous know

ledge, since they are Logically deducible there
from. It is not, however, meant to be implied,
that Mathematical Discoveries are cſected by

pure Reasoning, and by that singly.

239

For

though there is not here, as in Physics, any

exercise of judgment as to the degree of evi
dence of the Premises, nor any experiments

and observations, yet there is the same call for
skill in the selection and combination of the Pre
mises in such a manner as shall be best calcu

lated to lead to a new, that is, unperceived and

wnthought-of Conclusion.
In following, indeed, and taking in a demon
stration, nothing is called for but pure Reason
ing; but the assumption of Premises is not a
part of Reasoning, in the strict and technical
sense of that term. Accordingly, there are

many who can follow a Mathematical demon
stration, or any other train of argument, who
would not succeed well in framing one of their
own.”

addition (generally speaking) to that process,
observation and experiment. It will generally
happen, that in the study of nature, and, uni
versally, in all that relates to matters of fact,

both kinds of investigation will be united; i.e.
some of the facts or principles you reason from
as Premises, must be ascertained by observa
tion ; or, as in the case of the safety-lamp, the
ultimate Conclusion will need confirmation from
experience; so that both Physical and Logical
Discovery will take place in the course of the
same process: we need not, therefore, wonder,
that the two are so perpetually confounded. In
Mathematics, on the other hand, and in great
part of the discussions relating to Ethics and
Jurisprudence, there being no room for any

Physical Discovery whatever, we have only to
make a skilful use of the propositions in our
possession, to arrive at every attainable re
sult.

The investigation, however, of the latter

class of subjects differs in other points also
from that of the former; for, setting aside the

circumstance of our having, in these, no ques

may be called, in both instances, the process

of Logical investigation; the Premises on which

tWO CaSeS.

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

241

To take the example of Mathematics, the Nº.
Definitions, which are the principles of our *
Reasoning, are very few, and the Axioms still
fewer; and both are, for the most part, laid
down and placed before the student in the outset;
the introduction of a new Definition or Axiom,
being of comparatively rare occurrence, at
wide intervals, and with a formal statement; be
sides which, there is no room for doubt concern
ing either. On the other hand, in all Reason
ings which regard matters of fact, we introduce,
almost at every step, fresh and fresh proposi
tions (to a very great number) which had not
been elicited in the course of our Reasoning,
but are taken for granted; viz. facts and laws
of Nature, which are here the principles of our
Reasoning, and maxims, or “elements of be
lief,” which answer to the axioms in Mathe
matics. If, at the opening of a Treatise, for
example, on Chemistry, on Agriculture, on
Political Economy, &c. the author should
make, as in Mathematics, a formal statement of
all the propositions he intended to assume as

granted throughout the whole work, both he
and his readers would be astonished at the

number; and, of these, many would be only
probable, and there would be much room for
doubt as to the degree of probability, and for
judgment, in ascertaining that degree.
Moreover, Mathematical axioms are always

employed precisely in the same simple form ;
e.g. the axiom that “things equal to the same
are equal to one another,” is cited, whenever
there is need, in those very words ; whereas

the maxims employed in the other class of
subjects, admit of, and require, continual mo
difications in the application of them: e. g.

“the stability of the laws of Nature,” which is
our constant assumption in inquiries relating
to Natural Philosophy, assumes many different
shapes, and in some of them does not possess
the same absolute certainty as in others: e. g.
when, from having always observed a certain

sheep ruminating, we infer, that this individual
sheep will continue to ruminate, we assume

that “the property which has hitherto belonged
to this sheep will remain unchanged;” when we
infer the same property of all sheep, we assume

that “the property which belongs to this indivi
dual belongs to the whole species:" if, on com
paring sheep with some other kinds of horned

animals, and finding thatall agree in ruminating,
we infer that “all horned animals ruminate,” we

assume that “the whole of a genus or class are
likely to agree in any point wherein many spe

cies of that genus agree;” or in other words,
“that if one of two properties, &c. has often

been found accompanied by another, and never
without it, the former will be universally ac
companied by the latter:” now all these are

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH.

243

merely different forms of the maxim, that
“nature is uniform in her operations,” which,

it is evident, varies in expression in almost
every different case where it is applied, and

admits of every degree of evidence, from abso
lute moral certainty, to mere conjecture.
The same may be said of an infinite number
of principles and maxims appropriated to, and
employed in, each particular branch of study.
Hence, all such Reasonings are, in comparison

of Mathematics, very complex; requiring so
much more than that does, beyond the process
of merely deducing the conclusion Logically
from the Premises: so that it is no wonder

that the longest Mathematical demonstration
should be so much more easily constructed and
understood, than a much shorter train of just

Reasoning concerning real facts. The former
has been aptly compared to a long and steep,

but even and regular, flight of steps, which tries
the breath, and the strength, and the perse
verance only; while the latter resembles a
short, but rugged and uneven, ascent up a pre

cipice, which requires a quick eye, agile limbs,
and a firm step; and in which we have to
tread now on this side, now on that—ever con

sidering, as we proceed, whether this or that
projection will afford room for our foot, or

whether some loose stone may not slide from
under us. There are probably as many steps

of pure Reasoning in one of the longer of Eu
clid's demonstrations, as in the whole of an

argumentative treatise on some other subject,
occupying perhaps a considerable volume.
As for those Ethical and Legal Reasonings
which were lately mentioned, as in some re
spects resembling those of Mathematics, (viz.
such as keep clear of all assertions respecting
facts) they have this difference; that not only

men are not so completely agreed respecting
the maxims and principles of Ethics and Law,
but the meaning also of each term cannot be

absolutely, and for ever, fixed by an arbitrary

definition; on the contrary, a great part of our
labour consists in distinguishing accurately the
various senses in which men employ each
term, ascertaining which is the most proper,

—and taking care to avoid confounding them
together.

245

CHAPTER III.

OF INFERENCE AND PROOF.

§. 1.
SINCE it appears, from what has been said, that
universally a man must possess something else
-

besides the Reasoning-faculty, in order to apply
that faculty properly to his own purpose, what

ever that purpose may be; it may be inquired
whether some theory could not be made out,
respecting those “other operations,” and “intel
lectual processes, distinct from . Reasoning,
which it is necessary for us sometimes to em

ploy in the investigation of truth;” and whe
ther rules could not be laid down for conduct

ing them.
Something has, indeed, been done in this ...

way by more than one writer; and more might “
probably be accomplished by one who should
fully comprehend and carefully bear in mind

the principles of Logic, properly so called; but

it would hardly be possible to build up any
thing like a regular Science respecting these
matters, such as Logic is, with respect to the
* D. Stewart,

246

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

theory of Reasoning. It may be useful, how
ever, to observe, that these “other operations”
of which we have been speaking, and which
are preparatory to the exercise of Reasoning,
are of two kinds, according to the nature of the
end proposed; for Reasoning comprehends In
ferring and Proving ; which are not two dif
ferent things, but the same thing regarded in
two different points of view : (like the road
from London to York, and the road from York

to London) he who infers,” proves; and he
who proves, infers; but the word “infer” fixes
the mind first on the Premiss, and then on the
Conclusion; the word “prove,” on the con
trary, leads the mind from the Conclusion to
the Premiss.

Hence, the substantives derived

from these words respectively, are often used
to express that which, on each occasion, is last

in the mind; Inference being often used to sig
nify the Conclusion (i. e. Proposition inferred)
and Proof, the Premiss. We say, also, “How
do you prove that " and “What do you infer
jrom that?” which sentences would not be so

properly expressed if we were to transpose
those verbs.

One might, therefore, define

Proving, “the assigning of a reason or argu
ment for the support of a given proposition;"
and “Inferring,” the “ deduction of a Conclu.
* I mean, of course, when the word is understood to
imply correct Inference,

-

INFERENCE AND PROOF.

247

sion from given Premises.” In the one case our
Conclusion is given, (i.e. set before us) and we
have to seek for arguments; in the other, our
Premises are given, and we have to seek for a
Conclusion; i. e. to put together our own pro
positions, and try what will follow from them;
or, to speak more Logically, in the one case,
we seek to refer the Subject of which we
would predicate something, to a class to which

that Predicate will (affirmatively or negatively)
apply; in the other, we seek to find compre
hended, in the Subject of which we have predi
cated something, some other term to which
that Predicate had not been before applied.*
Each of these is a definition of Reasoning.
§. 2.

To infer, then, is the business of the Philo- º
sopher; to prove, of the Advocate; the former, *
from the great mass of known and admitted
truths, wishes to elicit any valuable additional
truth whatever, that has been hitherto unper
ceived; and, perhaps, without knowing, with
certainty, what will be the terms of his Con
clusion. Thus the Mathematician, e. g. seeks
to ascertain what is the ratio of circles to each
* “Proving” may be compared to the act of putting
away any article into the proper receptacle of goods of
that description; “inferring,” to that of bringing out the
article when needed.

other, or what is the line whose square will be
equal to a given circle: the Advocate, on the
other hand, has a Proposition put before him,
which he is to maintain as well as he can: his

business, therefore, is to find middle terms
(which is the inventio of Cicero); the Philoso

pher's, to combine and select known facts, or
principles, suitably, for gaining from them Con
clusions which, though implied in the Pre
mises, were before unperceived: in other
words, for making “Logical Discoveries.”
Such are the respective preparatory pro

cesses in these two branches of study. They
are widely different;-they arise from, and
generate, very different habits of mind; and
require a very different kind of training and
precept.* The Lawyer, or Controversialist,
or, in short, the Rhetorician in general, who is,
in his own province, the most skilful, may be

but ill-fitted for Philosophical investigation,
even where there is no observation wanted ;-

when the facts are all ready ascertained for him.
And again, the ablest Philosopher may make
* It is evident that the business of the Advocate and that

of the Judge are in this manner opposed; the one being,
to find arguments for the support of his client's cause, the
other, to ascertain the truth.

And hence it is, that those

who have excelled the most in the former department,
sometimes manifest a deficiency in the latter, though the
subject-matter, in which they are conversant, remains the
Saule,

an indifferent disputant; especially, since the
arguments which have led him to the conclu
sion, and have, with him, the most weight,
may not, perhaps, be the most powerful in
controversy. The commonest fault, however,

by far, is to forget the Philosopher or Theolo
gian, and to assume the Advocate, improperly.
It is therefore of great use to dwell on the
distinction between these two branches.

As

for the bare process of Reasoning, that is the
same in both cases; but the preparatory pro
cesses which are requisite, in order to employ
Reasoning profitably, these, we see, branch off
into two distinct channels. In each of these,
undoubtedly, useful rules may be laid down;
but they should not be confounded together.
Bacon has chosen the department of Philoso- º
phy, giving rules in his Organon, not only for
the conduct of experiments to ascertain new
facts, but also for the selection and combina
tion of known facts and principles, with a view
of obtaining valuable Inferences; and it is pro
bable that a system of such rules is what some

writers mean (if they have any distinct mean
ing) by their proposed “Logic.”
In the other department, precepts have been inquiry.
Rhetorical

ters, as a part of their plan.

How far these

precepts are to be considered as belonging to
the present system,--whether “method" is to

250

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

be regarded as a part of Logic,+whether the
matter of Logic is to be included in the sys
tem,--whether Bacon's is properly to be
reckoned a kind of Logic;—all these are
merely verbal questions, relating to the exten
sion, not of the Science, but of the name. The

bare process of Reasoning, i. e. deducing a
Conclusion from Premises, must ever remain a

distinct operation from the assumption of Pre

mises, however useful the rules maybe that have
been given, or may be given, for conducting this
latter process, and others connected with it;

and however properly such rules may be sub
joined to the precepts of that system to which
the name of Logic is applied in the narrowest

sense. Such rules as I now allude to may be
of eminent service; but they must always be,
as I have before observed, comparatively vague
and general, and incapable of being built up
into a regular demonstrative theory like that of

the Syllogism; to which theory they bear much
the same relation as the principles and rules of
Poetical and Rhetorical criticism to those of

Grammar; or those of practical Mechanics, to

strict Geometry. I find no fault with the ex
tension of a term; but I would suggest a cau
tion against confounding together, by means of
a common name, things essentially different;

and above all I would deprecate the sophistry
of striving to depreciate what is called “the

INFERENCE AND PROOF.

251

school Logic,” by perpetually contrasting it
with systems with which it has nothing in
common but the name, and whose object is
essentially different.
§. 3.
It is not a little remarkable that writers, *::::::::
anon and
Bacon's.

whose expressions tend to confound together,
by means of a common name, two branches of
study which have nothing else in common (as

if they were two different plans for attaining
one and the same object), have themselves com

plained of one of the effects of this confusion,
viz. the introduction, early in the career of

Academical Education, of a course of Logic;
under which name, they observe, “men now
universally comprehend the works of Locke,
Bacon, &c.” which, as is justly remarked, are

unfit for beginners. Now this would not have
happened, if men had always kept in mind the
meaning or meanings of each name they used.

And it may be added, that, however justly the
word Logic may be thus extended, we have no
ground for applying to the Aristotelian Logic

the remarks above quoted respecting the Ba
conian; which the ambiguity of the word, if
not carefully kept in view, might lead us to do.
Grant that Bacon's work is a

part of Logic; it

no more follows, from the unfitness of that for

learners, that the Elements of the Theory of

252

oN THE PRovince of REASONING.

Reasoning should be withheld from them,
than it follows that the elements of Euclid,
and common Arithmetic, are unfit for boys,
because Newton's Principia, which also bears
the title of Mathematical, is above their grasp.
Of two branches of study which bear the same
name, or even of two parts of the same
branch, the one may be suitable to the com
mencement, the other to the close, of the Aca
demical career.

At whatever period of that career it may be
proper to introduce the study of such as are
usually called Metaphysical writers, it may be
safely asserted, that those who have had the
most experience in the business of giving in
struction in Logic, properly so called, together
with other branches of knowledge, prefer and

generally pursue the plan of letting their pupils
enter on that study, next in order after the cle
ments of Mathematics.

253

CHAPTER IV.

OF VERBAL AND REAL QUESTIONS.

§. l.

THE ingenious author of the Philosophy of
Rhetoric having maintained, or rather assumed,
that Logic is applicable to Verbal controversy
alone, there may be an advantage (though it
has been my aim throughout to show the ap
plication of it to all Reasoning) in pointing
out the difference between Verbal and Real

Questions, and the probable origin of Camp
bell's mistake; for to trace any error to its
source, will often throw more light on the sub
ject in hand than can be obtained if we rest
satisfied with merely detecting and refuting it.
Every Question that can arise, is in fact a

Question whether a certain Predicate is or is
not applicable to a certain subject, or what
Predicate is applicable; and whatever other ac
count may be given by any writer of the nature
of any matter of doubt or debate, will be
found, ultimately, to resolve itself into this.
But sometimes the Question turns on the
meaning and extent of the terms employed;

sometimes on the things signified by them. If
it be made to appear, therefore, that the oppo

254

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

site sides of a certain Question may be held by
persons not differing in their opinion of the
matter in hand, then that Question may be
pronounced Verbal; as depending on the dif
ferent senses in which they respectively employ

the terms.

If, on the contrary, it appears that

they employ the terms in the same sense,

but

still differ as to the application of one of them
to the other, then it may be pronounced that

the Question is Real,—that they differ as to the
opinions they hold of the things in Question.
If, for instance, two persons contend whe
ther Augustus deserved to be called a “great
man,” then, if it appeared that the one included,
under the term “great,” disinterested pa
triotism, and on that ground excluded Augustus

from the class, as wanting in that quality; and
that the other also gave him no credit for that
quality, but understood no more, by the term

“great,” than high intellectual qualities, energy
of character, and brilliant actions, it would fol
low that the parties did not differ in opinion
except as to the use of a term, and that the

Question was Verbal. If, again, it appeared
that the one did give Augustus credit for such
patriotism as the other deniedhim, both of them

including that idea in the term great, then the
Question would be Real. Either kind of
Question, it is plain, is to be argued according
to Logical principles; but the middle terms

VERBAL AND REAL QUESTIONS.

255

employed would be different; and for this reason,
among others, it is important to distinguish
Verbal from Real controversy. In the former

case, e. g. it might be urged with truth, that
the common use of the expression “great and
good” proves that the idea of good is not im

plied in the ordinary sense of the word great;
an argument which could have, of course, no

place in deciding the other Question.
§. 3.

It is by no means to be supposed that all yellºws:
Questions are trifling and frivolous; it ****
is often of the highest importance to settle
correctly the meaning of a word, either accord
ing to ordinary use, or according to the mean
ing of any particular writer, or class of men;
but when Verbal Questions are mistaken for
Verbal

Real, much confusion of thought and unpro

fitable wrangling will be generally the result.
Nor is it always so easy and simple a task, as
might at first sight appear, to distinguish them
from each other: for several objects to which
one common name is applied will often have
many points of difference, and yet that name
may perhaps be applied to them all in the same

sense, and may be fairly regarded as the genus
they come under, if it appear that they all

agree in what is designated by that name, and
that the differences between them are in points

256

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

not essential to the character of the genus. A

cow and a horse differ in many respects, but
agree in all that is implied by the term “qua
druped,” which is therefore applicable to both
in the same sense.

So also the houses of the

ancients differed in many respects from ours,
and their ships still more; yet no one would
contend that the terms “house” and “ship,” as

applied to both, were ambiguous, or that of,or
might not fairly be rendered house, and yaws
ship ; because the essential characteristic of a
house is, not its being of this or that form or
materials, but its being a dwelling for men;
these therefore would be called two different
kinds of houses; and consequently the term

“house” would be applied to each, without any
equivocation, in the same sense: and so in the
other instances.

On the other hand, two or

more things may bear the same name, and may
also have a resemblance in many points, and
may from that resemblance have come to bear
the same name, and yet if the circumstance
which is essential to each be wanting in the
other, the term may be pronounced ambiguous:
e.g. The word “Priest” is applied to the mi
nisters of the Jewish and of the Pagan reli

gions, and also to those of the Christian ; and
doubtless the term is so used in consequence of

their being both ministers (in some sort) of
religion.

Nor would every difference that

VERBAL AND REAL QUESTIONS.

257

might be found between the Priests of differ

ent religions constitute the term ambiguous,
provided such differences were non-essential

to the idea suggested by the word Priest'; as,
e.g. the Jewish Priest served the true God,

and the Pagan, false Gods: this is a most im
portant difference, but does not constitute the
term ambiguous, because neither of these cir

cumstances is implied and suggested by the
term ‘Ipsºs ; which accordingly was applied

both to Jewish and Pagan Priests. But the
term ‘Ispsès does seem to have implied the office
of offering sacrifice, atoning for the sins of the
people, and acting as mediator between man
and the object of his worship; and accordingly
that term is never applied to any one under
the Christian system, except to the ONE great
Mediator.

The Christian ministers not hav

ing that office which was implied as essential
in the term ‘Ispºs, were never called by that
It may be
concluded, therefore, that the term Priest is
ambiguous, as corresponding to the terms

‘Isgºs and rpg.cgi/repos respectively, notwithstand
ing that there are points in which these two
agree. These therefore should be reckoned,
not two different kinds of Priests, but Priests in

is remarkable) is never translated “Priest” in our version
of the Scriptures, but “Elder.”
S

258

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

two different senses ; since (to adopt the
phraseology of Aristotle) the definition of
them, so far forth as they are Priests, would
be different.

It is evidently of much importance to keep
in mind the above distinctions, in order to

avoid, on the one hand, stigmatizing as Verbal
controversies, what in reality are not such,
merely because the Question turns on the ap
plicability of a certain Predicate to a certain
subject; or, on the other hand, falling into the

opposite error of mistaking words for things,
and judging of men's agreement or disagree
ment in opinion in every case, merely from

their agreement or disagreement in the terms
employed.

259

CHAPTER W.

OF REALISM.

§. 1.
Nothing has a greater tendency to lead to the
mistake just noticed, and thus to produce un

detected Verbal Questions and fruitless Logo
machy, than the prevalence of the notion of
the Realists,” that genus and species are some
real THINGs, existing independently of our
conceptions and expressions; and that, as in

the case of singular terms, there is some real
individual corresponding to each, so in com
mon terms, also, there is something corre

sponding to each, which is the object of our
thoughts when we employ any such term.i.
* It is well known what a long and furious controversy
long existed in all the universities of Europe between the
sects of the Realists and the Nominalists; the heat of which

was allayed by the Reformation, which withdrew men's at
tention to a more important question.
tº A doctrine commonly, but falsely, attributed to
Aristotle, who expressly contradicts it. He calls in

and Species “secondary,” as not denoting (700e tº) a

There is one circumstance which ought to

be noticed, as having probably contributed not

a little to foster this error: I mean the pecu
liar technical sense of the word “Species”
when applied to organized Beings. It has been
laid down in the course of this work, that when
several individuals are observed to resemble

each other in some point, a common name may
be assigned to them denoting that point, ap
plying to all or any of them so far forth as
respects that common attribute, and distin

guishing them from all others; as, e.g., the se
veral individual buildings, which, however dif
ferent in other respects, agree in being con

structed for men's dwelling, are called by the
common name of “ House:” and it was added,
that as we select at pleasure the circumstance
that we choose to abstract, we may thus refer

the same individual to several different species,
according as it suits our purpose; and the same
in respect of the reference of Species to Genus:
whence it seems plainly to follow that Genus

and Species are no real things existing inde
pendent of our thoughts, but are creatures of

our own minds. Yet in the case of Species of
organized Beings, it seems at first sight as if

this rule did not hold good; but that the Spe
cies to which each individual belongs, could not

be in any degree arbitrarily fixed by us, but
must be something real, unalterable, and inde
pendent of our thoughts. Caesar or Socrates
for instance, it may be said, must belong to the
Species, Man, and can belong to no other:
and the like, with any individual Brute, or
Plant. On the other hand, if any one utters

such a proposition as “Argus was a mastiff.”
to what head of Predicables would this Predi

cate be referred Surely our logical principles
would lead us to answer, that it is the Species;

since it could hardly be called an Accident,
and is manifestly no other Predicable. But
every Naturalist would at once pronounce that
Mastiff is no distinct Species, but only a variety
of the Species Dog. This however does not

satisfy our inquiry as to the head of Predica
bles to which it is to be referred.

The solu

tion of the difficulty is to be found in the con
sideration of the peculiar technical sense of the
word “Species” when applied to organized
Beings : in which case it is always applied ãº,

to such individuals as are supposed to be
descended from a common stock, or which might
have so descended; viz. which resemble one

much as those of the same stock do.

Now

this being a point on which all (not merely
Naturalists) are agreed, and since it is a matter

it follows,

every
question
whether

or Plant belongs to a certain Species or not, is

a question not of mere arrangement, but of fact.
But in the case of questions respecting Genus
it is otherwise. If, e.g., two Naturalists dif
fered in the one placing (as Linnaeus) all the

Species of Bee under one Genus, which the
other subdivided (as later writers have done)

into several genera, it would be evident that
there was no question of fact debated between
them, and that it was only to be considered
which was the more convenient arrangement; if,
on the other hand, it were disputed whether
the African and the Asiatic Elephant are dis

tinct Species, or merely Varieties, it would be
equally manifest that the question is one of
fact; since both would allow that if they were
descended (or might have descended) from the
same stock, they were of the same Species,
and if otherwise, of two: this is the fact, which

they endeavour to ascertain, by such indica
tions as are to be found.

For it is to be fur

ther observed, that this fact being one which
cannot be directly known, the consequence is,
that the marks by which any Species of Animal
or Plant is known, are not the very Differentia

263

which constitutes that Species. Now, in the Mºy

guished from other minerals, being the very
Differentia that constitutes the Species Dia
mond.

And the same is the case in the Ge

mera of organized beings likewise: the Lin
naean Genus “felis,” e.g., (when considered as

a Species) is distinguished from others under
the same Order, by those very marks which
constitute its Differentia.

But in the Infimae

Species (according to the view of a Naturalist)
of plants and animals, this, as has been said,
is not the case; since here the Differentia

which constitutes each Species includes in it a
circumstance which cannot be directly ascer
tained (viz. the being sprung from the same
stock), but which we conjecture from circum

stances of resemblance; so that the marks by
which a Species is known, are not in truth the
whole of the Differentia itself, but indications
of the existence of that Differentia; viz. indi
cations of descent from a common stock.*

* There are a few, and but a few, other Species to which
the same observations will in a great degree apply; I mean
in which the Differentia which constitutes the Species, and
the mark by which the Species is known, are not the same:
e.g. “Murder:” the Differentia of which is that it be com
mitted “with malice aforethought;" this cannot be directly
ascertained ; and therefore we distinguish a murder from

any other homicide by circumstances of preparation, &c.,

264

ON THE PROVINCE OF REASONING.

Hence it is that Species, in the case of or
ganized beings, appears to be something real,
and independent of our thoughts and language;
and hence, naturally enough, the same notions
have been often extended to the Genera also,

and to Species of other things : so that men
have an idea of each individual ofevery descrip
tion truly belonging to some one Species and
no other; and each Species in like manner to
some one Genus ; whether we happen to be
right or not in the ones to which we refer
them.

Few, if any indeed, in the present day avow
and maintain this doctrine; but those who are

not especially on their guard, are perpetually
sliding into it unawares.

when it is not clearly perceived and carefully
borne in mind, that they are employed in a
secondary sense, and that more frequently

even than in the primary.

are employed; so far all is clear: but suppose

the Differentia; i. e. grounds for concluding that the ma

all these persons are thinking of a Triangle;—
not any individual triangle, but Triangle in
general;—and considering, perhaps, the equal
ity of its angles to two right angles; it would
seem as if, in this case also, their minds were

all employed on “one and the same” object:
and this object of their thoughts, it may be
said, cannot be the mere word triangle, but that
which is meant by it; nor again, can it be

everything that the word will apply to, for
they are not thinking of triangles, but of one
thing. Those who do not acknowledge that
this “one thing" has an existence independent
of the human mind, are in general content to

tell us by way of explanation, that the object of
their thoughts is the abstract “idea” of a tri
angle;* an explanation which satisfies, or at

least silences many; though it may be doubted
whether they very clearly understand what
sort of a thing an “idea" is, which may thus
exist in a thousand different minds at once, and
yet be “one and the same.”
The fact is, that “unity” and “sameness”
are in such cases employed, not in the primary
sense, but to denote perfect similarity. When

we say that ten thousand different persons have
all “one and the same." Idea in their minds, or

who adopt this explanation; to which class Locke is re
ferred.

are all of “one and the same" Opinion, we

mean no more than that they are all think
ing exactly alike : when we say that they are
all in the “same” posture, we mean that they

are all placed alike, and so also they are said
all to have the “same” disease, when they are
all diseased alike.*
* One instance of the confusion of thought and endless

logomachy which may spring from inattention to this ambi
guity of the words “same,” &c. is afforded by the contro
versy arising out of a sermon of Dr. King (Archbishop of
Dublin), published about a century ago. He remarked
(without expressing himself perhaps with so much guarded
precision as the vehemence of his opponents rendered need
ful) that “the attributes of the Deity (viz.Wisdom, Justice,
&c.) are not to be regarded as the same with those human
qualities which bear the same names, but are called so by

resemblance and analogy only.” For this he was decried by
Bishop Berkeley and a host of other objectors, down to the
present time, as an Atheist, or little better. If the divine
attributes, they urged, are not precisely the same in kind
(though superior in degree) with the human qualities which
bear the same name, we cannot imitate the Deity as the
Scriptures require;—we cannot know on what principles
we shall be judged;— we cannot be sure that God exists at

all ; with a great deal more to the same purpose; all of
which would have been perceived to be entirely needless,
had the authors but recollected to ascertain the meaning of
the principal word employed. 1st. When any two persons
(or other objects) are said to have the “same” quality, ac
cident, &c., what we predicate of them is evidently a cer
tain resemblance, and nothing else. One man, e.g., does
not feel another's sickness; but they are said to have the
“same” disease, if they are precisely similar in respect of
their ailments: and so also they are said to have the same
complexion, if the hue and texture of their skins be alike.

2dly. Such qualities as are entirely relative, which consist

Origin of the
The origin of this secondary sense of the ambiguity
of

words, “ same,” “one,” “identical,” &c. (an
attention to which would clear away an incal

culable mass of confused Reasoning and Logo
machy,) is easily to be traced to the use of

Language and of other signs, for the purpose
in the relation borne by the subject to certain other things,
—in these, it is manifest, the only resemblance that can
exist, is, resemblance of relations, i. e. ANALOGY.

Courage, e.g., consists in the relation in which one stands
(é, Tig exei, Tws 7pos. Arist.) towards dangers; Tempe
rance or Intemperance, towards bodily pleasures, &c. When
it is said, therefore, of two courageous men, that they have
both the same quality, the only meaning this expression can

have, is, that they are, so far, completely analogous in their
characters ;-having similar ratios to certain similar ob

jects. In short, as, in all qualities, sameness can mean
only strict resemblance, so, in those which are of a relative
nature, resemblance can mean only analogy.

Thus it ap

pears, that what Dr. King has been so vehemently censured
for asserting respecting the Deity, is literally true even with
respect to men themselves: viz. that it is only by Analogy
that two persons can be said to possess the same virtue, or
other such quality. 3dly. But what he means is plainly, that
this analogy is far less eract and complete in the case of a
comparison between the Deity and his creatures, than be
tween one man and another; which surely no one would
venture to deny. But the doctrine against which the
attacks have been directed, is self-evident, the moment we

consider the meaning of the term employed.
In the introduction and notes to the last edition of Arch

bishop King's Discourse, I have considered the matters in
debate more fully; but this slight notice of them has been
introduced in this place, as closely connected with the pre
sent subject.

of mutual communication.

If any one utters

the “one single” word “triangle,” and gives
“one single" definition of it; each of the per
sons who hear him forms a certain notion in

his own mind, not differing in any respect from
that of each of the rest: they are said there
fore to have all “one and the same” notion,

because, resulting from, and corresponding
with, (that which is, in the primary sense)
“one and the same” expression; and there is
said to be “one single” idea of every triangle
(considered merely as a triangle,) because one
single name or definition is equally applicable
to each.

In like manner, all the coins struck

by the same single die, are said to have “one
and the same” impression, merely because
the one description which suits one of these
coins will equally suit any other that is exactly
like it.

It is not intended to recommend the disuse

of the words “ same,” “identical,” &c. in this
transferred sense; which, if it were desirable,
would be utterly impracticable; but merely a
steady attention to the ambiguity thus intro
duced, and watchfulness against the errors

thence arising. The difficulties and perplex
ities which have involved the questions re
specting personal identity, among others, may

be traced principally to the neglect of this

REALISM,

caution.*

269

Put a full consideration of that

question would be unsuitable to the subject of
this work.

* I mean that many writers have sought an explanation
of the primary sense of identity (viz. personal) by looking
to the secondary. Any grown man, e.g., is, in the primary
sense, the same person he was when a child: this same

ness is, I conceive, a simple motion, which it is vain to
attempt explaining by any other more simple; but when
philosophers seek to gain a clearer notion of it by looking
to the cases in which sameness is predicated in another
sense, viz. similarity, such as exists between several indivi

duals denoted by a common name, (as when we say that
there are growing on Lebanon some of the same trees with
which the temple was built, meaning cedars of that species)
this is surely as idle as if we were to attempt explaining the
primary sense, e. g., of “rage,” as it exists in the human
mind, by directing our attention to the “rage” of the sea.

Whatever personal identity does consist in, it is plain that
it has nothing to do with similarity; since every one would
be ready to say, “when I WAS a child, I thought as a
child,—I spake as a child,—I understood as a child; but
when I became a man, I put away childish things.”

ON CERTAIN TERMS WHICH ARE
BE

PECULIARLY LIABLE TO

USED AMBIGUOUSLY.

It has appeared to me desirable to illustrate the import
ance of attending to the ambiguity of terms by a greater
number of instances than could have been conveniently
either inserted in the context or introduced in a note, with
out too much interrupting the course of the discussion of
Fallacies.

-

The words and phrases which may be employed as am
biguous middle terms are of course innumerable; but it
may be in several respects of service to the learner, to ex
plain the ambiguity of a few of those most frequently oc
curring in the most important discussions, and whose
double meaning has been the most frequently overlooked:
and this, not by entering into an examination of all the
senses in which each term is ever employed, but of those

only which are the most liable to be confounded together.
It is worth observing, that the words whose ambiguity

is the most frequently overlooked, and is productive of the
greatest amount of confusion of thought and fallacy, are
among the commonest, and are those of whose meaning the
generality consider there is the least room to doubt. It is
T

indeed from these very circumstances that the danger
arises; words in very common use are both the most liable,
from the looseness of ordinary

discourse, to slide from one

sense into another, and also the least likely to have that
ambiguity suspected. Familiar acquaintance is perpe
tually mistaken for accurate knowledge.
-

ARGUMENT, in the strict logical sense, has been de
fined in the foregoing treatise; (Compendium, Part iii.
§. 1) in that sense it includes (as is there remarked) the
Conclusion as well as the

Premises; and thus it is, that

we say a Syllogism consists of three propositions; viz., the

Conclusion which is proved, as well as those by which it
is proved.

But in ordinary discourse, Argument is very often used
for the Premises alone, in contradistinction to the Conclu

sion; e.g. “the Conclusion which this Argument is in
tended to establish is so and so.”

It is also sometimes employed to denote what is, strictly

speaking, a course or series of such Arguments; when a
certain Conclusion is established by Premises, which are
themselves, in the same dissertation, proved by other pro

positions, and perhaps those again, by others; the whole of
this dissertation is often called an Argument to prove the
ultimate conclusion designed to be established; though in
fact it is a train of Arguments. It is in this sense, e.g.,
that we speak of “Warburton's Argument to prove the
divine legation of Moses,” &c.

Sometimes also the word is used to denote what may be
properly called a Disputation; i. e. two trains of argu

ment, opposed to each other: as when we say that A and
B had a long Argument on such and such a subject; and
that A had the best of the Argument. Doubtless the use
of the word in this sense has contributed to foster the

275

motion entertained by many, that Logic is the “art of
wrangling,” that it makes men contentious, &c.: they have
heard that it is employed about Arguments; and hastily
conclude that it is confined to cases where there is oppo
sition and contest.

It may be worth mentioning in this place, that the various
jorms of stating an Argument are sometimes spoken of as
different kinds of Argument: as when we speak of a Ca
tegorical or Hypothetical Argument, or of one in the first
or some other Figure; though every logician knows that

the same individual Argument may be stated in various
figures, &c.
This no doubt has contributed to the error of those who

speak of the Syllogism as a peculiar kind of Argument,

and of “Syllogistic Reasoning,” as a distinct mode of
Reasoning, instead of being only a certain form of express
Žng any argument.
CAN.—See “ MAY.”

CAPABLE.—See “PossIBLE,” “IMPossible,” and
“NEcess ARY.”

CASE.-Sometimes Grammarians use this word to sig
nify (which is its strict sense) a certain “variation in the
writing and utterance of a Noun, denoting the relation in
which it stands to some other part of the sentence;” some
times, to denote that relation itself; whether indicated by

the termination, or by a preposition, or by its collocation;
and there is hardly any writer on the Subject who does
not occasionally employ the term in each sense, without
explaining the ambiguity. Much confusion and frivolous
debate has hence resulted. Whoever would see a specimen

of this, may find it in the Port Royal Greek Grammar; in
T 2

which the Authors insist on giving the Greek language an
Ablative case, with the same termination, however, as the

Dative; (though, by the way, they had better have fixed
on the Genitive, which oftener answers to the Latin Abla

tive) urging, and with great truth, that if a distinct ter

mination be necessary to constitute a case, many Latin
Nouns will be without an Ablative, some without a Geni
tive or without a Dative, and all Neuters without an Ac

cusative.

And they add, that since it is possible, in every

instance, to render into Greek the Latin Ablative, conse

quently there must be an Ablative in Greek. If they had
known and recollected, that in the language of Lapland
there are, as we are told, thirteen Cases, they would have
hesitated to use an argument which would prove that
there must therefore be thirteen Cases in Greek and Latin

also |

All this confusion might have been avoided, if it

had but been observed that the word “Case” is used in
two senses.

CAUSE.—See “ REAson,” and “ WHY.”

CERTAIN.—This is a word whose ambiguity, toge
ther with that of many others of kindred signification (as
“may,” “can,” “must,” “possible,” &c.) has occasioned
infinite perplexity in discussions on some of the most im
portant subjects; such as the freedom of human actions,
the divine foreknowledge, &c.

In its primary sense, it is applied (according to its ety
mology, from cerno) to the state of a person's mind; de

noting any one's full and complete conviction; and, gene
rally, though not always, implying that there is sufficient
ground for such conviction. It was thence easily trans
ferred to the truths or events, respecting which this convic
tion is rationally entertained. And Uncertain (as well as

AMBIGUOUs TERMs.

277

the substantives and adverbs derived from these adjectives)
follows the same rule. Thus we say, “it is certain that a
battle has been fought:” “it is certain that the moon will
be full on such a day;” “it is uncertain whether such a
one is alive or dead:” “it is uncertain whether it will rain

to-morrow:” meaning, in these, and in all other cases, that
we are certain, or uncertain, respectively; not indicating
any difference in the character of the events themselves,
except in reference to our knowledge respecting them;

for the same thing may be, at the same time, both certain
and uncertain, to different individuals; e.g. the life or
death, at a particular time, of any one, is certain, to his
friends on the spot; uncertain or contingent, to those at a
distance. From not attending to this circumstance, the

words “uncertain” and “contingent” (which is employed
nearly in the same sense as uncertain in its secondary
meaning) have been considered by many writers* as de
noting some quality in the things themselves, and have thus
become involved in endless confusion. “Contingent” is
indeed applied to events only, not to persons; but it de
notes no quality in the events themselves ; only, as has
been said, the relation in which they stand to a person who
has no complete knowledge respecting them. It is from
overlooking this principle, obvious as it is when once dis
tinctly stated, that Chance or Fortune has come to be re
* Among others, Archbishop King, in his discourse on
Predestination, has fallen into this error; as is explained in the

Notes and the Appendix to my edition of that work.
It may be allowable to mention in this place, that I have been

mistake, which the author candidly acknowledged, and has pro

garded as a real agent, and to have been, by the ancients,

CHURCH is sometimes employed to signify the Church,
2. e. the Universal or Catholic Church,-the Society com
prehending in it all Christians, who are “Members one

of another,” and who compose the Body, of which Christ
is the Head.

Sometimes again it is employed to signify a

Church; i.e. any one branch of that general Society; in
which sense we read of the “Seven Churches in Asia;-of

St. Paul’s having “the care of all the Churches,” &c.

This ambiguity has often greatly favoured the cause of the
Church of Rome; which being admitted by her opponents

to be a Church, i. e. a branch, though an unsound and
corrupt one, of the Universal Church of Christ, is thence

assumed to be the Church,-the Society in which all men
are called upon to enrol themselves.—See the article
** TRUTH.”

BECAUSE.-See “REAso N,” and “ WHY.”

ELECTION.—This is one of the terms which is often
to all practical purposes ambiguous, when not employed,
strictly speaking, in two different senses, but with different
applications, according to that which is understood in con
junction with it.—See Ch. iii. § 10.

EXPERIENCE.—This word, in its strict sense, applies
to events which have taken place within a person's own

knowledge. Experience in this sense, of course, relates to
the past alone. Thus it is that a man knows by Experi
ence what sufferings he has undergone in some disease, or

what height the tide reached at a certain time and place.

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

279

More frequently the word is used to denote that Judg
ment which is derived from Experience in the primary
sense, by reasoning from that, in combination with other

data. Thus, a man may assert, on the ground of Expe
rience, that he was cured of a disorder by such a medi
cine—that that medicine is, generally, beneficial in that
disorder;-that the tide may always be expected, under
such circumstances, to rise to such a height. Strictly
speaking, none of these can be known by Experience, but
are conclusions derived from Experience. It is in this
sense only that Experience can be applied to the future, or,
which comes to the same thing, to any general fact ; as,
e.g. when it is said that we know by Experience that
water exposed to a certain temperature will freeze.
There are again two different applications of the word
(see Ch. iii. S. 10.), which, when not carefully distinguished,
lead in practice to the same confusion as the employment
of it in two senses: viz. we sometimes understand, ourown

personal Experience; sometimes, general Experience.
Hume has availed himself of this (practical) ambiguity, in
his Essay on Miracles; in which he observes, that we have

Experience of the frequent falsity of Testimony, but that
the occurrence of a Miracle is contrary to our Expe
rience, and is consequently what no testimony ought to
be allowed to establish. Now had he explained whose
Experience he meant, the argument would have come to
nothing: if he means, the Experience of mankind univer
sally, i. e. that a Miracle has never come under the Expe
rience of any one, this is palpably begging the question:
if he means the experience of each individual who has
never himself witnessed a Miracle, this would establish a

rule (viz. that we are to believe nothing of which we have
not ourselves experienced the like) which it would argue

insanity to act upon. Not only was the King of Bantam

280

APPENDIX.

justified (as Hume himself admits) in listening to no evi
dence for the existence of Ice, but no one would be autho

zized on this principle to expect his own death.

His Ex

perience informs him directly only that others have died.
Every disease under which he himself may have laboured,
his Experience must have told him has not terminated fa

tally; if he is to judge strictly of the future by the past,
according to this rule, what should hinder him from expect

ing the like of all future diseases? Probably he meant, if
indeed he had any distinct meaning, something intermediate
between these two ; viz. the Experience of the generality,
as to what is common and of ordinary occurrence; in which
sense the maxim will only amount to this, that false Tes
timony is a thing of common occurrence, and that Miracles
are not ; an obvious truth, no doubt; but too general to

authorize of itself a conclusion in any particular case. In
any other individual question, as to the admissibility of
evidence, it would be reckoned absurd to consider merely
the average chances for the truth of Testimony in the ab
stract, without inquiring what the Testimony is, in the par
ticular instance before us.

It is to be observed by the way, that there is yet an ad
ditional ambiguity in the entire phrase “contrary to ex
perience:” in one sense, a miracle, or any other event,
may be called contrary to the experience of any one who

has never witnessed the like; as the freezing of water was
1o that of the King of Bantam: in another and stricter sense,
that only is contrary to a man's experience, which he knows

by experience not to be true; asif one should be told of an
infallible remedy for some disorder, he having seen it ad

ministered without effect. No testimony can establish
what is, in this latter sense, contrary to experience. We

need not wonder that ordinary minds should be bewildered
by a sophistical employment of such a mass of ambiguities,

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

Such reasonings as these are accounted ingenious and
profound, on account of the Subject on which they are
employed; if applied to the ordinary affairs of life, they
would be deemed unworthy of serious notice.
FALSEHOOD and FALSITY..—See “TRUTH.”
GOSPEL.

This is instanced as one of the words which

is practically ambiguous, from its different applications,

even though not employed (as it sometimes is) in different
SenSeS.

Conformably to its etymological meaning of “Good
tidings,” it is used to signify (and that especially and exclu
sively) the welcome intelligence of Salvation to man, as

preached by our Lord and his followers. But it was
afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histo
ries of our Lord’s life, published by those who are called
the Evangelists. This is one source of some important
theological errors; many supposing that Gospel-truth is
to be found exclusively, or chiefly, in the Gospels; to the
neglect of the other Sacred Writings. Again, since Jesus
is said to have preached the “Gospel,” and the same is
said of the Apostles, the conclusion is often hence drawn,
that the discourses of our Lord and the Apostolic Epistles

must exactly coincide; and that in case of any apparent
difference, the former must be the standard, and the latter

must be taken to bear no other sense than what is implied
by the other; a notion which leads inevitably and imme

diately to the neglect of the Apostolic Epistles, when
everything they contain must be limited and modified into
a complete coincidence with our Lord’s Discourses.

Whereas it is very conceivable, that though both might be
in a certain sense “good-tidings,” yet, one may contain
a much more full developement of the Christian scheme

than the other; which is confirmed by the consideration,
that the principal events on which the Religion is founded
(the atoning sacrifice and resurrection of Christ )had not
taken place, nor could be clearly declared by our Lord
when He preached, saying, “the Kingdom of Heaven is
at hand;” not that it was actually established; as it was,
when his Apostles were sent forth to preach to all na
tions.

HENCE.-See “ REAso N” and “ WHY.”

IDENTICAL.-See “ SAME” and “ONE.”

IMPOSSIBILITY. According to the definition wenay
choose to give of this word, it may be said either that there
are three Species of it, or that it may be used in three dif
ferent senses. 1st. What may be called a mathematical
impossibility, is that which involves an absurdity and self
contradiction; e.g. that two straight lines should enclose a
space, is not only impossible but inconceivable, as it would
be at variance with the definition of a straight line. And

it should be observed, that inability to accomplish anything
which is, in this sense, impossible, implies no limitation of
power, and is compatible even with omnipotence, in the
fullest sense of the word. If it be proposed, e.g. to con
struct a triangle having one of its sides equal to the other
two, or to find two numbers having the same ratio to each
other as the side of a square and its diameter, it is not from
a defect of power that we are precluded from solving such

a problem as these; since in fact the problem is in itself
unmeaning and absurd.: it is, in reality, nothing, that is
required to be done.

2dly. What may be called a Physical Impossibility is
something at variance with the existing Laws of Nature,

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

283

and which consequently no Being, subject to those Laws,
(as we are) can surmount ; but we can easily conceive a

Being capable of bringing about what in the ordinary
course of Nature is impossible: e. g. to multiply five
loaves into food for a multitude, or to walk on the sur

face of the waves, are things physically impossible, but
imply no contradiction; on the contrary, we cannot but
suppose that the Being, if there be such an one, who
created the Universe, is able to alter at will the properties
of any of the Substances it contains.”
And an occurrence of this character we call miraculous.

Not but that one person may perform without supernatu
ral power what is, to another, physically impossible; as
e.g. a man may lift a great weight, which it would be
physically impossible for a child to raise; because it is
contrary to the Laws of Nature that a muscle of this de

gree of strength should overcome a resistance which one
of that degree is equal to. But if any one perform what
is beyond the natural powers of man universally, he has
performed a miracle. Much Sophistry has been founded
on the neglect of the distinction between these two senses.
It has even been contended, that no evidence ought to in
duce a man of sense to admit that a miracle has taken

place, on the ground that it is a thing impossible; in other
words, that it is a miracle; for if it were not a thing im

possible to man, there would be no miracle in the case:
so that such an argument is palpably begging the question;
but it has often probably been admitted from an indistinct
notion being suggested of Impossibility in the first sense ;
in which sense (viz. that of self-contradiction) no evidence
certainly would justify belief.
* See an able Disquisition on Miracles, subjoined to the Life
of Apollonius Tyanaeus, in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana.

284

APPENDIX.

3dly. Moral Impossibility signifies only that high degree
of improbability which leaves no room for doubt.

In

this sense we often call a thing impossible, which implies
no contradiction, nor violation of the Laws of Nature,
but which yet we are rationally convinced will never
occur, merely from the multitude of chances againstit; as
e.g. that unloaded dice should turn up the same faces one
hundred times successively. And in this sense we cannot
accurately draw the line, so as to determine at what point
the improbability amounts to an Impossibility; and hence
we often have occasion to speak of this or that as almost
impossible, though not quite, &c. The other Impossibili
ties do not admit of degrees. That a certain throw should
recur two or three times successively, we should call not
very improbable ; the improbability is increased at each
successive step; but we cannot say exactly when it be
comes impossible; though no one would scruple to call
one hundred such recurrences impossible.

In the same sense we often call things impossible which
are completely within the power of known agents to bring
about, but which we are convinced no one of them ever

will bring about. Thus, e.g. that all the civilized people
in the world should with one accord forsake their habita

tions and wander about the fields as savages, every one
would call an Impossibility, though it is plain they have
the power to do so, and that it depends on their choice
which they will do. In like manner, if we were told of a
man's having disgracefully fled from his post, whom we
knew to be possessed of the most undaunted courage, we
should without scruple (and with good reason, supposing
the idea formed of his character to be a just one) pro
nounce this an Impossibility; meaning, that there is suffi

cient ground for being fully convinced that the thing
could never take place ; not from any idea of his not

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

285

having power and liberty to fly, if he would; for our
certainty is built on the very circumstance of his being free
to act as he will, together with his being of such a dispo
sition as never to have the will to act disgracefully. If
again a man were bound hand and foot, it would be, in

the other sense, impossible for him to fly; viz. out of his
power. “Capable” has a corresponding ambiguity.
The performance of anything that is morally impossible
to a mere man, is to be reckoned a miracle, as much as if

the impossibility were physical. e. g. It is morally impos
sible for poor Jewish fishermen to have framed such a
scheme of ethical and religious doctrine as the Gospel
exhibits. It is morally impossible for a man to foretell
distant and improbable future events with the exactitude
of many of the prophecies in the Old Testament.

Much of the confusion of thought which has pervaded,
and has interminably protracted, the discussions respect

ing the long-agitated question of human freedom, has
arisen from inattention to the ambiguity which has been
here noticed. If the Deity, it is said, “foresees exactly
what I shall do on any occasion, it must be impossible for
me to act otherwise;” and thence it is inferred that man's

actions cannot be free. The middle term employed in
such an argument as this is “impossible,” or “impossibi

lity” employed in two senses: he to whom it is, in one
sense, impossible, (viz. physically) to act otherwise than
he does, i. e. who has it not in his power, is not a free

agent; correct foreknowledge implies impossibility in
another sense, viz. moral impossibility;-the absence of
all room for doubt. And the perplexity is aggravated by
resorting, for the purpose of explanation, to such words as

“may,” “can,” “possible,” “must,” &c., all of which
are affected by a corresponding ambiguity. (See Tucker's
“Light of Nature,” in the Chapters on Providence, on

Free-will, and some others.) I have endeavoured to con
dense and to simplify some of the most valuable parts of
his reasonings, in the notes and appendix to an edition of
Archbishop King's Discourse on Predestination.

l

LAW is etymologically, that which is “laid” down;
and is used, in the most appropriate sense, to signify some
general injunction, command, or regulation, addressed to
certain Persons, who are called upon to conform to it. It
is in this sense that we speak of “the Law of Moses,”
“ the Law of the Land,” &c.
It is also used in a transferred sense, to denote the state

ment of some general fact, the several individual instances
of which exhibit a conformity to that statement, analogous
to the conduct of persons in respect to a Law which they
obey. It is in this sense that we speak of “the Laws of
Nature:” when we say that “a seed in vegetating directs

the radicle downwards and the plumule upwards, in com
pliance with a Law of Nature,” we only mean that such
is universally the fact; and so, in other cases.
It is evident therefore that, in this sense, the conformity
of individual cases to the general rule is that which consti
tutes a Law of Nature.

If water should henceforth never

become solid, at any temperature, then the freezing of
water would no longer be a Law of Nature: whereas in
the other sense, a Law is not the more or the less a Law

from the conformity or non-conformity of individuals to
it: if an act of our legislature were to be disobeyed and
utterly disregarded by every one, it would not on that
account be the less a Law.

This distinction may appear so obvious when plainly
stated, as hardly to need mention: yet writers of great
note and ability have confounded these two senses toge

ther; I need only mention Hooker (in the opening of his

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

great work) and Montesquieu : the latter of whom de
claims on the much stricter observance in the Universe of

the Laws of Nature, than in mankind, of the divine and

human Laws laid down for their conduct: not considering
that, in the former case, it is the observance that consti
iutes the Law.

MAY, and likewise MUST, and CAN, (as well as

CANNOT) are each used in two senses, which are very
often confounded together. They relate sometimes to
Power, sometimes to Contingency. When we say of one

who has obtained a certain sum of money, “now he may
purchase the field he was wishing for,” we mean that it is
in his power: it is plain that he may, in the same sense,

hoard up the money, or spend it on something else; though
perhaps we are quite sure, from our knowledge of his
character and situation, that he will not.

When again

we say, “it may rain to-morrow,” or “the vessel may
have arrived in port,” the expression does not at all relate

to power, but merely to contingency; i. e. we mean, that
though we are not sure such an event will happen or has

happened, we are not sure of the reverse. When again
we say, “this man, of so grateful a disposition, must have
eagerly embraced such an opportunity of requiting his
benefactor,” or “one who approves of the slave trade
must be very hard-hearted,” we only mean to imply the
absence of all doubt on these points. The very notions of
gratitude and of hard-heartedness exclude the idea of com
pulsion. But when we say that “all men must die,” or

that “a man must go to prison who is dragged by force,”
we mean “whether they will or not”—that there is no
power to resist. So also if we say that a Being of perfect
goodness “cannot” act wrong, we do not mean that it is
out of his power, since that would imply no goodness of

288

character; but that there is good reason for feeling sure
that he will not: it is in a very different sense that we say
of a man fettered in a prison, that he “cannot” escape;

meaning, that though he has the will, he wants the
ability.
These words are commonly introduced, in questions
connected with Fatalism and the Freedom of human ac

tions, to explain the meaning of “necessary,” “impossi
ble,” &c.; and having themselves a corresponding ambi

guity, they only tend to increase the perplexity.
“— Chaos umpire sits

And by deciding worse embroils the fray.”
MUST.-See “ MAY.”

NECESSARY. This word is used as the contrary to

“impossible” in all its senses, and is of course liable to a
corresponding ambiguity. Thus it is “mathematically
Necessary” that two sides of a triangle should be greater
than the third : there is a “physical necessity” for the fall

of a stone; and a “moral necessity” that a Being of a
certain character should act, when left perfectly free, con
formably to that character; i. e. we are sure he will act

so; though of course it is in his power to act otherwise,
else there would be no moral agency. This ambiguity is
employed sophistically to justify immoral conduct; since
no one is responsible for anything done under “necessity,”
—i. e. physical necessity; as when a man is dragged any
where by external force, or falls down from being too
weak to stand : and then the same excuse is fallaciously
extended to “moral necessity” also.
There are likewise numberless different applications of
the word “necessary” (as well as of those derived from it)

in which there is a practical ambiguity, from the differ

ence of the things understood in conjunction with it: e.g.
food is “necessary;” viz.—to life: great wealth is “ne
cessary”—to the gratification of a man of luxurious ha

bits; the violation of moral duty is in many cases “neces
sary”—for the attainment of certain worldly objects; the
renunciation of such objects, and subjugation of the de
sires is “necessary”—to the attainment of the Gospel-pro
mises, &c. And thus it is that “necessity” has come to be

“the tyrant's plea;” for as no one is at all responsible for
what is a matter of physical necessity, what he has no
power to avoid—so, a degree of allowance is made for a
man's doing what he has power to avoid, when it appears
to be the least of two evils; as, e.g., when a man who is
famishing takes the first food he meets with, as “necessary”
to support life, or throws over goods in a storm, when it

is “necessary,” in order to save the ship. But if the plea
of necessity be admitted without inquiring for what the
act in question is necessary, anything whatever may be
thus vindicated ; since no one commits any crime which is
not, in his view, “necessary” to the attainment of some
supposed advantage or gratification.
I have treated more fully on this fruitful source of so

phistry in the Appendix (No. 1.) to King’s “Discourse on
Predestination.” In the course of it, I suggested an ety
mology of the word, which I have reason to think is not
correct ; but it should be observed, that this makes no

difference in the reasoning, which is not in any degree
founded on that etymology; nor have I, as some have re
presented, attempted to introduce any new or unusual
sense of the word, but have all along appealed to common

wse, the only right standard, and merely pointed out
the senses in which each word has actually been employed.

notes the length of time that any object has existed; and
many are not aware that they are accustomed to use it in
any other. It is, however, very frequently employed in
stead of “Ancient,” to denote distance of time. The

same transition seems to have taken place in Latin.
Horace says of Lucilius, who was one of the most ancient
Roman authors, but who did not live to be old,—
“quo fit ut omnis
Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella
Vita Senis.”

The present is a remarkable instance of the influence of an
ambiguous word over the thoughts even of those who are
not ignorant of the ambiguity, but are not carefully on

the watch against its effects ; the impressions and ideas
associated by habit with the word when used in one sense,
being always apt to obtrude themselves unawares, when it
is employed in another sense, and thus to affect our rea
sonings: e. g. Old times,—“the Old World,” &c. are ex
pressions in frequent use, and which, oftener than not,
produce imperceptibly the associated impression of the
superior wisdom resulting from experience, which, as a
general rule, we attribute to Old men. Yet no one is
really ignorant that the world is older now than ever it
was ; and that the instruction to be derived from observa

tions on the past (which is the advantage that Old persons
possess) must be greater, supposing other things equal, to
every successive generation; and Bacon's remark to this
purpose appears, as soon as distinctly stated, a mere
truism : yet few, perhaps, that he made are more import

ant. There is always a tendency to appeal with the same
kind of deference to the authority of “Old times,” as of
aged men.

It should be kept in mind, however, that ancient cus

that their effects may be estimated from long experience;
whereas we cannot be sure, respecting any recently-esta

time some effects which were not originally contemplated.

PERSON–In its ordinary use, always implies a dis
tinct Substance: each man is one Person, and can be but

one. It has, besides, a peculiar theological sense, more

closely connected with its etymology. It is well known
that the Latin word Persona signified, originally, a Mask
which actors wore on the stage; each of which being
painted in each instance suitably to the character to be
represented, and worn by every one who acted the part, the
word came to signify the character itself which the actor
played; and afterwards, any character, proper or as
sumed, which any one sustained; as e. g. in a passage of
Cicero (de Oratore), where he is describing the process by
which he composed his pleadings, by imagining himself in
the place of his opponent, and of the Judge, as well as his
own : “tres Personas unus suscipio, summa animi aequi

tate; mean, adversarii, judicis.” We should render this
by saying, “I assume these three characters,” or, “I
place myself in these three situations.” The further tran
sition, by which Persona, and, as anglicized by us, Person,

came to signify commonly a distinct Being, is very natu

ral; though I believe it never took place while the purity
of the Latin idiom lasted.

Persona, in its classical sense,

was naturally adopted by Theologians to distinguish the
Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit in the blessed Trinity,

so as to imply the unity of the Divine Being, who is all
and each of these; and the word Person was adopted by
our divines, in the same sense, as a literal, or rather an

etymological, translation of the Latin word Persona. In
this sense, its difference from Person, as commonly em
ployed, is most important; for it is evident that “three
divine Persons,” in the ordinary meaning of the word, is
precisely equivalent to “three Gods.” Our Church,
however, not only maintains and inculcates the strict Unity

of the Supreme Being, but retains a creed which expressly
declares the Son to be “ of one Substance with the Fa

ther ;” though she has been charged with teaching con

tradictions, while she teaches (what is surely not at all
unintelligible) that what is three in one sense, may in
another sense be one. Whether it were wisely done to
introduce at all the word Person in a sense different in a

most important particular from the ordinary one, yet so

nearly approaching to it as to be always likely to perplex
and mislead, it is now too late to inquire. But it is worth
remarking, that our Reformers appear to have introduced

it only from a desire to render faithfully what they trans
lated; seeming, in most instances, where they composed
anything original for the use of the people, carefully to

abstain from it: it does not occur in the Collect (though
it does in the Communion-Preface) for Trinity Sunday; nor
in the brief but satisfactory summary of the chief doc
trines of the Apostle's Creed, contained in the Catechism.

In this our Church, very wisely and scripturally, sets
before us the relations in which the Most High stands to
wards us, of Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; thus

adhering to the apparent design of Holy Writ, which
seems to be, to reveal to us, with a view to our prac
tical benefit, not what God is in Himself, but what He is

relatively to us. They were wise, therefore, in deciding,
as they appear to have done, that whatever other distinc

tions between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, do really
exist in the Divine Essence, but are neither relative to us,

nor connected with a Christian life, are, at least, not to be

dwelt on, at any rate till we have fully embraced, and
sufficiently applied, those many doctrines which are, in
some degree, both comprehensible by the understanding,
and practically useful to us. So far, however, have many
others been from imitating this wisdom, that I have even
seen a popular explanation (Mrs. Trimmer's) of the very
passage last alluded to in the Catechism, in which the
word Person is introduced, without even an allusion to

its being employed in a peculiar sense ! If it be vain to

explain the unknown by the unknown, how great must be
the absurdity of explaining what in fact was already made

as simple and intelligible as possible, by a word which
will not be merely not-understood, but misunderstood. It
is setting the blind to lead the seeing.
The consequences of this practice, which unfortunately
is very common, are more extensively mischievous than
most men are aware. To the undetected ambiguity of the
word Person may be traced a large portion of the Soci
nianism, Arianism, and Infidelity, that prevail. It is not
wonderful that the unthinking, when they have never
heard the explanation of the two senses of the word,
should be persuaded to renounce a faith which is repre
sented to them, for want of that explanation, as involving
a contradiction, or leading to Tritheism. And many who
-

do understand, or at least have once understood, the

ambiguity in question, are apt (and the same takes place

294

APPENDIX.

in numberless other instances) to sit down satisfied, that
they are in consequence safe from all danger in that quar
ter; not considering how much the thoughts are habitu

ally influenced, through the force of association, by the
recurrence of the ordinary sense of the word to those who
are not especially on their guard against it. (See Falla
cies, Ch. iii. §. 5.) And hence the frequent use of the
word Person, in its ordinary sense, causes them to slide in
sensibly into the unthought-of, but not uncommon, heresy
of Tritheism; from which they think themselves the more
secure, because they always maintain the Unity of the
Deity; though they gradually come to understand that
Unity in a merely figurative sense: viz., a Unity of pur
pose, and concert of action; just as any one commonly

says, “My friend such-an-one and myself are one;”
meaning that they pursue the same designs with entire
mutual confidence, and perfect co-operation, and have that
exact agreement in opinions, views, tastes, &c. which is
often denoted by the expression, “one mind.” (See re
marks on the word “SAME,” in this Appendix, and in the
Dissertation, Ch. v.) The error of Tritheism, thus intro

duced, is indeed one which cannot be regarded as trifling in
itself, if we consider that the maintenance of the doctrine of

the strict unity of God was no small part of the great pur

pose for which one nation was during so many ages separated
from all the rest of the world; but the collateral effects

resulting are far more important. I mean, not only that

many are by this means (as has been above remarked)
driven into perversion of Gospel-truth on the opposite side,
or a total rejection of it, but also that a far greater num

ber of well-intentioned Christians are led to the practical
neglect of a doctrine which is the corner-stone of our

Faith: they find their minds so perplexed and confused by
the ordinary statements of the doctrine of the Trinity, and

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

in so much danger ofsliding into Tritheism, that while they
humbly give their assent to it, they at the same time (I say
this in a great measure not from conjecture, but from
knowledge of the fact) deliberately, and as a point of con

science, study to keep the doctrine out of their thoughts;
though it ought to be the spring-head of those Christian
principles which are called into Christian practice every
day.
Too often do those who can and should clear up for
them these factitious difficulties, content themselves with

saying that the whole subject is mysterious, and must not
be too carefully pryed into: not considering the difference
between divine revelations and human expositions of them;
—between inquiries into the mysteries of the Divine nature,
and into the mysteries arising from the ambiguity of lan
guage; and that, too, language framed, as in the present
case, by uninspired men.
The same observations will apply to the word Per
sonality.
If it appear to any that this discussion has extended be
-

yond its proper limits, let it be remembered that the pre
sent is one of the most remarkable and most important
instances of the mischiefs resulting frominattention to the
ambiguity of terms.
POSSIBLE-This word, like the others of kindred

meaning, relates sometimes to contingency, sometimes to

power; and these two senses are frequently confounded.
In the first sense we say, e.g. “it is possible this patient
may recover,” not meaning, that it depends on his choice;
but that we are not sure whether the event will not be

such. In the other sense it is “possible” to the best man
to violate every rule of morality; since if it were out of
his power to act so if he chose it, there would be no moral

APPENDIX.

goodness in the case; though we are quite sure that such
never will be his choice.—See “IMPossIBLE.”

PRIEST.-See “DissERTATION,” Ch. iv. S. 2.

Etymologically, the word answers to Presbyter, i. e.
Elder of the Christian Church; and is often applied to the
second order of Christian Ministers at the present day.
But it is remarkable that it never occurs in this sense, in

our translation of the Scriptures ; the word ºpsočdispos
being always rendered by Elder; and its derivative, Priest,

always given as the translation of ‘Ipses. This latter is
an office assigned to none under the Gospel-scheme,

except the ONE great High Priest, of whom the Jewish
Priests were types, and who offered a Sacrifice (that
being the most

distinguishing

office of a Priest in the

sense of ‘Ispaws) which is the only one under the
Gospel.
It is incalculable how much confusion has arisen from

confounding together the two senses of the word Priest,
and thence, the two offices themselves.

I have enlarged accordingly on this subject in a Sermon,
preached before the University of Oxford, and subjoined
to the last edition of the Bampton Lectures.
REASON.—This word is liable to many ambiguities, of
which I propose to notice only a few of the most important.
Sometimes it is used to signify all the intellectual powers

collectively; in which sense it can hardly be said to be
altogether denied to brutes; since several of what we
reckon intellectual processes in the human mind, are evi

dently such as some brutes are capable of.
Reason is, however, frequently employed to denote those
intellectual powers exclusively in which man differs from
brutes; though what these are no one has been able pre

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

297

cisely to define. The employment at will of the faculty
of Abstraction seems to be the principal; that being, at
least, principally concerned in the use of Language. The
Moral faculty, or power of distinguishing right from
wrong, appears also to be closely connected with Abstrac
tion; and of this brutes are destitute; but then, Dr. Paley

and some other ethical writers deny it to man also. The
description given by that author of our discernment of
good and bad conduct, (viz. as wholly dependent on ex
pectation of reward and punishment) would equally apply

to many of the brute-creation, especially the Dog. It is
in this sense, however, that some writers speak of “Rea
son” as enabling us to judge of virtue and vice; not, as
Dr. Campbell in his Philosophy of Rhetoric has understood
them, in the sense of the power of argumentation. .
Reason, however, is often used for the faculty of carry

ing on the third operation of the mind; viz. Reasoning.
And it is from inattention to this ambiguity (which has
been repeatedly noticed in the course of the foregoing
treatise), that some have treated of Logic as the art of
rightly employing the mental faculties in general.
Reason is also employed to signify the Premiss or Pre
mises of an argument; and it is from Reason in this sense
that the word “Reasoning” is derived.
It is also very frequently used to signify a Cause: as
when we say, in popular language, that the “Reason of
an eclipse of the sun is, that the moon is interposed between
it and the earth.” This should strictly be called the cause.
On the other hand “Because” (i.e. by Cause) is used to in

troduce either the Physical Cause or the Logical Proof:
and “Therefore,” “Hence,” “Since,” “Follow,” “Conse
quence,” and many other kindred words, have a correspond

ing ambiguity: e.g. “the ground is wet, because it has
rained;” or “it has rained, and hence the ground is wet;”

298

APPENDIX.

this is the assignment of the Cause: again “it has rained, be
cause the ground is wet;” “the ground is wet, and therefore
it has rained;” this is assigning the logical proof: the wetness
of the ground is the cause, not of the rain having fallen,
but of our knowing that it has fallen. And this probably
it is that has led to the ambiguous use in all languages of
almost all the words relating to these two points. It is an

ambiguity which has produced incalculable confusion of
thought, and from which it is the harder to escape, on ac
count of its extending to those very forms of expression
which are introduced in order to clear it up.
What adds to the confusion is, that the Cause is often
employed as a Proof of the effect; as when we infer, from
a great fall of rain, that there is, or will be, a flood; which

is at once the physical effect, and the logical conclusion.
The case is just reversed, when from a flood we infer that
the rain has fallen.

The more attention any one bestows on this ambiguity,
the more extensive and important its results will appear.
—See Analytical Outline, S. 2.

REGENERATION.—This word is employed by some
Divines to signify the new life and character which ought
to distinguish a Christian; by others, more correctly, the
first entrance on or beginning of such a state; and these,

of course, are as different things as a full-grown branch
from a bud.

Much controversy has taken place as to the time at
which, and the circumstances under which “ Regenera

tion” takes place; the greater part of which may be traced
to this ambiguity.
SAME, (as well as “One,”“Identical,” and other words

derived from them) is used frequently in a sense very

299

different from its primary one, as applicable to a single
object; being employed to denote great similarity. When
several objects are undistinguishably alike, One single de
scription will apply equally to any of them; and thence

they are said to be all of one and the same nature, appear
ance, &c.; as e.g. when we say, “this house is built of the
same stone with such another,” we only mean that the
stones are undistinguishable in their qualities; not, that
the one building was pulled down, and the other con

structed with the materials. Whereas Sameness, in the
primary sense, does not even necessarily imply Similarity;
for if we say of any man that he is greatly altered since

such a time, we understand, and indeed imply by the very
expression, that he is One person, though different in
several qualities. It is worth observing also, that Same,
in the secondary sense, admits, according to popular
usage, of degrees: we speak of two things being nearly the
same, but not entirely: personal identity does not admit
of degrees. Nothing, perhaps, has contributed more to

the error of Realism than inattention to this ambiguity.
When several persons are said to have One and the Same

opinion, thought, or idea, men, overlooking the true
simple statement of the case, which is, that they are all
thinking alike, look for something more abstruse and mys
tical, and imagine there must be some One Thing, in the

primary sense, though not an individual, which is present
at once in the mind of each of these persons: and thence

readily sprung Plato's theory of Ideas, each of which was,
according to him, one real, eternal object, existing entire

and complete in each of the individual objects that are
known by one name. Hence, first in poetical mythology,
and ultimately, perhaps, in popular belief, Fortune,

Liberty, Prudence, (Minerva,) a Boundary, (Terminus,)
and even the Mildew of Corn, (Rubigo,) &c. became per

sonified, deified, and represented by Statues; somewhat
according to the process which is described by Swift, in
his humorous manner, in speaking of Zeal, (in the Tale of
a Tub,) “how from a notion it became a word, and from
thence, in a hot summer, ripened into a tangible Sub
stance.” We find Seneca thinking it necessary gravely to
combat the position of some his Stoical predecessors,
“that the Cardinal Virtues are Animals:” while the Hin

doos of the present day, from observing the similar symp
toms which are known by the name of Small-pox, and the
communication of the like from one patient to another, do
not merely call it (as we do) one disease, but believe (if
we may credit the accounts given) that the Small-pox is a
Goddess, who becomes incarnate in each infected patient.
All these absurdities are in fact but the extreme and ulti

mate point of Realism.—See Dissertation, Ch. v.
SIN, in its ordinary acceptation, means some actual
transgression, in thought, word, or deed, of the moral

law, or of a positive divine precept. It has also what may
be called a theological sense, in which it is used for Sinful
ness or Frailty,+a liability or proneness to transgression;
commonly called original Sin: in which sense we find in
the Psalms, “ in Sin hath my mother conceived me;” and

so also does our Church, in her office for infant-baptism,
speak of “remission of sins,” with reference to a child,
who is no moral agent; speaking also, within a few sen
tences, of our “following the innocency” of children; i.e.

innocence of actual Sin. There is no Theologian probably
who is not aware of this distinction; but much confusion of

thought has arisen from its not being always attended to.

AMBIGUOUs TERMs.

TRUTH, in the strict logical sense, applies to Proposi
tions, and to nothing else; and consists in the conformity of
the declaration made to the actual state of the case; agree
ably to Aldrich's definition of a “true” proposition—vera
est, quae quod res est dicit.
It would be an advantage if the word Trueness or
Verity could be introduced and employed in this sense,
since the word Truth is so often used to denote the “true”

Proposition itself. “What I tell you is the Truth; the
Truth of what I say shall be proved:” the term is here
used in these two senses.

In like manner Falsehood is

often opposed to Truth in both these senses; being com
monly used to signify the quality of a false proposition.
But as we have the word Falsity, which properly denotes
this, I have thought it best, in a scientific treatise, always
to employ it for that purpose.
In its etymological sense, Truth signifies that which the
speaker “trows,” or believes to be the fact. The etymo
logy of the word AAHOEX seems to be similar; denoting
non-concealment. In this sense it is opposed to a Lie ;
and may be called Moral, as the other may Logical, Truth.
A witness therefore may comply with his oath to speak
the Truth, though it so happen that he is mistaken in some
particular of his evidence, provided he is fully convinced
that the thing is as he states it.
Truth is not unfrequently applied, in loose and inaccu
rate language, to arguments; where the proper expres
sion would be “correctness,” “conclusiveness,” or “va

lidity.”
Truth again is often used in the sense of Reality.
People speak of the Truth or Falsity of facts; properly
speaking, they are either real or fictitious : it is the state
ment that is “true” or “false.” The “true” cause of any

thing, is a common expression; meaning “that which may

302

APPENDIX.

with Truth be assigned as the cause.” The senses of

Falsehood correspond.
This is an ambiguity of which the Romanists have often
availed themselves with great effect; the ambiguity of the
word Church (which see) lending its aid to the fallacy

“Even the Protestants,” they say, “dare not deny our's
to be a TRUE CHURCH: now there can be but ONE

TRUE CHURCH;” (which they support by those pas
sages of Scripture which relate to the collective body of
Christians in all those several branches which are also in

Scripture called Churches ;) “ours therefore must be
the true Church; if you forsake us you forsake the truth

and the Church, and consequently shut yourself out from
the promises of the Gospel.” Those who are of a logi
cal and accurate turn of mind, will easily perceive that the
sense in which the Romish Church is admitted by her
opponents to be a true Church, is that of reality;-it is

a real, not a pretended Church;—it may be truly said to
be a Church.

The sense in which the Romanists seize the

concession is, that of a Church teaching true doctrines;

which was never conceded to the Church of Rome by the
Protestants, who hold, that a Church may err without

ceasing to be a Church.

See “WHY” and “REAson.”

WHY? As an interrogative, this word is employed in

AMBIGUOUS TERMS

N. B. As the words which follow are all of them con

nected together in their significations, and as the explana
tions of their ambiguities have been furnished by the
kindness of the Professor of Political Economy, it seemed
advisable to place them by themselves, and in the order
in which they appeared to him most naturally to arrange
themselves.

The foundations of Political Economy being a few gene
ral propositions deduced from observation or from con
sciousness, and generally admitted as soon as stated, it
might have been expected that there would be as little
difference of opinion among Political-economists as among
Mathematicians;—that, being agreed in their premises,
they could not differ in their conclusions, but through some
error in reasoning, so palpable as to be readily detected.
And if they had possessed a vocabulary of general terms

as precisely defined as the mathematical, this would proba
bly have been the case.

But as the terms of this Science

are drawn from common discourse, and seldom care

fully defined by the writers who employ them, hardly one
of them has any settled and invariable meaning, and
their ambiguities are perpetually overlooked. The prin
cipal terms are only seven: viz. VALUE, WEALTH, LA
Bour, CAPITAL, ReNT, WAGES, PR of Its.
1. WALUE. As value is the only relation with which
Political Economy is conversant, we might expect all
Economists to be agreed as to its meaning. There is no
subject as to which they are less agreed.

The popular, and far the most convenient, use of the
word, is to signify the capacity of being given and received
in exchange. So defined, it expresses a relation. The

value of any one thing must consist in the several quanti

304

APPENDIX.

ties of all other things which can be obtained in exchange
for it, and can never remain fixed for an instant.

Most

writers admit the propriety of this definition at the outset,
but they scarcely ever adhere to it.
Adam Smith defines Value to mean either the utility of
a particular object, or the power of purchasing other
goods which the possession of that object conveys. The
first he calls “Value in use,” the second “Value in ex
change.” But he soon afterwards says, that equal quanti
ties of labour at all times and places are of equal Value to
the labourer, whatever may be the quantity of goods he
receives in return for them; and that labour never varies

in its own Value. It is clear that he affixed, or thought he
had affixed, some other meaning to the word, as the first
of these propositions is contradictory, and the second false,
whichever of his two definitions we adopt.
Mr. Ricardo appears to set out by admitting Adam
Smith's definition of Value in exchange. But in the
greater part of his “Principles of Political Economy,”

he uses the word as synonymous with Cost; and by this
one ambiguity has rendered his great work a long enigma.
Mr. Malthus” defines Value to be the power of purcha
sing. In the very next page he distinguishes absolute
from relative Value, a distinction contradictory to his
definition of the term, as expressive of a relation.
Mr. M'Culloch'ſ distinguishes between real and ex
changeable, or relative, Value. And in his nomenclature,
the exchangeable, or relative, value of a commodity con
sists in its capacity of purchasing;-its real Value, in the
quantity of labour required for its production or appro
priation.

305

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

All these differences appear to arise from a confusion of
cause and effect. Having decided that commodities are
Valuable in proportion to the labour they have respectively
cost, it was natural to call that labour their Value.

2. WEALTH. Lord Lauderdale has defined Wealth
to be “all that man desires.”

Mr. Malthus * “ those

material objects which are necessary, useful, or agreeable.”
Adam Smith confines the term to that portion of the re
sults of land and labour which is capable of being accu
mulated. The French Economists, to the net product of
land. Mr. M'Cullochi and M. Storch : to those mate

rial products which have exchangeable value; according
to Colonel Torrens; it consists of articles which possess

utility and are produced by some portion of voluntary
effort. M. Say | divides wealth into natural and social,
and applies the latter term to whatever is susceptible of
exchange. It will be observed that the principal difference
between these definitions consists in the admission or

rejection of the qualifications “exchangeable and material.”

It were well if the ambiguities of this word had done
no more than puzzle philosophers.

One of them gave

birth to the mercantile system. In common language, to
grow rich is to get money, to diminish in fortune is to lose
noney: a rich man is said to have a great deal of money;
a poor man, very little: and the terms Wealth and money

are in short employed as synonymous. In consequence

APPENDIX.

of these popular notions (to use the words of Adam Smith)
all the different nations of Europe have studied every
means of accumulating gold and silver in their respective
countries. This they have attempted by prohibiting the
exportation of money, and by giving bounties on the ex
portation, and imposing restrictions on the importation, of
other commodities, in the hope of producing what has
been called a “favourable balance of trade;” that is, a

trade in which, the imports being always of less value than
the exports, the difference is paid in money. A conduct
as wise as that of a tradesman who should part with his
goods only for money, and instead of employing their price

in paying his workmen's wages, or replacing his stock,
should keep it for ever in his till.

The attempt to force

such a trade has been as vain, as the trade, if it could have
been obtained, would have been mischievous. Bnt the re

sults have been fraud, punishment, and poverty at home,
and discord and war without.

It has made nations con

sider the Wealth of their customers a source of loss in

stead of profit, and an advantageous market a curse in

stead of a blessing; by inducing them to refuse to profit
by the peculiar advantages in climate, soil, or industry,
possessed by their neighbours, it has forced them in a
great measure to give up their own. It has for centuries
done more, and perhaps for centuries to come will do
more, to retard the improvement of Europe than all other
causes put together.

3. LABOUR. The word Labour signifies both the act
of labouring, and the result of that act.

It is used in the

first sense when we talk of the wages of labour; in the
second when we talk of accumulated Labour.

When used

to express the act of labouring it may appear to have a

precise sense, but it is still subject to some ambiguity.

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

307

Say's definition* is “action suivie, dirigée vers unbüt.”
Storch'st “ l'action des facultés humaines dirigée vers un
büt utile.”

These definitions include a walk taken for the

purposes of health, and even the exertions of an agreeable
converser.

The great defect of Adam Smith, and of our own eco

nomists in general, is the want of definitions. There is,
perhaps, no definition of Labour by any British Econo
mist. If Adam Smith had framed one, he would probably
have struck out his celebrated distinction between “pro
ductive” and “unproductive” labourers; for it is difficult

to conceive any definition of Labour which will admit the
epithet “unproductive” to be applied to any of its sub
divisions, excepting that of misdirected labour. On the
other hand, if Mr. M'Culloch or Mr. Mill had defined

Labour, they would scarcely have applied that term to the
growth of a tree, or the improvement of wine in a cellar.
4. CAPITAL. This word, as might have been expected,
from the complexity of the notions which it implies, has
been used in very different senses.
It is, as usual, undefined by Adam Smith. The general
meaning which he attached to it will however appear from

his enumeration of its species. He divides itſ into Fired
and Circulating: including in the first what the capitalist
retains, in the second what he parts with. Fixed Capital
he subdivides into—1. Machinery; 2. Shops and other
buildings used for trade or manufacture; 3. Improve

ments of land; 4. Knowledge and skill. Circulating Ca
pital he subdivides into 1. Money; 2. Provisions in the

manufacture; 4. Finished work in the hands of the mer
chant or manufacturer, such as furniture in a cabinet-ma

ker's shop, or trinkets in that of a jeweller. The follow

eminent subsequent economists.

ply of our wants, but to aid us in obtaining other articles
of utility.”
It is obvious that few of these definitions exactly coin
-

cide.

Adam Smith's excludes the necessaries of the

labourer, when in his own possession; all the rest (and
perhaps with better reason) admit them. On the other
hand, Adam Smith admits (and in that he seems to be
right) those things which are incapable of productive con
sumption, provided they have not yet reached their con
sumers. All the other definitions, except perhaps that of

Mr. Malthus which is ambiguous, are subject to the incon
sistency of affirming that a diamond, and the gold in which
it is to be set, are Capital while the jeweller keeps them se

parate, but cease to be so when he has formed them into a
ring: almost all of them, also, pointedly exclude knowledge
and skill. The most objectionable, perhaps, is that of
Mr. M'Culloch, which, while it excludes all the finished

contents of a jeweller's shop, would include a racing
stud.

Adam Smith, however, is far from being consistent in
his use of the word: thus, in the beginning of his second

book he states, that all Capitals are destined for the main
tenance of productive labour only. It is difficult to see

what labour is maintained by what is to be unproductively
consumed.

Adam Smith first divided revenue into Rent, Wages,

AMBIGUOUS TERMS,

313

The first observation to be made on these definitions, is,

that the Rent of land, which is only a species of an exten
sive genus, is used as a genus, and that its cognate species
are either omitted, or included under genera to which

they do not properly belong. Wages and Profits are of
human creation: they imply a sacrifice of ease or imme
diate enjoyment, and bear a ratio to that sacrifice which is
indicated by the common expressions of “the rate of
wages,” and “ the rate of profits:” a ratio which has a
strong tendency to uniformity. But there is another and

a very large source of revenue which is not the creation of
man, but of nature; which owes its origin, not to the will
of its possessor, but to accident; which implies no sacri
fice, has no tendency to uniformity, and to which the term
“rate” is seldom applied. This revenue arises from the
exclusive right to some instrument of production, enabling

the employment of a given amount of labour or capital to
be more than usually productive. The principal of these
instruments is land; but all extraordinary powers of body
or mind,-all processes in manufacture which are pro

tected by secrecy or by law,-all peculiar advantages
from situation or connexion,-in short, every instrument
of production which is not universally accessible, affords a
revenue distinct in its origin from Wages or Profits, and

of which the Rent of land is only a species. In the clas
sification of revenues, either Rent ought to have been

omitted as a genus, and considered only as an anomalous
interruption of the general uniformity of wages and pro
fits, or all the accidental sources of revenue ought to have
been included in one genus, of which the Rent of land

would have formed the principal species. Another remark
is, that almost all these definitions of Profit include the

wages of the labour of the Capitalist. The continental

Economists have in general been aware of this, and have

314

APPENDIX.

pointed it out in their analyses of the component parts of
Profit.

The British Economists have seldom entered into

this analysis, and the want of it has been a great cause of
obscurity.

On the other hand, much of what properly belongs to
Profit and Rent is generally included under Wages. Al
most all Economists consider the members of the liberal

professions under the class of labourers. The whole sub
sistence of such persons, observes Mr. M'Culloch,” is de

rived from Wages; and they are as evidently labourers
as if they handled the spade or the plough. But it should

be considered, that those who are engaged in any occupa
tion requiring more skill than that of a common husband
man, must have expended capital, more or less, on the
acquisition of their skill: their education must have cost

something, in every case, from that of the handicraft
apprentice, to that of the legal, or medical student; and
a Profit on this outlay is of course looked for, as in other
disbursements of capital; and the higher profit, in propor
tion to the risk; viz. the uncertainty of a man's success in
his business. Part, therefore, and generally far the
greater part, of what has been reckoned the wages of his
labour, ought more properly to be reckoned profits on the

capital expended in fitting him for that particular kind of
labour. And all the excess of gains acquired by one pos

sessing extraordinary talents, opportunities, or patronage
(since these correspond to the possession of land,-of a
patent-right, or other monopoly,–of a secret, &c.) may
be more properly regarded as Rent than as Wages.

Another most fruitful source of ambiguity arises from
the use of the word Wages sometimes as expressing a

quantity, sometimes as expressing a proportion.
* “Principles,” &c., p. 228.

AMBIGUOUS TERMS.

315

In ordinary language, Wages means the amount of some
commodity, generally of silver, given to the labourer in
return for a given exertion; and they rise or fall, as that
amount is increased or diminished.

In the language of Mr. Ricardo, they usually mean the
labourer's proportion of what is produced, supposing that.
produce to be divided between him and the Capitalist. In
this sense they generally rise as the whole produce is dimi

nished; though, if the word be used in the other sense,
they generally fall. If Mr. Ricardo had constantly used
the word “Wages” to express a proportion, the only incon
venience would be the necessity of always translating this
expression into common language. But he is not con

sistent. When he says,” that “whatever raises the Wages
of labour lowers the Profits of stock,” he considers Wages
as a proportion. When he says,t that “high Wages en
courage population;” he considers wages as an amount.
Even Mr. M'Culloch, who has clearly explained the

ambiguity, has not escaped it. He has even suffered it to
affect his reasonings. In his valuable essay, “On the
Rate of Wages,”f he admits that “when Wages are

high the Capitalist has to pay a larger share of the pro
duce of industry to his labourers.” An admission utterly
inconsistent with his general use of the word, as express
ing the amount of what the labourer receives, which, as he
has himself observed, § may increase while his proportion
diminishes.

A few only have been noticed of the ambiguities which
attach to the seven terms that have been selected ; and

these terms have been fixed on, not as the most ambiguous,

but as the most important, in the political nomenclature.

the most remarkable terms in several different branches of

knowledge, in order to show both the frequency of an

N. B. In such of the following examples as are not in a
syllogistic form, it is intended that the student should
practise the reduction of them into that form; those of

them, that is, in which the reasoning is in itself sound:
viz. where it is impossible to admit the Premises and
deny the Conclusion. Of such as are apparent syllo
gisms, the validity must be tried by logical rules, which

it may be advisable to apply in the following order: 1st.
Observe whether the argument be Categorical or Hy

pothetical ; recollecting that an hypothetical Premiss
does not necessarily imply an hypothetical Syllogism,
unless the reasoning turns on the hypothesis.

If this

appear to be the case, the rules for hypothetical Syllo
gisms must be applied. 2dly. If the argument be cate
gorical, count the terms. 3dly. If only three, observe

whether the Middle be distributed. 4thly. Observe
whether the Premises are both negative; (i.e. really,

and not in appearance only,) and if one is, whether the
Conclusion be negative also ; or affirmative, if both
Premises affirmative. 5thly. Observe what terms are
distributed in the Conclusion, and whether the same are

distributed in the Premises. 6thly. If the Syllogism is
not a Categorical in the first Figure, reduce it to that
form.

7. If all testimony to miracles is to be admitted, the

are not to be believed: therefore no testimony to miracles
is to be admitted.

8. If men are not likely to be influenced in the perform

ance of a known duty by taking an oath to perform it, the
oaths commonly administered are superfluous: if they are
likely to be so influenced, every one should be made to
take an oath to behave rightly throughout his life; but one
or the other of these must be the case: therefore either the

oaths commonly administered are superfluous, or every

man should be made to take an oath to behave rightly
throughout his life.

truth; and the Church of England is conformable to the

much attention.

14. We are bound to set apart one day in seven for re

us: but we are bound to set apart one day in seven for

religious duties; and hence it appears that the fourth

15. Abstinence from the eating of blood had reference

to the divine institution of sacrifices: one of the precepts

delivered to Noah was abstinence from the eating of blood:
therefore one of the precepts delivered to Noah was the

of ceremonial sin (which could not then exist), but of moral
sin: if so, the Levitical sacrifices must have had no less

efficacy; and in that case, the atonements under the Mosaic
law would have “made the comers thereunto perfect as
pertaining to the conscience;” but this was not the case:
therefore, &c. [Davison on Prophecy.]

17. The adoration of images is forbidden to Christians,
if we suppose the Mosaic law designed not for the Israel

ites alone, but for all men: it was designed, however, for
the Israelites alone, and not for all men: therefore the ado

ration of images is not forbidden to Christians.
18. A desire to gain by another's loss is a violation of
the tenth commandment: all gaming, therefore, since it
implies a desire to profit at the expense of another, involves
a breach of the tenth commandment.
19. All the fish that the net enclosed were an indiscri

minate mixture of various kinds: those that were set aside
and saved as valuable, were fish that the net enclosed:
therefore those that were set aside, and saved as valuable,
were an indiscriminate mixture of various kinds.

20. All the elect are finally saved: such persons as are

arbitrarily appointed out of mankind by the divine decree
are the elect: therefore such persons as are arbitrarily ap

pointed out of mankind by the divine decree are finally
saved. [The opponents of this Conclusion generally deny the Minor
Premiss and admit the Major : the reverse would be the more sound and
the more effectual objection.

21. No one who lives with another on terms of confi

dence is justified, on any pretence, in killing him: Brutus
lived on terms of confidence with Caesar: therefore he

was not justified, on the pretence he pleaded, in killing
him.

22. He that destroys a man who usurps despotic power
in a free country deserves well of his countrymen: Brutus
destroyed Caesar, who usurped despotic power in Rome:
therefore he deserved well of the Romans.

24. A wise lawgiver must either recognise the rewards
and punishments of a future state, or must be able to
appeal to an extraordinary Providence, dispensing them
regularly in this life: Moses did not do the former: there
fore he must have done the latter.

25. Nothing which is of less frequent occurrence than
the falsity of testimony can be fairly established by testi
mony: any extraordinary and unusual fact is a thing of
less frequent occurrence than the falsity of testimony.

(that being very common): therefore no extraordinary and
unusual fact can be fairly established by testimony.

26. Testimony is a kind of evidence which is very likely
to be false: the evidence on which most men believe that

there are pyramids in Egypt is testimony: therefore the

evidence on which most men believe that there are pyra
mids in Egypt is very likely to be false.
27. The religion of the ancient Greeks and Romans was
a tissue of extravagant fables and groundless superstitions,

credited by the vulgar and the weak, and maintained by
the more enlightened, from selfish or political views: the

same was clearly the case with the religion of the Egyp
tians: the same may be said of the Brahminical worship of
India, and the religion of Fo, professed by the Chinese:
the same, of the romantic mythological system of the Peru
vians, of the stern and bloody rites of the Mexicans, and

those of the Britons, and of the Saxons: hence we may
conclude that all systems of religion, however varied in
circumstances, agree in being superstitions kept up among
the vulgar, from interested or political views in the more
enlightened classes. [See Dissertation, cap. i. §. 2. p. 212.]

28. No man can possess power to perform impossibili

ties: a miracle is an impossibility: therefore no man can
possess power to perform a miracle. [See Appendix, p.288.]
29. A. B. and C. D. are each of them equal to E. F. :

therefore they are equal to each other.
30. Protection from punishment is plainly due to the
innocent : therefore, as you maintain that this person
ought not to be punished, it appears that you are con
vinced of his innocence.

31. All the most bitter persecutions have been religious
persecutions: among the most bitter persecutions were
those which occurred in France during the revolution:
therefore they must have been religious persecutions.

32. He who cannot possibly act otherwise than he
does, has neither merit nor demerit in his action: a

liberal and benevolent man cannot possibly act other
wise than he does in relieving the poor: therefore such
a man has neither merit nor demerit in his action.
[See Appendix, pp. 284–5.

33. What happens every day is not improbable: some
things against which the chances are many thousands to

one, happen every day: therefore some things against which
the chances are many thousands to one, are not impro
bable.

34. The early and general assignment of the Epistle to
the Hebrews to St. Paul as its author, must have been

either from its professing to be his, and containing his
name, or from its really being his ; since, therefore, the
former of these is not the fact, the Epistle must be St.
Paul's.

35. “With some of them God was not well pleased: for
they were overthrown in the wilderness.”

36. A sensualist wishes to enjoy perpetual gratifications
without satiety: it is impossible to enjoy perpetual grati

EXAMPLES

323

fications without satiety: therefore it is impossible for a
sensualist to obtain his wish.

37. If Paley's system is to be received, one who has no
knowledge of a future state has no means of distinguishing
virtue and vice: now one who has no means of distinguish

ing virtue and vice can commit no sin: therefore if Paley's
system is to be received, one who has no knowledge of a
future state can commit no sin.

38. The principles of justice are variable: the appoint
ments of nature are invariable: therefore the principles of
justice are no appointment of nature. [Arist. Eth. B. v.]
39. Every one desires happiness: virtue is happiness:
therefore every one desires virtue. [Arist. Eth. B. iii.)

40. A story is not to be believed, the reporters of which
give contradictory accounts of it: the story of the life and
exploits of Buonaparte is of this description: therefore it
is not to be believed. [Pide Elements, p. 28.]

41. When the observance of the first day of the week as
a religious festival in commemoration of Christs’ resurrec

tion, was first introduced, it must have been a novelty:
when it was a novelty, it must have attracted notice: when
it attracted notice, it would lead to inquiry respecting the

truth of the resurrection: when it led to this inquiry, it
must have exposed the story as an imposture, supposing it
not attested by living witnesses: therefore, when the ob
servance of the first day of the week, &c. was first intro

duced, it must have exposed as an imposture the story of

the resurrection, supposing it not attested by living wit
IleSSes.

42. All the miracles of Jesus would fill more books than

the world could contain: the things related by the Evan
gelists are the miracles of Jesus: therefore the things re
lated by the Evangelists would fill more books than the
world could contain.
Y2

APPENDIX.

43. If the prophecies of the Old Testament had been
written without knowledge of the events of the time of
Christ, they could not correspond with them exactly; and

if they had been forged by Christians, they would not be
preserved and acknowledged by the Jews: they are pre
served and acknowledged by the Jews, and they corre
spond exactly with the events of the time of Christ: there
fore they were neither written without knowledge of those
events, nor were forged by Christians.
44. Of two evils the less is to be preferred: occasional

turbulence, therefore, being a less evil than rigid despo
tism, is to be preferred to it.

45. According to theologians, a man must possess faith
in order to be acceptable to the Deity: now he who be
lieves all the fables of the Hindoo mythology must possess
faith: therefore such an one must, according to theologians,
be acceptable to the Deity.
46. If Abraham were justified, it must have been either

by faith or by works: now he was not justified by faith,
(according to St. James,) nor by works (according to St.
Paul): therefore Abraham was not justified.
47. No evil should be allowed that good may come of
it: all punishment is an evil: therefore no punishment
should be allowed that good may come of it.

48. Repentance is a good thing: wicked men abound in
repentance [Arist. Eth. B. ix.): therefore wicked men abound
in what is good.
49. A person infected with the plague will (probably)
die [suppose three in five of the infected die] : this man is

(pro

bably) infected with the plague [suppose it an even chance]:
therefore he will (probably) die. [Query. What is the amount of
this probability ?]

50. It must be admitted, indeed, that a man who has

been accustomed to enjoy liberty cannot be happy in the

EXAMPLES.

325

condition of a slave: many of the negroes, however, may
be happy in the condition of slaves, because they have
never been accustomed to enjoy liberty.

51. Whatever is dictated by Nature is allowable: de
votedness to the pursuit of pleasure in youth, and to that
ofgain in old age, are dictated by Nature [Arist. Rhet. B. ii.]:

therefore they are allowable.
52. He is the greatest lover of any one who seeks that
person's greatest good: a virtuous man seeks the greatest
good for himself: therefore a virtuous nian is the greatest
lover of himself.

[Arist. Eth. B. ix.]

53. He who has a confirmed habit of any kind of ac
tion, exercises no self-denial in the practice of that action:
a good man has a confirmed habit of Virtue: therefore he
who exercises self-denial in the practice of Virtue is not a
good man. [Arist. Eth. B. ii.]
54. That man is independent of the caprices of Fortune
who places his chief happiness in moral and intellectual
excellence : a true philosopher is independent of the ca
prices of Fortune: therefore a true philosopher is one who

places his chief happiness in moral and intellectual excel
lence.

55. A system of government which extends to those ac
tions that are performed secretly, must be one which refers
either to a regular divine providence in this life, or to the
rewards and punishments of another world: every perfect
system of government must extend to those actions which
are performed secretly ; no system of government there
fore can be perfect, which does not refer either to a regu
lar divine providence in this life, or to the rewards and
punishments of another world. [Warburton's Divine Legation.]
56. For those who are bent on cultivating their minds

by diligent study, the incitement of academical honours is
unnecessary; and it is ineffectual, for the idle, and such as

326

APPENDIX.

are indifferent to mental improvement: therefore the in
citement of academical honours is either unnecessary or
ineffectual.

57. He who is properly to be called an actor, does not
endeavour to make his hearers believe that the sentiments

he expresses, and the feelings he exhibits, are really his
own : a barrister does this: therefore he is not properly
to be called an actor.

58. He who bears arms at the command of the magi
strate does what is lawful for a Christian: the Swiss in the

French service, and the British in the American service,

bore arms at the command of the magistrate; therefore
they did what was lawful for a Christian.
59. If Lord Bacon is right, it is improper to stock a
new Colony with the refuse of Jails: but this we must

allow not to be improper, if our method of colonizing
New South Wales be a wise one: if this be wise, therefore,

Lord Bacon is not right.
60. Logic is indeed worthy of being cultivated, if Ari
stotle is to be regarded as infallible: but he is not : Logic
therefore is not worthy of being cultivated.
61. All studies are useful which tend to advance a man

in life, or to increase national and private wealth: but
the course of studies pursued at Oxford has no such ten
dency: therefore it is not useful.

62. If the exhibition of criminals, publicly executed,
tends to heighten in others the dread of undergoing the
same fate, it may be expected that those soldiers who have
seen the most service, should have the most dread of
death in battle: but the reverse of this is the case: there
fore the former is not to be believed.

63. If the everlasting favour of God is not bestowed at
random, and on no principle at all, it must be bestowed

either with respect to men's persons, or with respect to

327

EXAMPLES,

their conduct: but “God is no respecter of persons:”
therefore his favour must be bestowed with respect to men's
conduct. [Sumner's Apostolical Preaching.]

64. If transportation is not felt as a severe punishment,
it is in itself ill-suited to the prevention of crime: if it is
so felt, much of its severity is wasted, from its taking
place at too great a distance to affect the feelings, or even
come to the knowledge, of most of those whom it is de
signed to deter; but one or other of these must be the case:
therefore transportation is not calculated to answer the
purpose of preventing crime.

65. War is productive of evil: therefore peace is likely
to be productive of good.

66. Some objects of great beauty answer no other per
ceptible purpose but to gratify the sight: many flowers

have great beauty; and many of them accordingly answer
no other purpose but to gratify the sight.
67. A man who deliberately devotes himself to a life of
sensuality is deserving of strong reprobation : but those
do not deliberately devote themselves to a life of sensu

ality who are hurried into excess by the impulse of the
passions: such therefore as are hurried into excess by the
impulse of the passions are not deserving of strong repro
bation. [Arist. Eth. B. vii.]
68. It is a difficult task to restrain all inordinate desires:

to conform to the precepts of Scripture implies a restraint
of all inordinate desires: therefore it is a difficult task to

conform to the precepts of Scripture.

69. Any one who is candid will refrain from condemn
ing a book without reading it: some Reviewers do not
refrain from this: therefore some Reviewers are not can
did,

-

70. If any objection that can be urged would justify a

328

APPENDIX.

change of established laws, no laws could reasonably be
maintained: but some laws can reasonably be maintained:
therefore no objection that can be urged will justify a
change of established laws.
71. If any complete theory could be framed, to explain

the establishment of Christianity by human causes, such a
theory would have been proposed before now ; but
none such ever has been proposed: therefore no such
theory can be framed.
72. He who is content with what he has, is truly rich:

a covetous man is not content with what he has: no cove
tous man therefore is truly rich.
73. A true prophecy coincides precisely with all the cir

cumstances of such an event as could not be conjectured by
natural reason: this is the case with the prophecies of the
Messiah contained in the Old Testament: therefore these

are true prophecies.
74. The connexion of soul and body cannot be compre
hended or explained; but it must be believed: therefore
something must be believed which cannot be comprehended
or explained.
-

75. Lias lies above Red Sandstone; Red Sandstone lies
above Coal: therefore Lias lies above Coal.

76. Cloven feet belonging universally to horned animals,
we may conclude that this fossil animal, since it appears
to have had cloven feet, was horned.

77. All that glitters is not gold: tinsel glitters: there
fore it is not gold.
78. A negro is a man: therefore he who murders a
negro murders a man.
79. Meat and Drink are necessaries of life: the reve

nues of. Vitellius were spent on Meat and Drink: there

fore the revenues of Vitellius were spent on the necessaries
of life.

EXAMPLES.

329

80. Nothing is heavier than Platina: feathers are
heavier than Nothing : therefore feathers are heavier than
Platina.

81. The child of Themistocles governed his mother; she

governed her husband: he governed Athens; Athens,
Greece; and Greece, the world: therefore the child of

Themistocles governed the world.
82. He who calls you a man speaks truly: he who calls

you a fool, calls you a man: therefore he who calls you a
fool speaks truly.

83. Warm countries alone produce wines: Spain is a
warm country: therefore Spain produces wines.
84. It is an intensely cold climate that is sufficient to
freeze Quicksilver: the climate of Siberia is sufficient to
freeze Quicksilver: therefore the climate of Siberia is

intensely cold.
85. Mistleto of the oak is a vegetable excrescence which

is not a plant; and every vegetable excrescence which is
not a plant, is possessed of magical virtues: therefore Mis
tleto of the oak is possessed of magical virtues.
86. If the hour-hand of a clock be any distance (sup

pose a foot) before the minute-hand, this last, though mov
ing 12 times faster, can never overtake the other; for
while the minute-hand is moving over those 12 inches, the

hour-hand will have moved over one inch; so that they
will then be an inch apart; and while the minute-hand is
moving over that one inch, the hour-hand will have moved
over Princh, so that it will still be a-head; and again,
while the minute-hand is passing over that space of ºr
inch, which now divides them, the hour-hand will pass
over ++r inch; so that it will still be a-head, though the
distance between the two is diminished, &c. &c. &c., and

thus it is plain we may go on for ever: therefore the mi

330

APPENDIX.

nute-hand can never overtake the hour-hand. [This is one of
the sophistical puzzles noticed by Aldrich (the moving bodies being Achilles
and a Tortoise); but he is not happy in his attempt at a solution. He
proposes to remove the difficulty by demonstrating that, in a certain given
time, Achilles would overtake the Tortoise; as if any one had ever doubted
that. The very problem proposed is to surmount the difficulty of a seem

ing demonstration of a thing palpably impossible: to show that it is pal
pably impossible, is no solution of the problem.
I have heard the present example adduced as a proof that the preten
sions of Logic are futile, since (it was said) the most perfect logical de
monstration may lead from true premises to an absurd conclusion. The
reverse is the truth: the example before us furnishes a confirmation of
the utility of an acquaintance with the syllogistic form ; in which form the
pretended demonstration in question cannot possibly be erhibited. An at

tempt to do so will evince the utter want of connexion between the pre
mises and the conclusion.]

87. Theft is a crime: theft was encouraged by the laws
of Sparta: therefore the laws of Sparta encouraged
crime.

88. Every hen comes from an egg every egg comes
from a hen: therefore every egg comes from an egg.

89. Jupiter was the son of Saturn: therefore the son of
Jupiter was the grandson of Saturn.
90. All cold is to be expelled by heat: this person's
disorder is a cold : therefore it is to be expelled by heat.
91. Wine is a stimulant: therefore in a case where sti
mulants are hurtful, wine is hurtful.

92. Opium is a poison; but physicians advise some of
their patients to take Opium: therefore physicians advise
some of their patients to take poison.

93. What we eat grew in the fields; loaves of bread
are what we eat : therefore loaves of bread grew in the
fields.

94. Animal-food may be entirely dispensed with: (as is
shown by the practice of the Brahmins and of some monks);

and vegetable-food may be entirely dispensed with (as is

EXAMPLES.

331

plain from the example of the Esquimaux and others); but
all food consists of animal-food and vegetable-food: there
fore all food may be dispensed with.

95. No trifling business will enrich those engaged in it:
a mining speculation is no trifling business: therefore a
mining speculation will enrich those engaged in it.
96. He who is most hungry eats most: he who eats least
is most hungry: therefore he who eats least eats most.
[See Aldrich's Compendium : Fallaciae : where this is rightly solved.]

97. Whatever body is in motion must move either in

the place where it is, or in a place where it is not: neither
of these is possible: therefore there is no such thing as
motion. [In this instance, as well as in the one lately noticed, Aldrich

mistakes the character of the difficulty:

which is, not to prove the truth of

that which is self-evident, but to explain an apparent demonstration mili
tating against that which nevertheless no one ever doubted. He says in
this case, “solvitur ambulando;” but (pace tanti viri) this is no solution
at all, but is the very thing which constitutes the difficulty in question : for
it is precisely because we know the possibility of motion, that a seeming
proof of its impossibility produces perplexity.—See Introduction, p. 4.]

98. All vegetables grow most in the increase of the
moon: hair is a vegetable: therefore hair grows most in
the increase of the moon.

99. Most of the studies pursued at Oxford conduce to
the improvement of the mind: all the works of the most
celebrated ancients are among the studies pursued at Ox
ford: therefore some of the works of the most celebrated

ancients conduce to the improvement of the mind.

ing to separately, some portion of an object presented to
the mind, page 60.
Accident.—In its widest technical sense, anything that is attri
-

buted to another, and can only be conceived as belonging to
some substance (in which sense it is opposed to “Sub
stance”): in its narrower and more properly logical sense,

a Predicable which may be present or absent, the essence of
the Species remaining the same, 66.
Accidental Definition.—A definition which assigns the Proper
ties of a Species, or the Accidents of an Individual; it is
otherwise called a Description, 72.

Affirmative—denotes the quality of a Proposition which asserts

the agreement of the Predicate with the Subject, 77.
Analogous.-A term is so called whose single signification ap

plies with unequal propriety to more than one object, 60,
mote; and 168.

Antecedent.—That part of a Conditional Proposition on which
the other depends, 100.

Apprehension, (simple).-The operation of the mind by which we

335

Disjunctive Proposition—is one which consists of two or more
categoricals, so stated as to imply that some one of them

must be true. A Syllogism is called disjunctive the reason
ing of which turns on such a proposition, 112.
Distributed—is applied to a Term that is employed in its full
extent, so as to comprehend all its significates,—everything
to which it is applicable, 43, 78.

more than one Antecedent in the Major Premiss, and a dis
junctive Minor, 116.

Enthymeme.—An Argument having one Premiss expressed and
the other understood, 121.

Equivocal.—A Term is defined to be equivocal whose different
significations apply equally to several objects. Strictly
speaking, there is hardly a word in any language which may

not be regarded as, in this sense, equivocal ; but the title is
usually applied only in any case where a word is employed
equivocally; e.g., where the middle term is used in different

senses in the two Premises; or where a Proposition is lia
ble to be understood in various senses, according to the va

rious meanings of one of its terms, 165.
Essential Definition—is one which assigns, not the Properties or
Accidents of the thing defined, but what are regarded as its
essential parts, whether physical or logical, 71.
Ertreme.—The Subject and Predicate of a Proposition are called

stood to imply the Extremes of the Conclusion, 57.
Fallacy.—Any argument, or apparent argument, which professes
to be decisive of the matter at issue, while in reality it is
not, 131.

follows from the truth of the Exposita, or Proposition given,
83.

Impossible.—The Matter of a Proposition is so called when the
extremes altogether disagree, 81.

Indefinite Proposition—is one which has for its Subject a Com
mon term without any sign to indicate distribution or non
distribution, 78.

Individual.—An object which is, in the strict and primary sense,
one, and consequently cannot be logically divided ; whence

337

Judgement.—The second operation of the mind, wherein we pro
nounce mentally on the agreement and disagreement of two
of the notions obtained by Simple Apprehension, 54.
Logical definition—is that which assigns the Genus and Differ
ence of the Species defined, 72.

Major term of a Syllogism—is the Predicate of the conclusion.

The Major Premiss is the one which contains the Major
term. In Hypothetical Syllogisms, the Hypothetical Pre
miss is called the Major, 90, 108.
Middle term of a categorical Syllogism—is that with which the
two extremes of the conclusion are separately compared,
90, 108.

Minor term of a categorical Syllogism—is the Subject of the
conclusion.

The Minor Premiss is that which contains the

Minor term. In Hypothetical Syllogisms, the Categorical
Premiss is called the Minor, 90, 108.

Modal categorical proposition—is one which asserts that the Pre
dicate exists in the Subject in a certain mode or manner,
76, 106.

Mood of a categorical Syllogism—is the designation of its three
propositions, in the order in which they stand, according to
their quantity and quality, 94.

Necessary matter of a proposition—is the essential or invariable
agreement of its terms, 81.
Negative categorical proposition—is one which asserts the dis
agreement of its extremes, 77.

Nominal Definition—is one which explains only the meaning of
the term defined, and nothing more of the nature of the

thing signified by that Term than is implied by the Term
itself to every one who understands the meaning of it, 73,
232.

Opposed.—Two propositions are said to be opposed to each
other, when, having the same Subject and Predicate, they
differ either in quantity or quality, or both, 81.

Part—logically Species are called Parts of the Genus they come
under, and individuals, parts of the Species; really, the
Z

338

Genus is a Part of the Species, and the Species of the Indi
vidual, 68.

Particular proposition—is one in which the Predicate is affirmed

or denied of some part only of the subject, 77.
Per Accidens.—Conversion of a proposition is so called when the

Predicate of a proposition—is that Term which is affirmed or
denied of the other, 57.

Predicable.—A Term which can be affirmatively predicated of

Real definition—is one which explains the nature of the thing

defined; viz. either the whole nature of it, (as in Mathema
tics) or else something beyond what is necessarily under
stood by the Term, 73,232.
Quality of a Proposition—is its affirming or denying. This is the
Quality of the expression, which is, in Logic, the essential
circumstance. The Quality of the matter, is, its being true

or false; which is, in Logic, accidental, being essential
only in respect of the subject-matter treated of 77.

Quantity of a Proposition—is the extent in which its Subject is
taken ; viz. to stand for the whole, or for a part only, of its
Significates, 77.
