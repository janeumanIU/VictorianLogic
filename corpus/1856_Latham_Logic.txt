the title of the present work is by no means 
unexceptionable so sensible indeed is the author 
of the objections that lie against it that he is the 
first to take notice of them 

instead of passing for a work upon logic as ap 
plied to the study of language the following pages 
should be considered as an exposition of that amount 
of grammar and philology which applies to logic 
in other words the view suggested by the term 
should be reversed the language should lead 
to the logic and not the logic to the language 
the true relations of the two subjects to each other 
make a certain amount of the one a preliminary 
or introduction to the other this preliminary 
however lies in the phenomena of speecl these 
lead to logic but not vice verad 

why then does the present treatise give us as 
fer at least as its title goes precisely the reverse of 
this doctrine why does it treat logic as the pre 
liminary and language as the subject to which it 
conducts us 

 so much must be known of ttie elements of

iv preface 

logic in order that the common terms of grammar 
may be understood — so runs the import of our 
titlepage 

 so much of the elementary facts of language 
must be known before the study of logic com 
mences — so runs the real fiict 

so runs the real fact — at least in the eyes of the 
present writer and many like him who hold that 
in strict language logic begins with the syllogism 
and that the structure of single and vaconnected 
propositions is no portion of that science — that 
science dealing less with propositions themselves 
than with the relations which imder certain cir 
cumstances and with certain combinations they 
bear to each other 

the nature of the single or unconnected propo 
sition must of course be known it is submitted 
however that the knowledge of this is to be got 
from the study of language as applied to logic 

to this however as has been stated the import 
of the present titlepage runs directly contrary 
nor is the opposition difficult of explanation pro 
vided the commonplace and practical character of 
the treatise be borne in mind it i the wish of 
the writer to avail himself of an old name for a 
somewhat new study — the old name being logic 

now grammar being taught early and logic if 
taught at all late the effect of such a title as 
language applied to logic would be to engender 
the notion that the work wherein the application 
was exhibited was for adults rather than boys and 
youths its real object is the reverse of this its 
real object is to get certain socalled points of logic 
studied as early as the elements of grammar

pkefac v 

if the term logic be a misnomer the reason for 
its use kes in the contrast between the practice of 
the ordinary grammarians and the logicians of 
the former many admit that the nature of terms 
and copulas along with the structure of the propo 
sition is a matter which lies within their own 
jurisdiction on the other hand there are plenty 
of logicians who treat everything anterior to 
the syllogism as phenomena not of logic but of 
language the practice however nowhere or but 
rarely coincides with the theory look in an ordi 
nary grammar for anything about propositions and 
in ninetynine cases out of a hundred you will look 
in vain it is in the books upon logic that you will 
find them at the present moment i remember but 
one grammar written in english and written for 
the practical purpose of teaching a foreign lan 
guage rather than with a strictly scientific view 
wherein the truly grammatical phenomena of the 
structure of propositions are exhibited this is dr 
lees hebrew grammar and even here the notice 
is short and appears no earlier than the first page 
of the syntax throughout the etymology no 
word about propositions is spoken i repeat 
however that in thus limiting the grammars that 
treat of a proper grammatical logic i speak fiom 
memory there may be many others neverthe 
less — whether many or few they bear but a small 
proportion to those which relegate the subject to the 
domain of the logician 

and he always supplies them yet they are not 
his own wares and he would manifestly and ad 
vantageously disencumber his subject of more than 
one imnecessary appendage if presuming the gram

maxians to have cultivated their own domain up to 
its true boundary he supposed on the part of his 
reader a knowledge of terms copulas propositions 
names and the like and began his own subject 
where the preliminaries supplied by another ended 

enough however of the remarks upon the title 
of the work the work itself is by no means an 
ambitious one saving the sections upon the con 
vertibility of the pronoun and those wherein the 
connotation of names is quantified it contains 
next to nothing of original matter the im 
portance however of these i place high espe 
cially as elements in the natural history of lan 
guage 

this is a sea upon which if i consulted my in 
dinations only i would wiuingly launch but the 
mass of detail is enormous whilst the principles of 
criticism that should regulate its construction are 
but faintly foreshadowed nevertheless whenever 
such a natuial history is attempted the remarks 
just alluded to will find their place 

so far as they do this the present treatise con 
tains materials connected with the advancement 
rather than the mere diffusion of knowledge in 
all other respects however it is educational rather 
than scientific advertising and promulgating what 
is known rather than investigating and illustrating 
the unknown 

the line of study to which it is more especially 
preparatory so far as it deals with logic per se is 
easily seen inasmuch as it manifests itself trans 
parently through the names of the authors most 
especially quoted and the nature of the perhaps 
overabundant extracts these point to the writers

preface vll 

who above all others have within the last few 
years carried logic beyond the point where its re 
vivers by whom i mean the school to which arch 
bishop whately has been the coryphaeus left it — 
mill in his system of logic de morgan in his 
formal logic boole in his laws of thought 
and sir william hamilton in his discussions on 
philosophy and his edition of the works of eeid 

i repeat the statement that the present treatise 
is vmtten for young students and here the title 
logic has its disadvantage to many it conveys 
the idea of something subtle metaphysical difficidt 
sophistical and the like something useless or 
worse something quite as difficult as profitable 
— difficult at least to students of an early age 
and uncultivated imderstandings to those who 
think loosely enough to think thus the idea of 
boys being employed upon what they may choose 
to call chopping logic must be ridiculous 
 be it so i wish the name were more popular 
popular however or unpopular it is one with which 
even the unlearned are acquainted that logic is 
neither nonsense nor sophistry i shall not attempt 
to show i shall only ask how far it is difjicult 
— difficult for young students too difficult for 
being taught in schools 

many of the studies of youth are held to be 
adapted to the youthful capacities not so much 
because they are more or less easy but because 
they happen to be taught when such is the case 
the particular branch of education is not taught 
because it is easy but is easy because it is 
taught where there are many teachers methods 
of instruction improve simply from the practice of

conmmnicating knowledge being general opinions 
upon points connected with it become interchanged 
errors have a tendency to become exploded ideas 
are ventilated the result being that subjects lose 
much of their difficulty when they lose their 
novelty 

this is not the case with logic and its allied 
subjects there is no trained body of teachers 
no series of explanatory books no logic made 
easy 

the exact time of life for the study of elemen 
tary logic is not to be given in years and months 
the age however at which ordinary grammar as it 
is usually taught is understood is the time of life 
at which anything conveyed by the forthcoming 
pages can be understood also how far the mean 
ing of such words as substantive adjective noun 
concord and the like along with the socalled rules 
of orthography etymology syntax and prosody is 
actually understood teachers in schools and classes 
know better than i they have doubtless too 
good reasons for teaching them even when not un 
derstood as is too often the case 

now what i hold respecting the logical part of 
language as compared with grammar as usually 
taught is this — 

 that as far as the thing taught is to be 
imderstood terms and copulas are no whit more 
unintelligible or difficult than nouns and verbs 

 that if the memory is to be appealed to 
without the understanding the appeal may as well 
be made for logic as for grammar 

this means that where grammar can be taught 
logic can be taught also the one subject being in

reality no harder or more inaccessible than the 
other 

the real amount of thought is much the same on 
both sides indeed the thought is of the same 
kind it results in the analysis of what we say or 
write and the observation of what we think the 
terminology certainly is the easier in logic the 
logical terms remarkable for either their length or 
exotic origin are only three in number — categore 
matic syncategorematic and hypercategorematic 
and these may at first by a little management on 
the part of the teacher be dispensed with of the 
remainder the list is but short it consists of — 



subject 


conciete 


predicate 


abstract 


copula 


denotation 


term 


connotation 


proposition 


summum genus 


substance 


infima species 


attribute 


subaltern 



and a few others less distantly removed from the 
language of common life will any one say that 
these are more diflscult of either explanation on the 
part of the teacher or remembrance on the part of 
the learner than the longer and more technical list 
consisting of names like — 

article adverb 

substan tive preposition 

adjective conjunction 

noun interjection 

pronoim copulative 

verb disjunctive 

participle indicative

and the like 

if logic be too difficult for beginners grammar is 
too difficult also 

it is submitted however that the real difficulties 
lie in the facts already alluded to viz the slight 
extent to which the subject has been made a branch 
of early education the intrinsic difficulties of the 
subject being but small 

the sections whereof the numbers stand in pa 
rentheses need not be attended to at the first

btatements assertions declarations or proposi

§ the first subject that requires to be con 
sidered is the nature of statements assertions 
declarations or propositions 

in order to understand what is meant by a 
proposition let us suppose that two persons are 
talking together 

they talk about something let us suppose 
that they talk about bread 

bread being the something concerning which 
they talk what is it that they say about it 

let us suppose that they say that it is dear 

they then make the statement declaration or 
assertion that bread is dear and this statement 
declaration or assertion is in the language of 
logidans and grammarians a proposition

 propositions 

let us now suppose their conversation to have 
been heard by some third person and reported to 
a fourth and that the two on their part talk it 
over after the following fashion — 

dialogue 

a what was said by the two men you saw just now 

b a great deal they talked together more than an 
hour 

a what did they say 

b more than i can remember i only know that 
they talked about something or other one of them 
tallied about bread 

a what did he say 

b something that i did not quite understand but 
which was contradicted by the other 

 what did hesy 

b something that the other disapproved of 

a so all that you can tell me is that they talked about 
something 

b aye and that something was bread 

a and that they said something about it 

b they said a good deal about it and as fast as one 
said something one way the other said something another 
way 

a did either of them say that it was dear 

b yes 

a and did the other say that it was cheap 

b he did 

so end the two conversations which four 
imaginary speakers have made for the sake of 
illustrating the nature of a proposition we might 
have made two serve our purpose four how 
ever make the matter somewhat clearer we 
might indeed have done with only one for it

propositions 

requires no great stretch of the imagination to 
suppose a single person talking to himself or 
writing in either of which cases he would be in 
a condition to form propositions for the sake 
however of giving all the prominence possible to 
the essential and fundamental character of the 
proposition the dramatis personse were raised to 
the number of four 

which of these speakers is right and which 
wrong the one whose statement assertion 
declaration or proposition is true is right and 
the one whose statement assertion declaration or 
proposition is untrue is wrong common sense 
teus us this there is a reason however for 
asking the question it suggests the fact that 
propositions are at least of two kinds either true 
or false the men who make them being right or 
wrong accordingly 

which then of the two staments assertions 
declarations or propositions is true and which 
untrue this is a question which we cannot 
answer inasmuch as we do not know what par 
ticular bread is talked about and even if we 
did we might not ourselves know the price of it 
all we know is that two persons speaking about 
breadj make different statements 

but these statements are opposite and contra 
dictory to one another hence we may fairly say 
that as both cannot be true one of them must be 
the contrary or untrue even tliis however is 
more than we are justified in asserting inasmuch 
as we are by no means certain that they both talk 
about the same bread we have a notion that 
they do nevertheless this notion is very far from

 propositions 

being a certainty we have only learnt a part of 
the conversation whereas if we had had the whole 
the result might have been that the bread which was 
declared cheap was the bread of one year the 
bread which was declared dear the bread of another 

we need not however go ftirther in this ques 
tion for it is not the price of bread that we are 
investigating neither have we any interest in the 
comparative merits of the statements of our two 
speakers both may be right inasmuch as they 
may be talking of different breads or both 
may be wrong inasmuch as bread may have been 
neither dear nor cheap but moderate in price or 
one may have been wrong and the other right 
we do not however care which of the two it was 
yet the price of bread is seldom or never a matter 
of indifference to either us or any one else we 
may not perhaps either make or sell but the 
chances are strongly in favour of our either buying 
it or consuming it besides this the political 
economists tell us that the price of bread enters 
into the price of everything else so that the 
question is anything but an indifferent one 

the fact however is that the case before us is 
not one of either domestic or social economy 
at all but merely an illustration drawn from those 
departments of inquiry for another and a very 
different investigation an investigation which we 
have undertaken not as millers or bakers or 
buyers of bread or economists of any kind but as 
grammarians and it is only with the eye of a 
grammirian that we look upon such sentences as 
the one under notice 

all propositions must be either spoken or

propositions 

written by some one they cannot make them 
selves neither are they selfexistent they are 
made in words by some one who uses language 

whab do they convey at the first view of 
this question we are inclined to answer that they 
convey a fact yet this is not the case a speaker 
may as easily put an incorrect statement in the 
shape of a proposition as a correct one he may 
as easily say gold is not yellow which is contrary to 
feet as gold is yellow which is a true and real fact 

propositions then by no means convey facts 
that is they by no means necessarily and essen 
tially do so they may do so but they do not do 
so on the strength of their being propositions 

do they convey the belief on the part of the 
speaker that what he asserts is a fact not 
exactly though something like it the same per 
son who has said gold is yellow may immediately 
afterwards and in the very next breath or sentence 
say gold is twt yellow he cannot be said to 
believe both these assertions 

what a proposition conveys is this it conveys 
what the speaker chooses to pass off as his belief 
so that it may give us something in which he 
reauy believes or it may give us something that he 
does not believe in at all 

examples 

 man is mortal — this is true 

 man is fiveheaded — this is false 

 man is man — this is true and something 
more it is so true that it is unnecessary to be

 propositions 

 somebody is nobody — this is not only false 
but impossible 

 bread is dear — this in the mouth of a 
person who believes when he utters it that bread 
is actually dear is a real belief and if the price be 
actually high it is a true fiict again — 

 bread is dear — this in the mouth of a 
person who believes when he utters it that bread 
is really cheap is a simulated or pretended belief 
even if it be true as a statement 

all which instances serve to show that truths 
falsehoods truisms wilful perversions of fiujt mis 
takes and even impossibilities may form equally

we speak about and the something we say con

the third part member element or coiistitvnt 
of propositions — the word is 

§ it now remains for us to ask whether these 
same parts members or elements of a proposition 
are more than two 

it is by no means impossible to frame an intel 
ligible sentence out of the two elements wliich have 
been the subject of the foregoing remarks alone 
indeed children do so very often the child says 
sun bright or fire burn and is understood so 
are the upgrown men of more countries than one 
in the languages of which the tliird part member or 
element of a proposition is omitted 

it is not however the business of the men and 
women who use language to make propositions 
that are simply intelligible or capable of being 
understood it is their business to make proposi 
tions which cannot be misunderstood and to do 
this they must use something more than the words 
expressive of our two somethings 

no man can conclude to a certainty that because 
he sees certain words in juxtaposition they are in a 
given relation to each other no man can con 
clude to a certainty that they are in any relation 
at all he may indeed make a good guess but 
he can do no more 

there is then a third part member or ele 
ment generally found in most propositions and 
without which as will be seen hereafter many 
propositions cannot be constructed this expresses 
over and above the two somethings already men

took care that whilst the number of the parts 
members or elements of the propositions was no 
more than three the number of the words by 
which the proposition was expressed should also 
be no more than three he did this however 
only for the sake of clearness and simplicity for it

one of his examples might have been increased and

them have begun with the word the — 

the summer is coming 
the winter is departing 

how little would the other propositions have been 
affected if instead of simply saying

we had said

propositions affirmative or negative 

§ in all the previous examples we have had 
a statement of a very clear and definite kind and 
we have not only had a very clear and definite 
statement or assertion but that statement or asser 
tion has been what is called affirmative the 
supposed speaker has said 

bread is dear 

water ls scarce fee 
but it by no means follows that because he says so 
the fact should agree with his statement still less 
that all the world should agree with him on the 
contrary we are at liberty to bring another speaker 
on the stage and to make him express a series of 
statements or assertions diametrically opposite to 
those of our first dramatis persona thus when 
a says 

bread is dear 

water is scarce c 
let b say 

bread is cheap 
water is abundant c 

what takes place when this happens we get two 
opposition statements or assertions declarations or 
propositions 

now although these statements or assertions are 
antagonistic or contradictory to each other they are

propositions 

both equally affirmative they are both equally 
affirmative though the one actually denies what the 
other states the denial however is anything but 
direct on the contrary it is got at in a somewhat 
roundabout way it is got at by making an 
affirmative assertion incompatible with the one to 
which it stands in opposition 

the man who says that bread is cheap leaves his 
hearer to infer that bread is not dear and his 
hearer draws this inference without much difficulty 
because he knows at once that a thing cannot be 
cheap and dear at the same time it cannot 
at one and the same time be something and its 
opposite and vice versd the speaker who com 
mits himself to the doctrine that bread is cheap 
means to say that it is not dear on the same prin 
ciple it cannot be two things at once thus 
whilst one denies that bread is dear and another 
that it is cheap neither of them expresses his de 
nial in the form of a negative they only leave 
a negative to be inferred 

but what if instead of thus meeting one affir 
mation by another they had recourse to the little 
word not in this case one of the two words 
dear and cheap could be dispensed with for it 
would be sufficient to say 

bread is not cheap 
instead of 

bread is dear 
or 

bread is not dear 

instead of 

bread is cheap

order of the three parts members or elements of a 
proposition — copula in the middle 

§ enough has now been written concerning 
the number of the parts members or elements of 
propositions enough and perhaps more than 
enough so ample has been the exposition of a 
question that at first sight seems sufficiently 
simple to be explained in a few words such im 
portance too has been given to the number three 
that it almost looks as if after the fashion of the 
old cabalist philosophers we founii something 
mystic in it nevertheless there are good reasons 
for the prominence that this number has assumed 

the question of order comes next 

in all the examples hitherto given the subject 
has come first the copula next and the predicate 
last just as if the sequence were invariable 
thus — 

 bread or water subject 

 is • copula 

 dear or scarce predicate 

such is the usual course in the english language 
as well as in many others in the english it is 
much more natural to say — 

water is scarce

 propositions 

than 

scarce is water 
though the latter expression is by no means either 
unintelligible or inpossible even such a phrase as 

scarce water is 
is imaginable 

there is no need however of going to these 
extreme and artificial forms in order to show that 
the usual sequence is by no means the only one 
even in english it often suits the purpose of the 
rhetorician to transpose the predicate and the sub 
ject plain prose would say 
diana of the ephesians is great 

but it is only the very plainest prose that would 
do so our fine translation of the scriptures as 
is well known gives us— 

great is diana of the ephesians 

in latin even the copula may be final e g 
vocatua sum am called so it does in our own 
language in such phrases as 

proud i am 

as far then as the ordinary practice of the 
english language is concerned the order of the 
parts members or elements of a proposition is re 
gular so regular that we should not be far wrong if 
we talked of the first second or third prepositional 
elements instead of talking of subjects copulas or 
predicates on the other hand however the eodror 
ordinary cases within the pale of our own language 
along with the pratice of many other tongues 
imply that the sequence is really a matter of 
indiflference

pboposrrions 

but although the order of the words may be 
indifferent the order of the ideas that they express 
may be regular 

again although the order of the ideas may be 
indifferent the inventors of the words subject 
copula and predicate may not have thought them 
so more than this they may have framed their 
phraseology accordingly now this seems to have 
been the case whatever were the places of the 
subject and predicate the copula stood between 
them for the meaning of the word copula is link 
union tie or connection 



 

general name for subject and predicate — term 

§ the question of the order or sequence of 
the parts of a proposition brings us towards the 
introduction of a new word 

terminus is the latin for a boundary limit 
or end 

as the copulas stood between the subjects and the 
predicates of a proposition the subjects and the 
predicates themselves must have stood at its two 
ends limits or boundaries which stood first and 
which stood last which began the proposition and 
which ended was a matter of indifference it was 
enough that between them they gave it its limits 
that each was mmmedial final or terminal 

and now we get a new word in the shape of a 
general name for subject and predicate collectively 
— the word term a word of which we have

remarks on the copula — apparent absent of a 
predicate 

§ we have seen that a predicate under cer 
tain conditions can be something more than a 
predicate i e a predicate and copula as well 

can a copula under any condition or modifica 
tion be anything more than a copula especially 
can it be a copula and predicate also to this 
question many logicians say yes they say that 
isis eodstingis an existence is a hemgis 
an entity or something of this kind and that 
when the predicate implies simple eodstence it can 
be expressed by the copula alone such is the case 
in the sentence god is which is considered to con 
sist of a subject and copula alone to this view 
several writers mill amongst them object and 
that very decidedly arguing that a copula as a 
copula is merely a sign of predication and nothing 
more the instances therefore in question are 
merely instances of the ambiguity of the word 
by which the copula is expressed the word 
is — a word which not only performs the function 
of a copula but has a meaning of its own by 
virtue of which it may itself be made a predicate 
— is not a copula which has enlarged its powers

pbopositions 

but th dgn of the copula which has a double 
function 

such an error as the one befwe us is best 
guarded against by bearing in mind the essentially 
relative character of the copula all that it ex 
lresses in any proposition is agreement or dis 
agreement between the two terms 

let a stand for the subject 
„ b „ „ predicate 

 „ „ affirmative copula 

„ „ „ negative copula 

and all such errors are avoided 



 

remarks on the copula — division between the 
several parts of a proposition — incidence of 
the negative mement — jsegative predicates t 

§ the present section is devoted to what may 
be called the incidence of the negative element 
it will show that certain writers have divided the 
proposition into its three parts differently the gene 
rality having referred the negative element to the 
copula whilst some have connected it with the 
predicate 

a by changing is into is not we convert an 
affirmative into a negative proposition this is 
how the statement stands in words 

 by changing into we convert a b into 
atb this is how the statement stands in 
symbols 

from this it follows that it is the character of

 propositions 

the copula that determines the character of the 
proposition the rules being that — 

a affirmative copulas make affirmative proposi 
tions and vice versa that — 

b negative copidas make negative propositions 
such is the current doctrine but it is clear 

that a very little ingenuity may modify it an 
affirmative copida with a negative predicate will 
give us the same result as an affirmative predicate 
with a negative copula thus — 

caesar is not dead 

may be read either 

caesar isnot dead or — 
caesar is notdead 

if this be true the symbolic formula lately sug 
gested requires alteration if so — 

let a stand for the subject 
„ b „ „ affirma 
„ b „ „ negati 
„ „ „ copula 

here we get rid of but take b in its place 

this difference of the distribution of the nega 
tive element of propositions has not obtained the 
assent of either the major or the most distin 
guished part of our recent writers 

extract 

 some logicians state this distinction differently they 
recognise only one form of copula is and attach the nega 
tive sign to the predicate csesar is dead and caesar is 
not dead according to these writers are propositions 
agreeing not in the subject and predicate but in the sub

propositions 

ject only they do not consider dead but not dead to 
be the predicate of the second proposition and they ac 
cordingly define a negative proposition to be one in which 
the predicate is a negative name the point though not 
of much practical moment deserves notice as an example 
not unfrequent in logic where by means of an apparent 
simplification but which is merely verbal matters are 
made more complex than before the idea of these writers 
was that thej could get rid of the distinction between 
affirming and denying by treating every case of denying 
as the affirming of a negative name but what is meant 
by a negative name a name expressive of the absence 
of an attribute so that when we affirm a negative name 
what we are really predicating is absence and not pre 
sence we are asserting not that anything is but that 
something is not to express which operation no word 
seems so proper as the word denying the fundamental 
distinction is between a fact and the nonexistence of that 
fact between seeing something aud not seeing it between 
caesars being dead and his not being dead and if this 
were a merely verbal distinction the generalisation which 
brings both within the same form of assertion would be a 
real simplification the distinction however being real 
and in the facts it is the generalisation confounding the 
distinction that is merely verbal and tends to obscure the 
subject by treating the diflference between two kinds of 
truths as if it were only a diflference between two kinds of 
words to put things together and to put them or keep 
them asunder will remain diflperent operations whatever 
tricks we may play with language — mills logic i

dear that those who take the view of hobbes for 
it is to the view of that writer that mill takes his 
exceptions and those who take the other admit 
but one formula the doctrine on both sides being 
that either the copida or the predicate is negative 
and that as a general rule but is this assxmiption 
the true one may we not err in looking towards 
simplicity too exclusively what if hobbes view 
be the true one in some the ordinary in other 
cases propositions would then be less uniform 
in their construction less simple in their form and 
less manageable in their handling logic in short 
would be somewhat more complex but this is no 
reason for ignoring a distinction provided that the 
distinction be real grenerality and simplicity are 
good things but they must not be bought at the 
price of facts 

the present writer suggests that in philology at 
least it may be inaccurate to hold that because the 
negative belongs to the copula in aome cases it 
does so in au 

and it may be just as inaccurate to maintain 
that because it aometimes attaches itself to the pre 
dicate it is essentially and necessarily predicative 

he believes that negatives are sometimes what 
he woidd call terminal and sometimes interter 
minal terminal negatives belonging to the predi 
cate rather than the copula interterminals to the 
copula rather than the predicate 

as a philologue he goes farther still he doubts 
whether it be in accordance with the phenomena of 
language to make the negative element of proposi

nected with the latter of these two subjects which 
has not some bearing upon the former it may pos 
sibly be wrong to say that our modes of speaking act 
upon our modes of thinking in other words that 
thought without language would be something 
different from thought with language it would 
not be expressed so as to be inteuigible to a second 
person nevertheless it would be thought 

again it may possibly be right to say that 
language is limited to the eocpression of our thoughts 
just as pictures express the objects they represent 
and the letters of the alphabet stand as signs of 
certain sounds and that language so limited has 
nothing to do but to take thought as it finds it 
and put it in a form that shall communicate it to 
some one external to the sentient or thinker the 
sentient or thinker beiug able to commune with 
himself without language i e to think to himself 
without talking to himself 

all this may be true nevertheless excellent 
logicians and i believe a vast majority of them 
hold that language is not only the expression of 
thought but to a certain extent the instrument by 
which thought is formed

logic is a portion of the art of thinking language 
is evidently and by the admission of all philosophers one 
of the principal instruments or helps of thought and any 
imperfection in the instruments or in the mode of employ 
ing it is confessedly liable still more than in almost any 
other art to confuse and impede the process and destroy 
all ground of confidence in the result for a mind not 
previously versed in the meaning and right use of the 
various kinds of words to attempt the study of methods of 
philosophising would be as if some one should attempt to 
make himself an astronomical observer having never 
learned to adjust the focal distance of his optical instruments 
 as to see distinctly — mills logic i 

 

 here therefore we find a new reason why the signifi 
cation of names and the relation generally between 
names and the things signified by them must occupy the 
preliminary stage of the inquiry we are engaged in 

 it may be objected that the meaning of names can 
guide us at most only to the opinions possibly the foolish 
and groundless opinions which mankind have formed con 
cerning things and that as the object of philosophy is 
truth not opinion the philosopher should dismiss words 
and look into things themselves to ascertain what ques 
tions can be asked and answered in regard to them this 
advice which fortunately no one has it in his power to 
follow is in reality an exhortation to discard the whole 
fruits of the labours of his predecessors and demean him 
self as if he were the first person who had ever turned an 
inquiring eye upon nature

amount to after subtracting all which he has acquired by

 that language is an instrument of human reason and 
not merely a medium for the expression of thought is a 
truth generally admitted it is proposed in this chapter 
to inquire what it is that renders language thus suhser 
vient to the most important of our intellectual faculties 
in the various steps of this inquiry we shall he led to 
consider the constitution of language considered as a 
system adapted to an end or purpose to investigate its 
elements to seek to determine their mutual relation and 
dependence and to inquire in what manner they contri 
hute to the attainment of the end to which as coordinate 
parts of a system they have respect 

 in proceeding to these inquiries it will not be neces

of the schools whether language is to be regarded as an 
essential instrument of reasoning or whether on the other 
hand it is possible for us to reason without its aid i 
suppose this question to be beside the design of the present 
treatise for the following reason viz that it is the busi 
ness of science to investigate laws and that whether we 
regard signs as the representatives of things and of their 
relations or as the representatives of the conceptions and 
operations of the human intellect in studying the laws of 
signs we are in effect studying the manifested laws of rea 
soning if there exists a difference between the two 
inquiries it is one which does not effect the scientific ex 
pressions of formal law which are the objects of investiga 
tion in the present stage of this work but relates only to 
the mode in which those results are presented to the 
mental regard for though in investigating the law 
of signs a posteriori the immediate subject of examina

could we easily conceive that the unnumbered tongues and

questions 

§ all statements assertions or declarations are 
propositions 

is the converse of this true 

are all propositions statements assertions or de 
clarations 

up to the present stage of our inquiries the 
three parts members or constituent elements of a 
proposition — the two somethings and the link that 
joins them — the subject predicate and copula — 
have been considered from one point of view only 

let us now however instead of saying 
bread is dear 
say 

is bread dear 

does this latter combination of words constitute 
a proposition 

it certainly has some of the elements of one and 
those very important ones 

it contains the two words significant of the two 
somethings — bready dear it contains the word 
which connects them — is

 propositions 

it contains all this and it contains notliing be 
sides a chemist would say that a sentence like 
the one in question gave us the same elements as 
the other with a different arrangement 

nevertheless there is no assertion no state 
ment no declaration none at least of a direct 
and straightforward kind 

instead of this there is a question 

now at the first view few things can be more 
unlike each other than a question and an assertion 
the latter implies knowledge the former the want 
of it the latter contains a certain amount of 
information real or supposed the former seeks for 
such information and for this reason the chief 
works on logic have formally and by name ex 
cluded queationa firom the class of propositions 
all however that the grammarian says is that a 
question is not an assertion a declaration or a 
statement all that the grammarian says is that 
whenever there is an assertion a declaration or a 
statement there is also a proposition he never 
says that wherever there is a proposition there is 
also a statement 

the feet is that in grammar a question is 
neither more nor less than a variety of the ordinary 
proposition implying that the subject is something 
concerning which the speaker requires information 
something unexplained but not incapable of ex 
planation explanation that may possibly be sup 
plied by the person spoken to 

the sentence — 

what is this this is what 
what something upon which information is re 
quested 

it may be objected however that it is not the

propositions 

habit of language to use such expressions as this is 
wttat but on the contrary to prefer the form what 
is this all that need be said upon this point is 
that it is not the general custom of the english 
and certain other languages to do so the eng 
ush and certain other languages transpose the 
predicate and subject when the proposition is a 
question but there is no necessity for their doing 
so it is merely a particular practice and no ge 
neral law of language 

a question then or interrogation is only an 
ordinary assertional or declaratory proposition with 
its parts transposed 

 

questions of appeal 

§ there is a certain sort of question which 
is neither more nor less than a negative when a 
person in extreme perplexity says what am i to 
cfo he often means that there is nothing that can 
be done in like manner — 

whxd do you say to that means you have no 
thing to say to it 

who would rely on the word of a convicted 
perjurer or on the honour of a notorious cheat 
kete who means no one 

in questions of this kind we not only appeal 

to the person spoken as to whether such or such 

a feet is true but we imply our own belief to 

the contrary in which case our last example means 

 know of n one who relies on the word and 

honour of perjurers and cheats and have a strong 

conviction that nx one does do so

propositions 

 

orammatical propositions of three kinds — declara 
tory interrogative and imperative 

§ a proposition that conveys an assertion 
statement or declaration i called a declaratory 
proposition it may also be called an assertional 
one 

a proposition by which we ask a question is 
called an vnterrogative proposition 

a proposition that conveys a command is called 
an imperative proposition 

the grammarian recognizes all these three 
varieties as propositions the logician recognizes 
the first only questions and commands he ex 
cludes in his eyes there is no proposition where 
there is no declaration or assertion

the lines will then run thus — 

man is good c 

a child is little 

the bow is small 

the woman is thinking 

the water is beaten c c 

in any sort of combination or to any number 

or we may throw the two lists into two 
columns the former on the left the latter on the 
right side of the paper and connect the two by 
is writing — 

the man good 

the woman r is bad 

the child indifferent c 

in each and au of these instances we have a 
proposition — a proposition with its subject at the 
beginning or on the lefthand side as we write 
its predicate at the end or righthand side and 
its copula between them or in the middle 

some of these propositions are felse improbable 
and even impossible nevertheless they are all 
propositions grammatically constructed and accu 
rate in form and this is au that need be

the subjects of propositions

 propositions 

they have also shown that there is another class 
which can constitute the predicates 

can the same words constitute hoth subjects and 
predicates 

let us answer this by again operating on our 
lists 

reverse the order of the columns by writing the 
words of no on the lefthand side of the paper 
and those of no on the right 

good is man 
little is child 
small is bow 
thinking is woman 
beaten is water c c 

are these sentences grammatical do they 
constitute propositions no it may be said 
that they are intelligible and that if interpreted 
so as to be made so they would be no more un 
true improbable or impossible than some of the 
acknowledged propositions of the previous section 
it may be said for instance that good littlsy small 
c mean a good thing a little thing goodness or 
littleness c and that 

goodness is a man 
littleness is a child c 

are propositions the qualities in question may it 
may be said have been personified so that good 
ness may be a man just as britannia is a woman 
or cupid a boy ah this may be the case but if 
it be so the words must have changed their mean

propositions 

ing in the plain unvarnished language of common 
sense no one will say that 

gkod is man 

is a proposition in the same way as 

man is good 
is one 

again it may be said that combinations like 
good is mem are combinations like one already 
quoted viz great is diqna of tjie ephesicmsf which 
is the same as diana of the uphesians is great 
this however is by no means an instance of the 
word great being used as a subject it is only an 
instance of the usual order of the subject and pre 
dicate being reversed 

we may then safely say there is a certain dass 
of words — words like those in no — which can 
form the predicates of propositions but not the 
subjects and this gives us a partial answer to 
the question with which we commenced viz can 
the same word constitute both subjects and predi 
cates 

answer whatever may be the case with the 
words of no the words of no have no such 
double power they constitute predicates only 
 

practice in columns — words capable of forrmng

asmuch as it applies only to the words of list

examples of this kind may be multiplied inde

cause the words in question though capable of 
forming parts of either a subject or a predicate 
cannot form a whole one 

the previous examples have shown something 
more they have shown that it by no means 
follows that because a word can by itself consti 
tute the whole of a term it cannot therefore con 
stitute a part of one a the in very c can 
constitute parts of terms only iron good c can 
constitute whole terms but they can constitute parts 
of terms as well

samples of a class

that the words which it contained man good c

formed being of course simple

the character of the class now claiming conside 
ration is that the words which it contains a very 
in c are not capable of forming by themselves 
but only with the aid of other words terras the 
terms thus formed are of course other than abso 
lutely simple 

the class last under notice fell into certain divi 
sions one containing the words capable of forming 
both subjects and predicates another the words 
capable of forming predicates only another the 
words that formed predicates and copulas as well 
hence whilst tnaa and good agreed in the general 
character of being able by themselves to form 
terms the terms that they severally formed were 
diflferent 

the same applies to the class containing a the 
very in c they agree geverally ie they agree 
in the fact of their powers or fiinctions being 
limited to the formation of parts of terms only 
they differ in the particular parts of a term that 
they severally have the power or function to

propodtions universal or particular 

§ it may perhaps have already struck the 
reader that the division of propositions into nega 
tive and aflirmative the only division hitherto 
made has been insufficient if so he will anti 
cipate the introduction of new terms some of which 
may be more or less technical and this is exactly 
what he wiu find propositions may be of any 
amount of simplicity or complexity they may be 
threeworded i e with no more words than elements 
or they may extend over whole lines and fill up 
moderatesized pages 

in the following pair of propositions one of 
which is negative and the other affirmative it is 
more important to notice the likeness between them 
than the difference 

swans are white 
swans are not white 

all the parts here are clear the words swan 
and white tell us what is meant by the subject and 
the predicate the words are and are not give us the 
copulas all then is clear — but only to a certain 
extent for a little reflection wiu show us that 
there is still a piece of information wanting 

how many swans are white how maay swans 
are not white this is what we have yet to be 
told it may be that the whole class genus or 
group of swans — every individual bird belonging to 
it — is of the same colour or it may be that only 
one per cent thereof is so what in short does 
the word swcms mean does it mean all or some

propositions 

the whole of a class or the part of one does 
it mean swcma universally or swans partially all 
that the wording of the proposition supplies us 
with is the statement that there is more than one 
swan which is white more than one swan other 
than white this we collect from the copula being 
are instead of is and it is all that we do collect 

so that our notion of a proposition is stiu in 
complete and we still want a fresh dass of words 
nor is it difficult to see what sort of words these 
must be they must stand in the very closest 
juxtaposition with the subject they must ahnost 
be part and parcel of the subject they must com 
bine or coalesce with the subject much in the same 
way that the negative combines with the copula 
whether they will be separate words or words in 
separably united will depend upon circumstances 

the two chief words of this kind are all and 
some as we may see by prejbxing them to the two 
propositions under notice and writing 

jztswans are white 
isomeswans are not white 

by writing all or some we know what we may 
call the extent or quantity of our proposition ie 
we know how far the words white and not white ex 
tend to the class of birds called swans we know 
that in the first proposition they extend over the 
whole dass whereas in the second they extend 
over only a part of it 

to say that soms swans are white is to say that 
a portion or part of the class of birds called swan 
is endued with the property or attribute of white 
nms — a portion or part not the whole some of

 propositions 

them may be brown some even black what are 
we to call such an affirmative as this an affirmative 
that applies only to a part of a class we are to 
call it a particular ajffirmaiive just as we called 
the other a universal one if we choose we may 
contrast these two sorts of propositions we must 
remember however that they are both affirmative 
the same difference presents itself when we come 
to the negative 

no swan is white 

some swans are not white 

the first of which is an universal the second a 
particular negative 

there are then four sorts or species of propo 
sitions and these it is the business of the logician 
to arrange or classify in doing this he has his 
choice between two principles 

a he may do as has just been done he may 
make the primary divisions affirmative and 
oiegative each billing into the universal and par 
ticular or subdivisions in which cases his table 
stands thus — 

universal — all swans are 

 white 

particular — some swans are 

white 
universal — no swans are 

white 
particular — some swans are 
not white 
or 

 he may make the division into universal and 
particular primary and that of affirmative and 



affirmatives 



negatives

propositions 

negative secondary if he do this his table stands 
as follows — 

affirmative — au swans are 

white 
negative — no swans are 

white 
affirmative — some swans are 

white 
negative — some swans are 
not white 



universal 



particular 



now it is this latter arrangement which is 
the arrangement of the logician in whose writings 
the sequence which it is very important to re 
member is — 

 universal affirmative 

 „ negative 

 particular affirmative 

 „ negative 

we now proceed to the consideration of —

i should be glad to think that either the present 
work or some work like it was to be studied 
earlier than even the first rules of the ordinary 
grammars but this is a thing to be desired rather 
than expected — optandum mxigls quam sperandum 
such being the case i assume that the ordinary 
grammatical meaning of such words as mxisculine 
feminine neuter and gender is understood by the 
reader

 propositions 

now the old grammarians are in the habit 
of speaking of the relative value dignity or 
worth of these three genders the masculine 
they say is more worthy than the feminine and 
the feminine more worthy than the neuter they 
generally proceed to show what this means by 
examples i stop however here using the words 
only as an illustration for — 

just as one gender in grammar is more worthy 
than another one class of words in logic has greater 
worth than its fellows and it is evident where 
this greater worth or value lies it is to be found 
with those words which can not only form by 
themselves and singlehanded terms but terms of 
either kind a word that can be both predicate 
and subject may fairly be called worthier than one 
which can form a predicate only a word like sun 
for instance is a worthier word so to say than a 
word like bright

at present we have no names for the classes to 
which they belong to speak of wordswhichcan

 words like sun — words that can be either

 words like bright — words that can be predi

 words like shirpewords that can be copulas

with this preliminary we may investigate the 
natme of manyworded terms 

before we have jfinished doing this other classes 
of words will have to be treated in a similar 
manner first — 

 the words by which we expressed the extent of 
propositions require notice — all some nx these

word which they precede rather than as separate 
words ijallswans someswatis nxswaas the 
fuller explanation of this will appear in the sequel 

the same applies to the little words an a and 
the and it applies to them even more strongly and 
decidedly than it did to all som and none in

ence at all we cannot use them by themselves

let us keep however as much as possible to the

to our previous list which now runs thus sun

the same class as svn 

with and through belong to the same class as of 

what is the principle upon which these several 
words and the words like them combine so as to 
form manywordedterms 

first rule — this is the rule for words like 
bright they combine with words like sun and 
that without the interposition of any intermediate 
link — the bright sun they can however form 
terms by themselves i e they can form predicates 
hence they suggest no new class having been 
already considered this is not the case with the 
words that come next they give us new classes

second rule — this is for words like cheerfully 
which can only form parts of terina they com 
bine only with words like bright we cannot say 
the cheerfully sun shines we com say the cheer 
fully bright sun shvnes 

we can also say the bright sun shines cheer 
fully or the cheerful swn shines brightly for 
cheerfully is in the same class with brightly and 
cheerful is in the same class with bright 

but is not this an exception to the rule is 
not shines in a different class from bright it is 
and it is not shines is shining and shining 
and bright are in the same class bright is a word 
that forms a predicate so is shining but shines 
is a predicate and copula as well hence when 
we say the sun shines brightly we attach the word 
brightly to the predicative and not to the copular 
part of shine 

 the sun shines the sun is shining 

 the sun shines brightly the sun is shining 

brightly 

or 

 the sun is brightlyshining

 the sun isbrightly shining 
we caumot say —

like avm summer becum and air and with no 
others we cannot say — 

this is the sun of bright 

we can say — 

this is the sun of summer 

more than this they cannot enter into the struc 
ture of a term unless there be not only me word 
like un with which alone they can be combined 
but two such strike out from the example last 
given either of the two words sun or summer 
and you must strike out of also 

now it is clear that in the different places in 
the structure of manyworded terms which these 
several words fill we have the basis of a division 
of them into classes 

one of these contains words like a an and the 
which blend themselves almost inseparably with 
words like sun summer beam c 

an anatomist may compare these combinations 
to the bones and ligaments of the human body 
with which his professional studies have made him 
familiar if so he sees in such combinations as 
ormn and thesun two parts joined or jointed 
together — articulate as he calls them in the lan 
guage of his science articulate from the latin 
word articulus joint knucue what if we see 
in some ftiture page of this work this word ar 
ticulus again and that with a meaning very unlike 
its anatomical one it will not be the only in ¦

finger has one longer and two shorter joints a 
dactyle has one longer and two shorter syllables 

a second of these suggested classes contains 
cheerfully and a vast number of words like it 
words which may be said to qualify the meaning 
of terms like bright or shining and this is what 
they do they do it however in various ways 

sometimes they give us the mcmner in which 
the predicate applies to the subject 

now this is only another way of saying that they 
give us the manner in which a ceitain thing is 
done or a certain state occurs to say the aiin is 
shining cheerfully is to connect the predicate 
shining qualified by the word cheerfully with the 
subject sun but it is also to make the statement 
that the object called svn does a certain act i e the 
act of shining in a certain manner i e cheer 
fully he might have done it differently i e the 
svn might have shone dully or faintly in like 
manner to say am rather tired is to say that 
the person who speaks am or is in a certain 
state i e the state expressed by the word tired 
but might be very tired in which case the 
predicate tired would have been qualified by a 
different word from rather but still by a word of 
the same dass 

now the words of this class are numerous and 
they fall into divisions and subdivisions and 
this is no more than what we expect from the 
word manner which is a word of wide significa 
tion there are many manners in which a thing 
may be done it may be done slowly quickly

rather or very or eocceedingly tired 

then there are the words denoting tvme and place 
for it is clear that an action done in one place or 
at one time differs from an action done elsewhere 
and at another we may perhaps say that it 
differs in the mxinner of its doing for though the 
two actions when taken by themselves may be 
alike the circumstances under which they occur 
constitute a difference of no small importance 
this gives us words like here and there and also 
words like now and thefn 

other examples may be given but they wiu 
probably suggest themselves spontaneously they 
are by no means either few or rare they have 
what may be called their futiction which is to 
qualify or modify the meaning of words like 
bright tired shvrwng c and now — 

observe the word modify it is derived from 
modus a mode or mammer from modus the 
latin language derived the word modalas from 
which grammarians and logicians get the term 
tnodal z in mode or mcmner of a thing 

all the words belonging to the present class are 
more or less modal in their ftmction 

 words like of with through c still stand 
over for notice the dass that they form though 
important is small it consists chiefly of the fol 
lowing words— fty from in out near through

with it one of the most important words in all 
logic is a word which makes no part of a term no 
part of a copula no part of a proposition at all it 
is extraterminal so to say— extracopular— extra 
propositional it comes between two propositions 
but belongs to neither it is part of the masonry 
of logic but it is neither brick nor scaffolding it 
is the cement or mortar the word in question is 
therefore there are other words like it but if 
we understand the import of the word therefore 
we shall understand the basis and foundation of 
the science of formal logic 

 frame a universal proposition and let it be 
aflsrmative — all swans are white 

 fix your attention on its subject — swans 

 frame a second proposition which shall also 
be affirmative but not universal let it be par 
ticular 

 let the predicate of this second proposition 
be the same as the subject of the first —

swans 

 out of these two propositions make a third 
there is no difficulty in doing it it will be as 
follows —

preceded and select the proper word for expressing 
it this will be therefore

and be deduced from the statements of the first

pressed by the word therefore the first example 
of a peculiar class of words viz words that enter 
into language without entering into propositions 

they enter into language without entering into 
propositions nevertheless they are anything but 
independent of them on the contrary they have 
in one sense more to do with them tljan even 
words like mom bright and shitie words like 
man bright and shine can exist where there is

sketch of the structure of the ordinary syllogism — 
its mechanism 

a combination of three propositions the third 
of which is connected with the other two by means 
of the word therefore is called a syllogism and 
with the structure of the syllogism the province of 
the logician begins — the province of the logician aa 
distinguished from that of the grammarian the 
latter deals with single propositions and with pro 
positions in pairs the former with propositions in 
threes or tpads if we may borrow an expression 
from the welsh antiquarians 

if he strictly limit himself to his own subject 
the grammarian will have nothing to say to syl 
logisms however in the present work we have

propositions 

said so much about terms that we will utilize our 
familiarity with them carry our observations a 
little fiirther and although wide of our mark 
direct our attention to a point of proper logic 

our first analysis of the syllogism will be that 
of a watchmaker who in explaining the mechanism 
of a watch is satisfied in the first instance at least 
with taking one to pieces numbering the several 
parts of which it consists and naming them the 
principles of his art he reserves for a second di 
vision of his subject 

a syllogism then consists of three propositions 
the third of which is connected with the other 
two by means of the word therefore and 
this alone is sufficient to suggest the nature of 
the proposition thus connected and through it of 
the syllogism altogether it suggests that it is a 
form of reasonvng something has gone before 
and therefore something else will come after it 

of the three propositions that constitute a syllo 
gism the third is called the cotwlusion the other 
two the premises 

so much for the number and names of the three 
propositions that constitute a syllogism 

next follows the question as to the number of 
its terms how many of these are there in 
one sense there are six in another only three 
there are six because each proposition contains 
two a subject and a predicate there are six 
because x there could not be fewer 

but it by no means follows that because there 
are six terms altogether in a proposition there 
should be six different ones one or more of 
them may be repeated the subject of one propo

sition may be the predicate of another as is the 
case with the following pair of sentences — 

mem is mortal 
socrates is a man 

and with innumerable others 

now the real number of the different terms of 
a proposition is three so that our formula is three 
aad three — three propositions and three terms 
each term appearing twice — three propositions — 
three pairs of terms 

so now we see why the number of terms in a 
syllogism is in one sense six in another three 
there are six if we look to the whole number of 
predicates and subjects three if we look only to 
the different words that constitute them 

all men are mortal r 

c x premwe 

socrates is a man j 

therefore 

socrates is a mortal — conchision 

in this conclusion socrates is the subject mortal 
the predicate 

it is absolutely necessary to the structure of the 
syllogism that the terms of the conclusion must 
previously have appeared in the premises how 
could it be otherwise when each term has to be 
taken twice 

but this is not all the two premises have to be 
distinguished from one another if so they require 
to be named 

now the names for the premises are obtained 
from the names of the terms of the conclusion the

predicate of the conclusion being called the major 
term the subject of the conclusion the tninor 

each of these not only as has been already 
stated appears in the premises generally but in dif 
ferent and specific parts of them ie one appears 
in their first the other in their second proposition 
and this is only another way of saying that of the 
two premises in a syllogism one must contain the 
subject the other the predicate of the conclusion 
unless this be the case there is no syllogism at all 

the premiss that contains the predicate of the 
conclusion is called the major premiss the predicate 
of the conclusion having been called the tnajor 
term 

the premiss that contains the subject of the 
conclusion is called the minor premiss the subject 
of the conclusion having been called the minor 
term hence— 

a premiss often takes its name firom the name 
of the term it includes and major terms make 
major premises and vice versa 

major — all men are mortal 
minor — john is a man 

therefore 
conclusion — john is mortal 

barbara 

here mortal the predicate of the conclusion is 
the subject of the mijor premiss as well 

john the subject of the conclusion is also the 
subject of the minor

need not be noticed at present they are explained in §

but what is the third term mem which has no 
place in the conclusion at all 

this will be considered after the order of our 
three propositions has been examined 

in the examples jiist given the major preceded 
the mirior and the minor the conclusion was 
this necessary no the minor might have come 
first 

john is a man 
all men are mortal 

therefore 
john is mortal — barbara 

more than this substitute because for therefore 
and the conclusion might have come first i e we 
might have begun with the end 

john is mortal 
because 
john is a man and 
all men are mortal 
or 

john is mortal 

because 
all men are mortal and 
john is a man 

it is a matter of custom however to use there 
fore instead of because and in accordance there 
with to write the mxijor first and the conclusion 
last the minor coming between it is only how 
ever a matter of custom 

and now we may ask the name of the third 
term mxjin the term that has no place in tte con

it is called the middle term and a very im 
portant term it is it is called middle because 
it is neither the greater like the mjor nor the 
smaller like the minor it appears in the minor 
premiss and as the minor premiss is between the 
major and the conclusion its place in the syllogism 
looks like a reason for the name middle it is 
however only an apparent the other being the true 
one besides this the middle term is not limited 
to the middle proposition but occurs in the first 
as well — 

 all mn middle term being the subject are 
mortal 

 socrates is a man middle term beimg the pre 
dioat 

itierefore 

 socrates is mortal no middle term at au 

a middle term in the conclusion either as sub 
ject or predicate is a logical impossibility as the 
very terms major and minor exclude it a major 
is a major because it is one term of the conclusion 
and a minor is a minor because it is the other 
now there is no third term at all and hence a 
middle term in the conclusion of a proposition is a 
contradiction in terms 

a middle term then takes its name fiom the 
fact of its being intermediate to its greater and 
lesser fellows or coterms its major on one side 
and its minor on the other but what sort of an 
explanation is this is it not an instance of the 
obscurum per obscurius what are majors that 
they should be made much of and called great 
what are mimors that they should be made little 
of and called small whence the idea of size

no animal is immortal

it is probable however that the phraseology of the 
aflsrmatives has been extended to them 

pretniss is derived from the latin word prcb 
tnisaus sent before wherein prce before and 
missus sent its application to the major and 
minor premises of a syllogism is clear and appro 
priate these are the forerunners heralds or 
vauntcouriers of the conclusion but what are we 
to say to some of its secondary applications as 
they appear in the language of common life amongst 
surveyors beershopkeepers and legislators who talk 
of the premises of a house and of beer that may 
or may not be drunk upon such premises strange 
divergence of a meaning a word that originally 
meant sent before now means something upon 
which a man either consumes malt liquor or founds 
the conclusion of a syllogism strange but not 
stranger than many hundred others 

more important than such a question as this is 
the fact that the words conclusion and premiss are 
essentially relational terms as much so as husband 
and wife parent and child sovereign and subject 
c where there is no conclusion there is no pre 
miss and there is no premiss where a conclusion is 
wanting the one leads to the other fouows from 
the other a premiss without a conclusion is a 
road leading to nowhere and that is no road at 
all a conclusion without a premiss is an effect 
without a cause i e no effect whatever 

such is the fact though common language dis 
guises it common language often leads us to say

that such and such conclusions are false so they 
may be as matters of fact or as propositions but 
not as matters of logic or as conclusions they 
may be false as matters of fact because the pre 
mises from which they are deduced are false and 
this is the case with such a statement as no swan 
is blackj supposing it to be deduced from — 

no bird with webfeet is black 
swans have webfeet 
swans are not black

it is false because the premises are false as a de 
duction from the premises it is true and would 
have been true as a matter of zoology if they 
had been so but they were not on the other 
hand — 

some webfooted birds are black 

swans are webfooted 

some swans are black 

gives us a true piece of ornithology but a bad piece 
of logic in other words the proposition as a 
proposition is true as a conclusion false 

a conclusion is a conclusion because it follows 
from its premises and premises are premises be 
cause they lead to their conclusion the terms being 
relative a false conclusion is in reality a loose 
and inaccurate name for noconclusion premises

tion of propositions — mood 

§ we shall now find it convenient to depart 
pretty widely from the language of the first sections 
of this treatise and to adapt our phraseology to 
our new department which has ceased for a 
while to be that of the grammarian rather than the 
logician and begins to be that of the logician rather 
than the grammarian we shall find it i say 
convenient to change our phraseology but never 
theless the things we talk about will be the 
same as before we have stul under notice 
subjects and predicates terms copulas which con 
nect them and statements assertions declarations 
or propositions terms and propositions — propo 
sitions and terms — it is stul the old song though 
to a somewhat altered tune it is still the same 
series of pictures though we examine them from 
another point of view 

it is now convenient to talk less of propositions 
simiply as such than of propositions in their cha 
racter of premiss or conclusion it is convenient 
in short to talk of conclusions and premises the 
premises being either majors or minois 

in like manner it is also convenient to talk less 
of terms simply as such than of terms in their 
characters of major minor and middle at any 
rate we must fix our attention steadily on these 
five words — conclusion premiss middle term major 
and minor we must remember too that major 
and minor are the names of certain propositions as 
well as the names of certain terms

 propositions 

the first analysis of the syllogism is into its 
conclusion and premises the premises being either 
major or minor each of the three being a proposi 
tion of some kind or other the conclusion being a 
proposition the major premiss being a proposition 
the minor premiss being a proposition — three propo 
sitions in all but propositions are of four kinds — 

 universal affirmative 

 universal negative 

 particular affirmative 

 particular negative 

as has been shown in § and any one of these 
four kinds may constitute any one of the parts of 
a syllogism thus — 

a the major premiss may be one of four things 
viz universal affirmative universal negative parti 
cular affirmative or particular negative it may 
be any one of these and cannot be anything else 

 the minor premiss may be one of four things 
viz universal affirmative c 

c the conclusion may be one of four things 
c 

to proceed — the conclusion may be the same as 
one of the premises eg say that it is the same as 
the minor and that they are both universal affirma 
tives we then have one universal affirmative fol 
lowed by another 

again — the minor may be the same as the major 
say that both are universal affirmatives and the 
conclusion being the same as the minor we have 
then three universal affirmatives running this is 
neither more or less than saying that all the three 
propositions of a syllogism are of the same sort 
ie universal and affirmative affirmative and uni

versa in such a case the order of the proposi 
tion would be — 

major — universal afltanative 

minor — universal affirmative 

conclusion — universal affirmative 

there are plenty of syllogisms of this kind 
eg— 

all men are mortal 
all heroes are men 
therefore 
all heroes are mortal — barbara 

contrast with this — 

no men are immortal 
all heroes are men 
therefore 
no heroes are immortal — gelarent 

what is the order here the following — 

major — universal negative 
minor — universal affirmative 
conclusion — universal negative 

again as a third combination consisting of a 
universal affirmative followed by two particular 
ones take — 

all men are mortal 
some heroes are men 

therefore 
some heroes are mortal — jdarii 

here the order which we may as well express 
somewhat more compendiously than has hitherto 
been done is u a — p a — p a the words

major minor and conclusion being omitted and 
the initials standing for the whole word viz — 
u a for universal affirmative 
p a for particular aflsrmative 

to these add — 

u n for universal negative 
p n for particular negative 

hence a fourth combination — 
no badman is happy 
some heroes are badmen 

therefore 
some heroes are not happy 

ferio 
may be read off thus— tt n— p a— p n 
or — 

major — u n or un ng 
minor — p a or pa aff 
goncludon — p n or pa ng 

there is some advantage as will appear in the 
sequel in writing the order in which the proposi 
tions of a syllogism follow each other vertically or 
from top to bottom rather than horizontally or 
from side to side 

the order in which the propositions of a syllo 
gism follow each other is called the mood of the 
syllogism 

enough has now been said respecting the dif 
ferent combinations of the different sorts of pro 
positions that constitute the conclusions and pre 
mises of syllogisms the subject is by no means 
exhausted indeed it is only touched all that is

the combinations effected through the difference 
between aflsrmatives and negatives universals and

the structvre of propositions is another and this 
we are now about to notice 

they are both questions of order or sequence

let us now treat the two together briefly and 
as an illustration rather than a uu exposition of

in doing this it will suffice to select two pairs 
out of the foregoing syllogism and to contrast them 
with one another 

first pair 

 

a all men are mortal 
a all heroes are men 
a all heroes are mortal — barbara 

 
e no man is immortal 
a all heroes are men 
e no hero is immortal — celarent 

these considered as combinations of propositions 
and terms run thus —

a or universal affirmative minor major

here the order of the terms is the same the 
order of the propositions being different a fact 
which the next pair of examples will reverse 

second paie

a all heroes are men 

e no hero is immortal — celarent 

 

e no bird is ananimalthatbringsforthits

a every bat is ananimalthatbringsforthits

here the combination of the terms differs the

structure of the ordinary syllogism — white — 
socrates — some 

this is a convenient place for noticing three 
points of logical language which if neglected may 
strike the reader at some future time as having been 
insufficiently explained 

i white and words like white— these are 
the words that can by themselves constitute predi 
cates but which cannot by themselves constitute 
subjects as — 

all swans are white 

the grammarian has good reasons for denying 
that words of this kind are names he allows 
whiteness to be a name whitething also he 
allows to be a name but not the simple word 
white he allows however that it is a word 
which suggests and implies a name and that by 
adding to it the word thing object entity bevng 
or some equivalent word capable of forming a sub 
ject it may be converted into a name finally 
he admits that this conversion is easy and in logic 
always legitimate 

now this reduction of words capable of form 
ing predicates only into words capable of forming 
predicates and subjects as well which the gramma 
rian allows to the logician the logician finds abso 
lutely necessary 

all swans are white 

but 
all white are not swans

propositions 

we must fill up the blank here by bird animaly 
thing object eruity c as the case may be 
hence — 

 whitething is an actual name a name in 
esse whilst — 

 white a word implying a name is a name 
in posse 

between these two the grammarian draws a 
difference the logician treats them both alike 
both as actual names white in logic is a name 
and in logic a term must be a tvarae 

in grammar a term must be either a tiame or a 
word that itaplies a tiame 

this will be noticed more fully in the sequel 

ii socrates and words like socrates — these 
john peter julius caesar c are names for single 
individuals as such they wear the appearance of 
being particular rather than universal terms 

if for instance 

some men are mortal 

be a particular proposition surely — 

socrates is mortal 

is particular as weu inasmuch as socrates is 
only one man he is only ons out of some a 
part of a part a fraction of a fraction an indivi 
dual out of a collection the collection itself being 
but part of another and a larger one 

nevertheless socrates and terms like socrates 
are not particular but universal the fact being 
that when we say that socrates john peter julius 
gcbsar c is mortal man philosopher c we 
mean not so much the particular individual as a 
class of individuals whom socrates john c re

presents but classes may be either great or small 
they may consist of a million million millici of 
individuals or of only one 

now the class that is represented by names like 
socrates john c is a class consisting of a single 
member as a class however it is imbroken in 
such propositions as 

socrates is mortal 

which give it in full and not in parts 

iii some — in common conversation the speaker 
who says that some swans are white implies that 
there are others which are nxt white and in like 
manner the statement that some swcms are not 
white implies that some are in other words the 
affirmation of a part implies the denial of the re 
mainder and vice versa the denial of part implies 
the affirmation of the remainder but in logic 
this is not the case in logic every proposition 
means exactly what it states and implies nothing 
beyond it in logic a man may say that some 
swans are white and by no means suggest the 
notion that they are not azl so this may or 
may not be the case if azl swans are white it is 
selfevident that some of them are if some 
swans are white all swans tnay be so 

soms then in logic may mean the same as all 
or every a meaning which in common speech it 
has not 

some in logic means more than none — i e tnore

structure of the ordinary syllogism — quantity 
or extent of the predicate 

the care that is taken by the logicians that 
the word some should not by implying as it does 
in common conversation something more than it 
actually expresses mean too much has just been 
noticed through it we attain no doubt a certain 
amount of caution and accuracy of thought to 
say neither more nor less than we mean and to 
mean neither less nor more than we say is 
only what is right and proper be it so the 
accuracy however in question is limited to one of 
the members of the proposition it is only in the 
subject that it shows itself the predicate being by 
no means well furnished with signs of its quantity 
or extent 

mark the blank in the following syllogism — 

all men will die 

all men are rational beings 

therefore 
— rational beings will die 

mark the blank and ask what is required to 
fill it up it must be one of three words — no all 
or sorrhe that it cannot he tvo is evident on the 
contrary it must be either all or sotyie which of 
these two words is the right one remains to be in 
vestigated and this investigation must be limited 
to the syllogism itself we are not allowed to 
argue from the rationality of immortal spirits that 
only ne of the beings endowed with reason will

die and as little are we free to limit the domain 
of rational beings to the earth upon which we 
dwell and on the strength of au the ratioiial beings 
of the world of man being liable to death to 
assume that all will die we are precluded from 
all reasoning of this kind precluded from it be 
cause our field of inquiry is limited to the syllogism 
itself 

in examining this the first step is to remark 
that the term rational beings in the subject of the 
conclusion is neither more nor less than the rational 
beings which stood as predicate in the minor premiss 
what is it then universal or particular is it 
all men are all rational beiifigs or oil men are 
some rational bemgs by which is meant do men 
constitute the whole of the class of rational beings 
or do they constitute only a part of it the 
answer to this must be got at as we best can it is 
transparently evident that it is not givenin the 
wording of the proposition the subject men was 
preceded by all but what precedes the predicate 
rational being nothing as far as words go 
the whole of the class may as easily be meant as a 
part of it and vice versa now — 

a subject that has previously been a predicate 
retains its predicative qvxintity 

but this as long as it was the quantity of a 
predicate was a matter of inference only no sign 
expressed it hence — 

wherever there is a subject in a later which 
has stood as the predicate in a former proposition 
the sign of its qvxintity has to be inferred 

the rules for doing this are simple and we 
arrive at them from the quality of the proposition 



digitized by 



google 



propositions 

in which the terms occur — from its quality not its 
qvxatity from its character as affirmative or nega 
tive rather than from its character as universal or 
particular 

the quantity helps us but little — 

au swans are white 

admit this to be true and it will by no means 
follow that — 

au whitethings are swans 

however much some whitethings may be so 
this gives us the rule that — 

 universal affirmatives have particular predi 
cates on the other hand — 

 with imiversal negatives the predicates are 
universal to say that— 

no horse is a bird 

is to say that — 

no bird is a horse 

 the predicates of particulars are of the same 
extent as their subjects hence as the general 
rule — 

 affirmative propositions have particular ne 
gative either universal or particular predicates

if all toen are mortal it stands to reason that 
some rnen must be so the two propositions 
however differ some men may be mortal without 
au being so 

the two propositions differ the one being parti 
cvzar the other universal 

to change a proposition from universal to parti 
cular is to weaken to change one from particular to 
universal is to strengthen it 

now a universal conclusion from particular propo 
sitions is a conclusion too strong for its premises 
or rather it is a conclusion for which the premises 
are too weak or rather it is no conclusion at all 



 

operations on the ordinary syllogism — conversion 
and reduction 

§ to change the order of the terms of a propo 
sition is to change the predicate into the subject 
and vice versa this is called conversion 

simple conversion occurs where we transpose 
both the term itself and the sign of its quantity 
i e we change their places without making any 
further alteration or as the sign of its quantity 
is a part and parcel of the term itself we have an 
instance of simple conversion where we transpose 
the terms altogether this we do with such pro 
positions as — 

no horse is a bird 

which is the same as

and with 

some quadrupeds are horses 
which is the same as 

some horses are quadrupeds 
with 

all horses are quadrupeds 
the case is different here the conversion into 

all quadrupeds are horses 
is incorrect 

change however all into some and the conver 
sion is legitimate for — 

all horses are quadrupeds 

avd 
some quadrupeds are horses 

this however is something more than simple con 
version it is conversion accompanied with weak 
ening 

it is obvious that by conversion we may change 
the mood and figure of the proposition converted 
this is called reduction

enclose all living men in a large triangle and all respiring 
ohjects in a large circle the preceding assertion if true 
would require that the whole of the triangle should be 
contained in the circle and in the same way we may 
reduce any assertion to the expression of a coincidence 
total or partial between two figures thus a point in a 
circle may represent an individual of one species and a 
point in a triangle an individual of another species and 
we express the whole of one species as asserted to be con

may be called the formal character of the syllogism 
by which is meant the fact of the conclusion being 
deduced from its relation to its premises rather 
than the accuracy as matters of ct of the pre

such being the case we are prepared to find in 
logic what we find in algebra viz the symbolic 
representation of the parts of propositions by 
means of letters — a representation that the gene 
rality of the processes of syllogistic reasoning 
favours and suggests 

extract 

 when we say that all men will die and that all men 
are rational beings and thence infer that some rational 
beings will die the logical truth of this sentence is the same 
whether it be true or false that men are mortal and 
rational this logical truth depends upon the structure 
of the sentence and not upon the particular matters spoken 
of thus 

instead of write 

all men will die every y is x 

all men are rational beings every y is z 

therefore some rational therefore some zs are xs 
beings will die 

the second of these is the same proposition logically con 
sidered and rightly inferred from the premises whether 
the premises be true or false is not a question of logic but 
of morals philosophy history or any other sort of know

should this leap from a particular instance to a

stead of it the same amount of change by instal

every y is mortal 

every y is a rational being

the elk has horns on the head therefore the elk is rumi

siveness or soundness of the argument does not at all 
depend on our conviction of the truth of either of the pre 
mises or even on our understanding the meaning of 
them for if we substitute for one of the things we are 
speaking about some unmeaning symbol such as a letter 
of the alphabet which may stand for anything that may 
be agreed on the reasoning remains the same for in 
stance suppose we say instead of animal that has boms on 
the head every x is ruminant the elk isx there 
fore the elk is ruminant the argument is equally valid

 and again instead of the word ruminant let us put 
the letter y then the argument every x is y the 
elk is x therefore the elk is y would be a valid argu 
ment as before 

 and the same would be the case if you were to put 
 z for the elk for the syllogism every x is y z is 
x therefore z is y is completely valid whatever you 
suppose the symbols x y and z to stand for 

 any one may try the experiment by substituting for 
x y and z respectively any words he pleases and he 
will find that if he does but preserve the same form of 
expression it will be impossible to admit the truth of the 
premises without admitting abo the truth of the conclu 
sion — whatelt jjogic i § 

observe how decidedly both authors insist on 
the unimportance of the accuracy or inaccuracy 
of the propositions as taken by themselves and 
how thoroughly they admit nothing as essential to 
the conclusion but its relation to the premises and 
their rdcuion to each other observe how tho 
roughly they make the form rather than the sub 
stance of the proposition the allimportant and 
fundamontal element of the syllogism yet it is not 
because they or any other writers are indifferent to 
the actual truth of either the propositions of a 
syllogism or any other series of sentences it is 
only because logic is essentially a science of rela

 some men are mortal 

 socrates is a man 

 socrates is a mortal 

is a triad or leash of propositions all of which 
are true in respect to the facts they declare or 
affirm but are they true as premises and conclu 
sion are they premises and conclusions at all 
no it is only some men whom the first we 
cannot call it the majcxr proposition affirms to 
be mortal what if there be some who are not 
what if socrates be among them there may 
be only one in that predicament but what if 
socrates were he we know that he was tiot 
this we know too that there are no exceptions 
to the first statement we know that we might 
safely have said all instead of some nevertheless 
because we failed to do so we missed a syllogism 
though we stated truths enough to form one fiom 
on the other hand that — 

 ah horses are sixlegged 

 socrates is a horse 

 socrates is sixlegged 

is true as a syllogism though false as a series of pro 
positions and that in respect to each and all of the 
three however — 

to save our sense of prepositional or substantial 
truth fiom being shocked by this indifierence on 
the part of the syllogism let us insert —

before the minor proposition — and 

before the conclusion — then

in which case our former series of false asser 
tions runs — 

if 
all horses are sixlegged 

and 
socrates be a horse 

then 
socrates must he sixlegged 

the fact is that this indifference to truth on the 
part of the syllogism is practically in many cases 
an instrument in the investigation of truth there is 
many a premiss the accuracy or inaccuracy of which 
is doubtful as long as it is looked at alone see 
however what it leads to and you see its truth or 
falsehood 

finally it is this indifference to the matter of 
propositions that makes the symbolical expression of 
them possible 

the symbols themselves as we have seen are 
certain letters of the alphabet and until some 
reason is given for preferring one to another they 
are all equally convenient in the previous ex 
ample we wrote y is x man is mortal but we 
might have written h is y or a is b or b is a 
c 

there are reasons however in favour of a certain 
selection in x y z the order of the alphabet 
coincides with the order of the terms major x 
middle y and miifhor z which is an advantage 

they are better than a b c for another reason 
a is already used for another purpose a is one 
of four letters which are used to denote whole pro

the universal affirmative and e for the universal

every man is mortal every y x or a 
no man is mortal no y x or e 

 the two particulars follow — 

some men are mortal some y x or i 
some men are not mortal some yijfcx or o 

we doubtless felt the want of a notation of this 
kind in § when we wrote such formulae as uni 
versal affirmative universal negative c in full — 
totidem verbis et totidem uteris indeed it forced 
us upon the abbreviations u a xj n p a or 
p n c had we however used them to any 
great extent they would have failed both in com 
pendiousness and generality neither would they 
have had any value in any language where the 
equivalents to universal particular negative and 
affirmative began with letters other than a n p

no one need forget the mood of a syllogism for 
want of a mnemonic there are plenty of them 
as will be seen in the sequel 

but what if we want the figure as well this 
will be answered in the sequel also the object of 
the present section is to state the ct that some 
of the difficulties in the way of detail arising out 
of the combinations of a e i o are met by means 
of certain mnemonic words or words coined for 
the assistance of the memory the fiiller details 
of their application will constitute another notice 

at present it is sufficient to state that in 
barbara celarmt darii and feria 
the figure is the same viz — 

middle major or y z 
minor middle or x y 
minor major orz 

hence in symbols the previous examples run 
thus —

 logic is a formal science it takes no consideration 
of real existence or of its relations but is occupied solely 
about that existence and those relations which arise through 
and are regulated by the conditions of thought itself of 
the truth or falsehood of propositions in themselves it 
knows nothing and takes no account all in logic may be 
held true that is not conceived as contradictory in reason 
ing logic guarantees neither the premises nor the con 
clusion but merely the consequence of the latter from 
the former for a syllogism is nothing more than the ex 
plicit assertion of the truth of one proposition on the 
hypothesis of other propositions being true in which it is 
implicitly contained a conclusion may thus be true in

started with the largest mass of terms we had — 
viz the syllogism and of this we considered the 
propositions first for the syllogism contained the 
propositions the proposition the terms the syllo 
gism contained the premises and conclusion the 
premises and conclusion the majors middles and 
minors with these the ultimate elements we 
concluded this was to take the watch to pieces 

but we might have reversed the order of our 
operations and have begun with the term forming 
out of the terms the propositions and out of the 
propositions the syllogism had we done this the 
watch would have been put together our method 
having been synthetic 

neither synthesis nor analysis are words foreign 
to systematic works on logic and for this reason 
they have been noticed

 there are three operations of the mind which are im 
mediately concerned in argument — 

 ist simple apprehension 
nd judgment 
 rd discourse or reasoning 
 simple apprehension is the notion or conception of 
any object of the mind analogous to the perception of the

senses it is either incomplex or complex incomplex 
apprehension is of one object or of several without any 
relation being perceived between them as of a man a 
horsey cards complex is of several with such a relation as 
of a man on horsebacky a pack of cards 

 judgment is the comparing together in the mind two 
of the notions or ideas which are the objects of apprehen 
sion whether complex or incomplex and pronouncing that 
they agree or disagree with each other or that one of them 
belongs or does not belong to the other judgment there 
fore is either affirmative or negative 

 eeasoning or discourse is the act of proceeding 
from one judgment to another founded upon that one or 
the result of it 

 language affords the signs by which these operations 
of the mind are expressed and communicated 

 an act of apprehension expressed in language is called 
a term an act of judgment a proposition an act of reason

the syllogism itself is either analytic or sjmthe 
tic or rather the synthetic syllogism for the 
ordinary one with which we have hitherto dealt 
belongs to this division is capable of being put in 
an analytic form and this is what we have been 
led to anticipate for has it not been said that 
instead of beginning with our premises and ending 
with our conclusion and writing therefore between 
the last two propositions we might have begun 
with the conclusion and ended with the premises 
writing because between the first proposition and 
the second has it not been said that it is only in 
accordance with custom that we write —

press them along with which we have a notice of 
some of the operations in the way of strengthening 
converaionj c the symbolic notation along with 
the quality and quantity of propositions has not 
been neglected nor yet the value of the several 
terms the mnemonic manoeuvres for recollecting 
the differences of figure and mood have been alluded 
to lastly there has been an exhibition of cer 
tain material illustrations in the way of ciicles 
triangles and squares on one side and black and 
white lines on the other 

now these last will help us in what is now 
coming under notice viz the principle or rationale 
of the syllogism a question that has yet to be con 
sidered 

what is the leading or fundamental principle of 
the ordinary syllogism more especially how is it 
iuustrated by our squares and lines 

the triangles circles and squares shall be noticed 
first let us consider them as filled with points — 
these points standing for individual objects the 
figures themselves standing for classes as long as 
the triangle lies within the circle and the circle 
within the square the points contained in the 
triangle are contained in the square also common 
sense says this it is the kernel in the shell with 
the embryo of the future plant in the kernel it is 
the foot in the stocking with the stocking in the 
boot it is the blood in the artery with the artery 
in the body it is anything in short contained 
by anything else which something else contains 

it cannot but be in two things at once for 
what is in the nut is in the nutshell that contains 
the nut the part of a part is part of any whole

that contains that part socrates is part of the 
class of tnen and men part of the class of mortals 
what then must socrates be what can he be but 
mortal 

mutatis mutandis the same reasoning applies to 
negative propositions if the kernel lie outside the 
shell the embryo within the kernel must do the 
same hence — 

whatever is predicated ie affirmed or denied 
pniversally of any class of things may be predi 
cated in like manner viz affirmed or denied of 
anything comprehended in that class 

this is called the didwm de onvni et nvmo ie 
the rule concerning au cmd none

 in order to trace more distinctly the different steps of 
the abstracting process by which any particular argument 
may be brought into the most general form we may first 
take a syllogism ie an argument stated accurately and at 
full length such as the example formerly given whatever 
exhibits marks of design c and then somewhat gene 
ralise the expression by substituting as in algebra arbi 
trary unmeaning symbols for the significant tertiis that 
were originally used the syllogism will then stand thus 
 every b is a c is b therefore c is a the reasoning 
when thus stated is no less evidently valid whatever terms 
a b and c respectively may be supposed to stand for 
such terms may indeed be inserted as to make all or some 
of the assertions ozsd but it will be no less impossible for

propositions 

any one who admits the trnth of the premises in an argu 
ment thus constructed to deny the conclusion and this it 
is that constitutes the conclusiveness of an argument 

 viewing then the syuogism thus expressed it appears 
clearly that a stands for anything whatever that is 
aflbrmed of a certain entire class viz of every b which 
class comprehends or contains in it something else viz c 
of which b is in the second premiss aflsrmed and 
that consequently the first term a is in conclusion pre 
dicated of the third c 

 non to assert the validity of this process now before 
us is to state the very dictum we are treating of with 
hardly even a verbal alteration viz — 

 anything whatever predicated of a whole class 
 under which class something else is contained 
 may be predicated of that which is so contained 
 the three members into which the maxim is here dis 
tributed correspond to the three propositions of the syllo 
gism to which they are intended respectively to apply — 
whatelt logicy l § 

n 

 all ratiocination therefore starts from a general pro 
position principle or assumption a proposition in which a 
predicate is affirmed or denied of an entire class the 
other premiss asserts that something belongs to or is 
included in the class respecting which something was 
afirmed or denied in the nugor premiss 

 it follows that the attribute affirmed or denied of the 
entire class may if there was truth in that affirmation or 
denial be affirmed or denied of the object or objects alleged 
to be included in the class and this is precisely the asser 
tion made in the conclusion 

 whether or not the foregoing is an adequate account 
of the constituent parts of the syllogism will be pre 
sently considered but as £eu as it goes it is a true ac 
count it has accordingly been generalised and erected

into a logical maxim the maxim is that whatever can be

 if the mere perception and comparison of two ideas 
would always show us whether they agree or disagree 
then all rational propositions would be matters of intelli 
gence or first principles and there would be no use of 
reasoning or drawing any consequences it is the narrow 
ness of the human mind which introduces the necessity of 
reasoning when we are unable to judge of the truth or 
falsehood of a proposition in an immediate manner by the 
mere contemplation of its subject and predicate we are 
then constrained to use a medium and compare each of 
them with some third idea that by seeing how far they 
agree or disagree with it we may be able to judge how far 
they agree or disagree among themselves thus if there are 
two lines a and b and i know not whether they are equal 
or no i take a third line or an inch and apply it to each

of them if it agree with them both then i infer that 
a and b are equal but if it agree with one and not with 
the other then i conclude a and b are unequal if it agree 
with neither of them there can be no comparison 

 so if the question be whether god must be wor 
shipped we seek a third idea suppose the idea of a creator 
and say — 

 our creator must be worshipped 
god is our creator 
therefore god must be worshipped 

 the comparison of this third idea with the two dis 
tinct parts of the questions usually requires two proposi 
tions which are called the premises the third proposition 
which is drawn from them is the conclusion — watts

rationale of the ordmary syuogism — its terms 
viewed as eocpressive of the coexistence of 
certain attributes 

take from euclid the axiom that — 

 things which are equal to the same thing are equal to 
one another 

instead of equal to write coeodsts with so that 
the axiom run — 

things which coeodst with the same thing 
coeodst with one another 

this is the form in mills logic a form which is 
illustrated by the rule rather than classwiew by 
 rather than a o and d 

nor are there wanting reasons notwithstanding the 
historical importance of the dictum de omni et 
nuuo for preferring the former to the latter

things y then which eoexist with the sarnie thing 
coeodst with one another such is the principle of 
the affirmative syllogism that of the negative 
being that — 

a thing which coexists with another thing with 
which other a third thing does not coadst is not 
coeodstent with that third thing 

by coexistence is meant existence in the same 
object or class of objects by things the auributes 
or qualities of such object 

in the first proposition of the syllogism — 
all men are mortal 
all heroes are men 
all heroes are mortal 
the import is that wherever there is the attrihwte 
of manhood there is the attribute of mortality also 
the coexistence as shown in the wording of the 
proposition being as follows — 

in all cases of minhood there is a ooexistent 
mortality 

in soms cases of wjoriality there is a coexistent 
manhood it may be that there is in all the 
proposition however only states that it is so in some 
all men are mortal objects conversely some 
mxyrtal objects are men 

wherever there is either mxmhood or myrtality 
there may be other attributes as well of these the 
first of our three propositions takes no notice thus 
with tnanhood there may be heroism cowardice 
virtue vice all of which if they coexist with some 
manhood and if all manhood coexist with some 
mxyrtality must so fer as they coexist with that 
manhood also coexist with its coexisting mor 
tality

but as has already been stated our first propo 
sition the only one under immediate notice tells us 
nothing about them it is only the second that 
does anything for us in this respect 

it is the second or the rnvnor that teus us that — 
all heroes are mer 
by which is meant that all the attributes that con 
stitute our idea of a hero coexist with some marv 
hood all heroes being men though all men are 
not heroes 

but all manhood whatsoever consists with mor 
tazityy in other words there is none of the former 
without some of the latter 

hence — all the herohood that coexists with the 
mcmhood coexists with the mortality y with which 
the manhood coexists

let us keep our attention on its middle term ie 
on the word mom 

it is essentially a mem to cm end — nothing 
more as the name of a class it contains such 
contents as it has solely for the purpose of enabling 
them to be placed in some other class as a rule 
or measure it is thrown aside when it has effected 
its measurement under such conditions how can 
it show itself in the conclusion the conclusion 
contains nothing but results — the equalities or co 
existences that the rule or survey determined — the 
individuab that the smaller class gave to the larger 
one the middle term then cannot but be absent 
from the conclusion 

but this is only another way of saying its 
necessity being supposed to be proved that it must 
appear in the premises and this is what it inva 
riably does 

it must appear in the premises not only once 
but twice 

it must appear in the premises twt only twice 
but each appearance must be made in a different 
proposition — ie one in the major and one in the 
minor 

if it wfere not so we could have none of the 
necessary comparisons to predicate of mortal 
that it is anything except mortal requires two dif 
ferent terms to the proposition moiial is mortal 
being a useless truism but of these two different 
terms one must be a new one ie different from 
those of the conclusion if not we only get the con 
clusion repeated with or without variations eg — 
heroes alv are mortals 
mortals some are heroes

there is nothing of much use in this 

so much for the place of the middle term in one 
of the premises how does it show itself in the 
other the minor term heroes we have ready to 
our hand but this we cannot repeat that 
were to construct a truism e g 
heroes are heroes 

nor yet can we attach the major morta to it 
that were to repeat the conclusion 

nor yet can we bring in a wholly fresh word 
that were to abolish the comparison altogether 
man mortal 
hero migdy 
what can follow from this nothing 

the only second term that we can introduce is 
the middle term which we may now say has been 
shown to be — 

 repeated 

 appearing each time in a different proposi 
tion 

 neither of those propositions being the con 
clusion but on the contrary the premises and 
nothing but the premises 

if this exposition appear somewhat mechanical 
as it really is let it be suggested that the positions 
for the middle term which it illustrates are of great 
importance and that it is to give these positions 
simply as details of structure fiiu prominence 
rather than to exhibit the disposition of the terms 
of a syllogism in a general and scientific manner

the place of the middle term m the several figures 
— the figures four in number 

§ let us still keep the middle term in our minds 
even though at the commencement of our forth 
coming notices it occupies no very prominent 
position it will appear towards the end of 
them 

the order of the terms of a syllogism has been 
already considered § 

it has also been stated that a difference in the 
arrangement constitutes a difference of figure 

how many of these arrangements i e how many 
syllogistic figures are there that depends upon 
what we mean by figure the number of combi 
nations and permutations capable of being effected 
by ringing changes on the one major me minor 
and two middles the terms of the premises of a 
syllogism is a matter of arithmetia they are 
limited and definite and can be ascertained d priori 
the number of combinations and permutations that 
are available for the purposes of syllogistic reason 
ing is a special matter of lc one is one thing 
the other another they may or may not agree 
au the combinations of major and maddle middle 
and minor may be lcal or only some of them 
may be so hence figure may mean all the com 
binations of major maddle c that can be effected 
or it may mean only those that contribute to the 
formation of conclusions the former gives us the 
possible or arithmetical the latter the ojctudl or 
logical forms 

such is the preliminary distinction how does it

apply at the present moment it is no distinction 
at all at the present moment and ever since the 
time of gralen all the arithmetical combinations 
are also one and all logical between however 
the time of qalen and aristotle there was one of 
them which seemed to lead to no conclusion at all 
ie to be extralogical that this was only appa 
rent and that it was a real logical figure is said 
to have been discovered by the philosophers just 
named 

the distinction then in question between the 
logical and arithmetical combination of the terms of 
a syllogism is historical rather than scientific as 
such we have noticed it we have noticed it also 
for a reason which wiu appear in the sequel 

to proceed however to our present details — the 
number of figures is four the full arithmetical 
number we can ascertain them d priori there 
are two possible changes for the major proposition 
and two for the minor — two for each and no more 
than two

follows from the formal character of the science of 
logic its truths arise from relations as such they 
are necessary and in necessary truths there are no 



but are they all equally clear 

the answer to this has been already suggested 
the first three are said to have been discovered 
some three hundred years before the fourth which 
certainly looks as if they were not 

are they au equally direct ie do they all come 
under the immediate application of the dictvm de 
omni et nullo or its equivalents the extent to 
which they do this has doubtless something to do 
with their clearness but it is a question which 
may stand over for a while 

what now claims our attention is the fact that — 

the four figures are only so many names for so 
many places for the middle term 

 in the first — the middle term is subject in 
the major and predicate in the minor premiss 

 in the second — predicate in both 

 in the third — subject in both 

 in the fourth — predicate in the major sub 
ject in the minor 

should it be easier for us to remember numbers 
than names we may say that — 

in the first figure the middle term is in and 
ie that it is in the first and third places of the 
syllogism or we say that it is by 

in the second it is and or by 

in the third and or by 

in the fourth and or by 

in the other places we have of course one of the 
other two terms — the major in the major the minor

place of the middle term we also know that of the

 if the middle be in and the major mudt

 if the middle be in and the major must

the moods — mood and figure — a real and

let us stiu keep the middle term in our minds 
c 

the order of the propositions of a syllogism has 
been already considered § 

it has also been stated that a differenee in the 
arrangement constitutes a difference of mood 

how many of these arrangements ie how many 
syllogistic moods are there 

that depends on what we mean by tnood 

all this and more might be added is what we

priaris the first aecundce the second tertia the 
third and quarta the fowrth we must understand 
or supply ura or fivrce z figure 

but the consonants — what is their function 
have they any may they not be merely arbitrary 

let us first ask what there is that they ccm 
teach us ie what there is beyond the two fiwts of 
mood and figure which we have already been 
taught de morgan calls the mnemonics under 
notice magic words — words which i take to be 
more full of meaning than any that were ever 
made — formal logic p now words of 
this kind should speak through their every letter — 
consonants as well as vowels and so they do 
they speak to the phenomena of conversion and 
reduction telling us what sort of conversions are 
effected ie whether they are simple or accompa 
nied by weakening or strengthening they tell us 
too to what forms others are reduced it is not 
for nothing that cesare begins with the same letter 
as celarent and dairyi and darapti with d ob 
serve too how baroko c begins like barbara and 
felapton like ferio 

whatever may be the case with the remainder 
none of the consonants at the heginwmg of the 
words are arbitrary on the contrary they con 
nect the words to which they stand as initials 
with each other eg cesare with celarent and that 
for the purposes of reduction cesare when reduced 
is reduced to celarent 

with the exception of the initials however all 
the other consonants of the first line are arbitrary

to these from the fourth line the d in bokardo which 
unlike the d in darii dimaris dcuid c fiiu of

use then of b and d when not initial as weu as 
of i thy and t is to improve the shape and sound 
of the words in which they occur they gene 
rally improve the sound and sometimes help the

the remaining four — m s p and h are never 
used indifferently hence in disamia and fesapo 
every letter has not only its use but its meaning 
also in disarms we learn from 

d that the syllogism is reducible to daru from 

i a i that its premises are particular affirmative 
and universal affirmative followed by a particular 
affirmative conclusion from 

s that the major premiss denoted by i requires 
in order to effect its reduction that its terms should 
be transposed from 

m that the minor premiss expressed by a and 
the conclusion expressed by i must be transposed 
and finally from the second 

s that the terms of the conclusion must be 
transposed 

in like manner esapo says that the conversion 
must be to erio and that the major premiss must 
have its terms transposed but what is the mean 
ing o p it is a new letter and requires expla 
nation it means as much as s and something 
more it means not only that the terms of the

that their signs are to be changed as well it 
means for instance that such a proposition as all 
men are mortal is to be be converted not into 

all mortals are men 

which is illegitimate but into 

some mortals are men 

k still remains to be explained it means that 
baroko and bokardo must be reduced by a pecu 
kar process a process which in a sketch like the 
present finds no place 

all the significant noninitial consonants then 
express conversion and reduction 

s expresses conversion in its simplest form and 
doubtless stands for sitnplex simplex conversion 
or conversio simplex 

p which denotes conversion accompanied by 
either strengthening or weakening is the first letter 
of per acddetis the technical name for conversions 
of this kind 

m as i imagine mutatio change and denotes 
the conversion or transposition of propositions — 
not merely of terms but of whole combinations of 
terms premises and even conclusions 

k perhaps i have not the knowledge that enables 
me to speak with confidence is used for the ex

fact of its being but half a latin letter — an ex

here — 
mortals the major which contams 
men or the middle which though contained by 
mortals corvtaviis 
heroes or the mmor contained by both 

viewed in respect to the collection of mortaza 
the collection of men is coruavned 

viewed in respect to the collection of heroes the 
collection of m£n is containing 

such are the relations of the middle term as the 
name of a class contained and containing being 
the words that express them 

when the middle term is containing and con 
tained it is both really middle and rationally 
middle ie it is what its name denotes and that 
without disturbing the names of either of its two 
associated terms — major and minor 

how far this is the case with the other three 
figures remains to be seen how far the dictum 
de omni et nullo applies directly to the other figures 
remains to be seen also that it applies directly 
enough to figure i is obvious

propositions 

only some mortals are mn this has been stated 
more than once before and that explicitly but 
certain deductions from it have not been so ex 
plicitly stated some and au have different mag 
nitudes according to the term to which they are 
attached with a predicate they mean one thing 
with a subject another 

to say all men are mortal is to say some men 
are mortal — this and something more it is to 
say that if all mn are tnortal some men are so 
d fortiori the greater includes the smaller the 
whole the parts but these powers of all and 
some are only found when they apply to the same 
word when we come to such expressions as 
man is mortal their import changes 

when one thing is affirmed of another the predi 
cate gives the larger the subject the smaller class of 
objects a collection consisting of all the men in 
the world makes but a part of the collection of all 
its mottals or mortal beings 

hence particular predicates contain universal 
subjects this being but another way of say 
ing that the whole of a smaller class is no more 
than the part of a larger one in other words sub 
jects as such are contained in predicates as such 
hence when a middle term is a predicate it ccm 
ixbias when a subject it is contained 

such is the case when the proposition is at one 
and the same time universal and affirmative when 
the proposition is at one and the same time uni 
versal and affirmative the predicate is necessarily 
larger than the subject from this it follows that 
wherever the middle term is a predicate it is ipso 
facto larger than the subject and contains the sub

ject on the other hand wherever it is a subject 
it is smaller than the predicate and contained by 
it 

now in barbara the middle term is not only a 
subject but the subject of the major proposition 
what would it be if it were the subject of the 
minor one it would be something awkward or 
at any rate something that would bring in limita 
tions or complications of some kind inasmuch as it 
would be in its wrong place it would be subject 
and small where it ought to be predicate and large 
as a middle term it ought to contain the minor 
as a subject it would be contained by it 

 

imperfection of the second figure — the middle 
term not really middle 

if the predicates and subjects in universally 
aflsrmative propositions be essentially and as pre 
dicates and subjectsy of different capacities it is 
obvious that a middle term which is only a pre 
dicate is below its functions i e that it is incom 
petent to perform the double duty of containing 
and being contained 

nevertheless au the middle terms of the second 
figure are predicates and predicates only they 
all in universally aflirmative propositions contain 
they none of them are contained if this be the 
case where are our majors nowhere they are 
minors 

it is obvious that complications or limitations of 
some sort must come out of this imperfection in the

function of the middle term of the second figure 
and come they do there is no such a thing as 
has already been stated throughout the figure as a 
universally affirmative conclusion there is no 
affirmative conclusion at au the conclusions are 
one and all negative 

 

imperfection of the third figure — the middle 
term not really middle 

§ if predicates and subjects in universally affir 
mative propositions be essentially and as predicates 
aad subjects of different capacities a middle term 
that is only a subject must be below its functions 
•i e incompetent to do the double duty of contain 
ing and being contained 

nevertheless all the middle terms of the third 
figure are subjects and subjects only they all in 
universally affirmative propositions are contained 
none contain k this be the case where are our 
minors they are all majors 

we foresee what is to come of this in the third 
figure where the middle term is only the subject 
we expect only negative or particular conclusions 
and this is all that we shall find 

 

imperfection of the fourth figure — the middle 
term not rationally middle

being imperfect fail when applied to the fourth

tet the fourth is if anything the most imperfect 
figure of all that it was the longest in being 
discovered has already been stated it has also 
been suggested that it was no very valuable disco 
very when made the fourth figure is the one 
which is most generally either avoided or re 
duced yet it has one of the characteristics of 
the first — the model first the perfect first its 
middle term is truly middle it stands between 
its major and its minor what is this but mediety 
or middlehood it stands between two other classes 
and it contains intermediate quantities — more than 
one less than the other is not this enough it 
is enough perhaps to make a middle if we look 
for mediety or middlehood alone but we look for 
more than this we must get not only an inter 
mediate midcue but a greater major and a smaller 
mmor but this the fourth figure denies us 

in the fourth figure the middle term is the pre 
dicate of the major proposition the major term 
being of course the subject now term for term 
the predicate as opposed to the subject gives the 
larger or containing class here however this 
larger or containing dass is represented by the 
middle or smaller term whilst vice versa the 
major or nominally larger term is the subject or 
contained term 

mutatis mviandis this contradiction repeats 
itself in the minor proposition there the middle 
term being the subject is smaller than and con 
tained in the minor which it ought nominally to 
contain 

it is not then too much to say that middles of 
this kind are irrational middles as middles alone

they stand fairly enough but they terribly dislo 
cate their neighbouring majors and minors in 
fiswt they convert the one into the other 

in figure iv all the conclusions are either parti 
cular or negative this is what we expect and 
that a great deal of manoeuvring in the way of 
conversion and reduction is necessary in order to 
transfer its syllogisms into figure i has been seen 
in fiut figure iv is figure i inverted 

if we now inquire as to the amount of dis 
turbance manifested in the imperfect figures we 
shall find that it is as follows — 

for figure ii — a contained instead of a contain 
ing majoty and a containing instead of a contained 
middle 

for figure iii — a containing instead of a con 
tained minor and a contained instead of a contain 
ing middle 

for figure iv — a containing minor and a con 
tained mijor 

it is obvious that wherever there is an abnormal 
middle term there are limitations and complica 
tions to match 



 
recapitvlation 

we may now recapitulate our statements upon 
the place and fimction of the middle term 

its place is in the premises as opposed to the con 
clusion in which last its presence was impossible 
the conclusion gave the results of a measurement or 
classification the premises the act of measuring or

dassifying the result being obtained the means 
by which it is brought about are kept back 

in the premises it had to appear twice there 
being two things to which it served as a means of 
measurement or classification it had to deter 
mine that for instance man was tnortal and also 
that heroes were men 

it had not only to appear twice but each appear 
ance had to be made in a different premiss were 
it not so it must have appeared twice in the same 
and that would have given us nothing but a truism 
— men are men 

thus far its place was a matter of absolute 
necessity inasmuch as unless the previous con 
ditions were complied with there would have been 
no syllogism at all the following were necessary 
for a perfect one 

the middle term should be really middle ie it 
should contain one of the remaining terms and be 
itself contained by the other 

but to make it this a simple place in two dif 
ferent propositions was not enough for the 
middle term to be really middle it was necessary for 
it to be a subject in one of its places and a predi 
cate in the other 

nor was it enough for it to be really middle it 
must be really and rationally so for though a 
place between a major and a minor may make a 
middle the majors and minors themselves may 
be unreal — the major being smaller instead of 
larger than the middle the minor larger instead 
of smaller 

hence for middles to be really and rationally 
middle their majors and minors must be real and

rational also and this can only occur where the 
major contains and the tnmor is contained 

but the former of these conditions or the major 
containing the middle can only be found where the 
major is predicate and the middle subject the pre 
dicate being essentially the larger or containing 
term the subject the smaller or contained 

and the latter or the middle containing the minor 
can only be found where the minor is subject ie 
the smaller term 

but ex vi termini it is only in major proposi 
tions that we find major terms and vice verad 
hence it is only where the middle term is subject 
in the major and predicate in the minor that it is 
really and rationally at one and the same time 
a contained and containing term

th ordmoiry syllogism caued aristoteucm 

the syllogism when it is jfiramed in obedience to 
the rules just laid down and when it takes the 
form just exhibited is conveniently called the aria 
toteucm syllogism and it is called so by numerous 
important writers the term is by no means 
unexceptionable neither is it open to any very 
grave objections it is intelligible and convenient 
and not more incorrect than the generality of terms 
of the same kind 

the reason for the name is scarcely to be found 
in the fact of aristotle being answerable for its 
present form inasmuch as the ordinary syllogism 
is framed according to a series of hints and infer 
ences miscellaneously distributed over his writings 
but put into form and developed by his commen 
tators rather than according to anything sytema 
tically exhibited by the master himself 

again the fourth figure is attributed to galen 
this alone subtracts a certain number of formulab 
from the aristotelian list of moods and figures —

propositions 

supposing even that all the others are due to 
aristotle the accuracy or inaccuracy of the cur 
rent doctrine respecting galens share in the deve 
lopment of the syllogism as it stands at present is 
not very important the common view even if 
incorrect is to a certain extent against the state 
ment that the syllogism called aristotelian took 
its name from the fact of aristotles having given 
it its shape and sent it forth into the world under 
the sanction of his great and influential name 

the truer reason for the use of the word lies in the 
extent to which during the prevalence of the aris 
totelian philosophy the syllogism in as near as can 
be its present form was the great instrument of 
reasoning with the schoolmen and philosophers 
akin to them it was according to the rules of the 
syllogism that the vast majority of theological 
moral and other questions were investigated 
meanwhile the authority of aristotle was allpow 
erfiil and it was in accordance with his formulae 
either expressed or implied that men either actually 
reasoned or imagined that they did 

the name aristotdicm then as applied to the 
ordinary syllogism is convenient it is also current 
whether however the rules upon which the syllo 
gism is framed are each and all actually of 
aristotelian origin is another question 

are they exceptionable or unexceptionable suf 
ficient or insufficient capable or incapable of im 
provement is anything admitted that ought to 
be excluded is anything excluded that ought to 
be admitted this is to be seen

 propositions 

 
certain ariatotelicm syllogisms overstrong 
in propositions like 



i some men are heroes 
a john is a man 
a john is a hero 

the conclusion is too strong for the premises or 
rather the premises are too weak for the conclusion 
in other words there is a violation of the fourth 
rule of the th section the conclusion being more 
general than the premises the conclusion being 
universal the premises being partly universal and 
partly particular in consequence of this the three 
sentences under notice are neither more nor less 
than three separate and unconnected propositions 
they are anything but a syllogism they only 
take the guise of one 

upon combinations of this kind enough and 
perhaps more than enough has been said there 
is something however to be said concerning their 
contraries what is the result when the premises 
are too strong for the conclusion or rather the con 
clusion is too weak for the premises in other 
words what takes place when the limitations of 
our fourth rule are not only observed but observed 
too strictly what takes place when the last of

more

into y x the same conclusion follows if we call a 
syllogism fundamental when neither of its premises are 
stronger than is necessary to produce the conclusion it is 
obvious that every fundamental syllogism which has a 
particular premise gives at least as strong a conclusion 
when that particular is strengthened into a universal but 
except when strengthening the premise also enables us to 
strengthen the conclusion in which case we have a new 
and different syllogism it seems hardly systematic to mix 
up with fundamental arguments syllogisms which have

the import and suggestions of the following imagi 
nary 

dialogue 

examiner — what is the predicate in the major proposi 
tion of this syllogism 

elephants are stronger than horses 
horses are stronger than men 
elephants are stronger than men 

hasty student at once — horses 

cautious student after a pause — stronger than horses 

examiner — the latter answer is the right the former 
the wrong one horses is the subject of the minor 
stronger than horses the predicate of the major proposi 
tion what follows from this 

hasty student — that the conclusion is true 

cautious student — that there is no middle term 

examiner — as a matter of fsust each answer is correct 
the latter however is correct as a point of logic in 
syllogisms like the one in question thebb is no middle 

tebm 

students — is it right then to call such combinations as 
the one in question syllogisms 
examiner — we can scarcely deny them the name 

neither can we the conclusion that they give 
is true and over true it is also deduced from the

premises what more is wanted hear what pro 
fessor de morgan says 

extbact 

 a is greater than b b is greater than c therefore a 
is greater than g there is no middle term here the 
predicate of the first proposition is a thing greater than 
b the subject of the second proposition is b 

 admitting fully that the quality of the premises — that 
which entitles the conclusion to be made is as it is said 
a fortiori — marks this argument out as if anything 
stronger clearer and could such a thing be truer than a 
simple syllogism yet it is plain that the very additional 
circumstance on which this additional clearness depends 
takes the argument out of a syllogism as defined by all 
writers — formal logic p 



 

syllogisms in which both the premises are 
particular 

it has been stated in § that firom two parti 
cular premises no conclusion can be drawn is 
this a rule for all or is it a rule for only the aristo 
telian syllogisms 

it is tiot a rule for all syllogisms it is only a 
rule for the aristotelian 

this may be seen by the following operations 
on — 

a all men are mortal 

a all men are rational beings 

i some rational beings are mortal

weaken either of the two premises into — 
a all men are mortal 
i some men are rational beings 
i some rational beings are mortal 

datid 

we have seen what comes of this the fact 
of the premises in darapti being overstrong has 
already been stated the rule however in question 
has been adhered to 

to have written — 

some men are mortal 

some men are rational beings 

some rational beings are mortal 

•would have been to have written three unconnected 
propositions looking as if they formed a syllogism 
but not doing so in reality 

but what if instead of the word some we had 
written in the premises the words toore than half 
in that case our sentences would have run thus — 

more thorn half the men in the universe are mortal 
more than half are rational beings 

therefore 
some rational beings are mortal 

is this a true conclusion it is why then do 
we deny that the proposition in which it is em 
bodied fonns a syllogism because the aristotelian 
rules exclude such expressions as more than half 
limiting our quantities to the terms ally some and 
none

questions suggested by this and the two preceding

modification is enough 

 

two or more propositions disguised as one 

§ no proposition has more than two terms viz 
one subject and one predicate where there is 
more than one of either there is more than one 
proposition nevertheless we may have two or 
more propositions conveyed by a single sentence the 
commonest instances of this are the cases where 
with two difierent subjects we have the same pre 
dicate or with two diflferent predicates the same 
subject thus — 

 the sun and the moon shine 

 the sun shines and dazzles 

in each of these sentences we have in reality 
two propositions viz — 

 

a the sun shines 
 the moon shines 

 
a the sun shines 
 the sun dazzles 
this is because sun and moon shines and daz 
zles are separate and independent terms 
had we however said — 

 the sun along with the moon shines 

 the sun shines so as to dazzle 

the condition of the two latter words would have

pbopositions 

been different they would have been subordi 
nated to un and smne so as to constitute only a 
single proposition this single proposition how 
ever would have been many worded in respect to 
one of its terms 

this difference between two separate terms and 
one compound is shown in the grammar of the 
following sentences — 

 the sun and moon shine 

 the sun shines 

 the moon shines 

 the sun shines and dazzles 

 the sun shines so as to dazzle 

such are the examples of two propositions dis 
guised as one 

 
propositions as parts of terms 

§ a pair of simple propositions is one thing a 
single proposition consisting of a multiplicity of 
subordinate terms is another 

i have now to remark that terms may be so very 
manyworded as to embrace not only other terms 
like themselves but even whole propositions 

 the man is returning 

 who was sent to market 

combine these omitting the words is and return 
ingy which serve as copula and predicate and they 
form but a single subject thus the man who 
was sent to mxirket is returning the words

study of grammar and rhetoric somewhat late and 
beginning it with a definition of the difference be 
tween poetry and prose was surprised to find that 
he had talked prose all his lifetime without knowing 
it instead ot prose write proposition and mon 
sieur jourdains case is our own we have uttered 
propositions ever since we knew how to speak 
uttering them unconsciously we have never stated 
either a truth or a truism without forming a propo 
sition we have never misstated or heard mis 
stated a fact or a pretension to a fact without 
either delivering or listening to or writing or read

tion that was not a proposition never effected a 
command that was not one

propositions 

consider all this carefully and you will have 
found one way of measuring the great proportion 
which propositions bear to the rest of our conver 
sation 

or you may get at the same result by consider 
ing what words do not enter into the structure of 
propositions and by observing how few they are 
they are just the words like ah oh pish 

they will not combine with other words so as to 
form sense they will neither make a proposition 
by themselves nor help to make one in conjunction 
with other words the person who uses them 
uses them as he would use a gesture to express 
surprise pain or contempt but although he uses 
them thus he makes no affirmation he no more 
affirms that he is surprised or that he is in pain 
or that he is scornful than if he started back or 
laid his hand upon a tender part of his body or 
curled his lip contemptuously and in like manner 
the hearer understands his meaning but he would 
have understood a gesture as well nothing is 
affirmed or denied by the words neither do they 
enter into propositions wherein anything is affirmed 
or denied they are wholly independent of pro 
positions as much so as the hiss of a snake or the 
groan of a wounded animal — expressions of which 
we infer the meaning but expressions as to the 
meaning whereof we are not informed in the way 
that we are informed by propositions 

save and except such words as these there are 
none in the whole universe of language that exist 
independently of propositions 

that they are words which exist out of or be 
yond the limits of propositions has been shown

 propositions 

but an existence beyond the irniits of a propositioti 
is by no means the same as an existence ind 
pendent of a proposition though words like 
therefore because if c form no part of any one 
proposition at all they connect several 

hence by observing that there are but two 
classes of words that do not enter into the structure 
of propositions that neither class is numerous and 
that the words of one of them though belonging 
to no single proposition imply the existence of 
tvo we find additional proofe of the great extent 
to which propositions are the staple and foundation 
of language 

we may find them too by looking in another 
direction mathematicians who rarely write upon 
language without supplying valuable suggestions to 
even the professed philologues have oftener than 
once attempted an expression of its laws by means 
of signs and symbols algebraic in either detail 
or principle the following extracts are from the 
laws of thought by professor boole they show 
that by means of literal symbols we may express all 
terms and by means of four signs all the relations 
between them now every one of these terms 
implies the existence of a proposition with the ex 
ception however of the class of words like oa ah 
c they represent all that is represented by lan 
guage

proposition i 

 all the operations of language as an instrument oj 
reasoning may be conducted by a system of signs composed 
of the following elements

propositions 

• st literal symbols as x y dc representing things as 
subjects of our conceptions 

 ilnd signs of operation as f — x standing for 
those operations of the mind by which the conceptions of 
things are combined or resolved so as to form new concep 
tions involving the same elements 

 rd the sign of identity 

n •n f l n n 

 class i 
 appellative or descriptive signs expressing either the name 
of a thing or some quality or circumstance belonging 
to it 
 let us agree to represent the class of individuals to 
which a particular name or description is applicable by a 
single letter as 

 if the name is men for instance let x represent all 
men or the class men by a class is usually meant a 
collection of individuals to each of which a particular 
name or description may be applied again if an adjective 
as good is employed as a term of description let us re 
present by a letter as y all things to which the description 
of good is applicable i e all good things or the class 

 good things let it further be agreed that by the 
combination x y shall be represented that class of things 
to which the names or descriptions represented by x and 
y are simultaneously applicable thus if x alone stand 
for white things and y for sheep let x y stand for 

 white sheep and in like manner if z stand for homed 
things and x and y retain their previous interpretations 
let zxy represent horned white sheep ie that collec 
tion of things to which the name sheep and the de 
scriptions white and homed are together applicable 

 class xl 
 signs of those mental operations whereby we collect parts 
into a whole or separate a whole into its parts 
 we are not only capable of entertaining the concep

 propositions 

tions as characterised by names qualities or circum 
stances applicable to each individual of the group under 
consideration but also of forming the aggregate conception 
of a group of objects consisting of partial groups each of 
which is separately named and described for this pur 
pose we use conjunctions and or c in this and in all 
other respects the words and or are analogous with the 
sign f in algebra let x represent men y women 
and let f stand for and and or then we have — 

 y y ip 
let the symbol stand for the adjective european then 
since it is in effect the same thing to say european men 
and european women we may have — 

zx yzx zy 
the above are the laws which govern the use of the sign 
here used to denote the positive operation of aggregating 
parts into a whole but the very idea of an operation 
effecting some positive change seems to suggest to us the 
idea of an opposite or negative operation having the effect 
of undoing what the former one has done thus we 
cannot conceive it possible to collect parts into a whole 
this operation we express in common language by the sign 
except as all men except asiatics all states except 
those which are monarchial here it is implied that the 
things excepted form a part of the things from which they 
are excepted as we have expressed the operation of 
aggregation by the sign f so we may express the negative 
operation above described by — minus thus if x be taken 
to represent men and y asiatics ie asiatic men then 
the conception of all men except asiatics will be ex 
pressed by a — y and if we represent by x states and 
by y the descriptive property having a monarchial form 
then the conception of all states except those which are 
monarchial will be expressed by a— a y

class iii 
 signs by which belation is expressed y and hy which we 
form propositions 
 though all verbs may with propriety be referred to this 
class it is sufficient for the purposes of logic to consider 
it as including only the substantive verb is and are since 
every other verb may be resolved into this element and 
one of the signs included in class i the above sign is 
or arcy may be expressed by the symbol the stars 
are the suns and the planets let us represent stars by 
a suns by y and planet by z we have then — 
xy z 
 now if it be true that the stars are the suns and the 
planets it will follow that the stars except the planets are 
suns this would give the equation —

bird hence — we may say as many have said 
that all black birds are not blaekbirda crows are 
not and all blomirds are not black birds a hen 
blackbird is not this is a convenient and common 
illustration of the difference between tvx words 
and a compound word 

when the combination consists of two words 
there is an accent on each of them as in hlck 
bird 

when the combination results in a compound 
the accent is on only one ie the first of them 
eg blkbird hence we pronounce and often 
write as follows — 

au black birds are not bldckbirdsy and all 
blackbirds are not black birds 

now the same kind of difference that exists be 
tween bldck bird and blackbird exists between some 
thing and ssmething a difference which is of 
no small importance what have we written about 
propositions that they are sentences consisting 
of certain members elements or constituents called 
subject copula and predicate and that they either 
assert or deny something concerning something 
the something here spoken of is evidently a com 
pound word spelt as such and accented as such — 
ssinething not sdme thing 

the smething then that is spoken of in the 
definition of a proposition is a word like blackbird 
and not a word uke bldck bird 

we shall see the reason for this distinction if we 
ask what would have been the case if it had been 
otherwise ie if the definition of a proposition 
had been that it was a sentence wherein and 
whereby some thing was affirmed or denied of

asme thing what with such a definition as 
this would be the case of such a statement as 

john is a hero 

woidd it be right to say that human beings 
like john are things that heroes are things as 
suredly this is not the language either of common 
life or the common law in both of which we 
draw a clear distinction between persons on one 
side and things on the other a person is not a 
thing neither is a thvng a person nevertheless 
the statement that john is a hero is a proposition 
neither is the ordinary definition inaccurate all 
that is wanted to reconcile the two apparent con 
tradictions is a clear remembrance of the feet that 
ssmething has a wider meaning than sne thing 
the former includes persons and things properly so 
jailed the latter excludes persons 

persons are not the only somethings that are 
opposed to things jmmaterial beings essences 
existences entities or whatever else they may be 
called are in the same predicament we can make 
such jmopositions as the following —

patience is a virtue 

fear is unworthy of a soldier 

conscience is a good guide 

all that remains is hope 

there is no remedy but patience

snow is white this speaks of snow and says 
something about it is white then a nime of some 
thing there is only one way in which the word 
white is a true and universallyadmitted name it 
is a true and universallyadmitted name when we 
speak of the word as the word itself it is a 
true and universallyadmitted name when we say — 

white is an english word 

white is a word of five letters 

white is a word beginning with w and ending 
with e 

white is a word of common occurrence 

white is often used for white thing 

white is sometimes used for whiteness 
in this case it is something that strikes our 
senses — shearing or sight it does the former when 
it is uttered by some one with whom we speak 
the latter when written or printed by some one 
whose writing or printing we peruse in the 
former case it is the name of a particular combina 
tion of sounds in the latter it is a collection of 
written characters or if we chose to express our 
selves more generally of certain points and lines 
endowed with the property of expressing certain 
sounds 

in any other sense but this we cannot intro 
duce such a word as white into the subject of a 
proposition unless in combination with other 
words or parts of words with a change of power 
eg —

a white crow is a rare bird 
whiteness is the chief property of snow 
white is my colour 
white then in strict language is a thing only 
so far as it is a word and it is in strict lan 
guage a name of something only so far as it is the 
name of a word 

nevertheless we use it as a name this is be 
cause though no true name itself it suggests what 
is actually a true name viz whiteness the name 
of the attribute or quality suggested by white

the ten thousand and more hammersmiths

the eclipses c of newmarket constitute part

a coramon name is one which denotes a whole

thomas is a single and particular individual of 
the class called man julius ccesar a single or

of the particular class under which it may please

individual names singular 

 § examples of this sort may be given ad in 
jmitum the main point however to be remarked 
remembered and reflected on is the following — 

common names apply to thiugs of which there 
may be more than one individual names apply to 
things of which there is one and no more there 
are many towns but there is only one london

many men but only one thomas many con 
querors but only one julius ccesar 

individual names therefore are also singular 
names and there are many good writers who habi 
tually call them so preferring the term singular to 
individvxil 

the opposite to singular is plural — london is 
a large town — london and boston are large towns 
— msecserias was a patron of literature — virgilius 
maro was a poet c — maecsenas and virgil were 
romans 

singulus is the latin for each and from sin 
gulus we get the word single meaning one 

plures is the latin for more and from plures 
we get the word plural meaning more than one 

father horse stone c are singular we use 
them in speaking of one object and no more than 
one 

fathers horses stones c are plural we use 
them in speaking of two or more objects 

 

individual names proper 

§ individual names are also proper names and 
there are many good writers who habitually call 
them so — preferring the term proper to either sin 
gular or individual 

the reason for this lies in the fact of individual 
names being appropriated or made proper to 
certain single individual objects to which they are 
exclusively attached

individual and common names — necessity and 
usefulness of common ones — extract 

where the number of individual objects is in 
finite it is clearly impossible to give a name to 
each this compels us to make one name serve for 
many in this compulsion we finj the origin of 
common terms 

such is the view that is suggested to the reader 
and such i believe on the whole to be not only 
the true one but the one universally admitted pro 
vided always that we discriminate between what 
is commonly called the eflscient and the final causes 
of general names the final cause the word being 
used in its curreut but exceptionable sense of 
general names is their function as terms in all pro 
positions of any value whatever without them 
it is reasonably iargued that we should be unable to 
state the result of a single comparison between two 
different objects we should have nothing but 
truisms eg john is john c we should be 
well nigh as badly off as if we had no names at

all be it so nevertheless we have no reason 
to believe because the possession of them is of the 
highest value and the greatest importance that it 
is also the cause of their having been invented

extract from mills logic — 

extract 
 and here i cannot omit to notice an oversight com 
mitted by some eminent metaphysicians who have said that 
the cause of our using general names is the infinite multi 
tude of individual objects which making it impossible to 
have a name for each compels us to make one name serve 
for many this is a very limited use of the function 
the italics are the present writers of general names 
even if there were a name for every individual object we 
should require general names as much as we do now 
without tbem we could not express the result of a single 
comparison nor record one of the uniformities existing in 
nature and should be hardly better off in respect to in 
duction than if we had no names at all with none but 
names of individuals or in other words proper names 
we might by pronouncing the name suggest the idea of 
the object but we could not assert a single proposition ex 
cept the unmeaning ones formed by predicating two proper 
names one of another it is only by means of general 
names that we can convey any information or predicate any 
attribute even of an individual much more of a clsiss — 
system of logic book iv chap § 

in this extract the word function has had atten

§ it was stated in § that common terms were 
also called general the word general however 
is not entirely free from ambiguity 

the best illustration of this is to be foimd by a 
reference to the language of the naturalists zoolo 
gists and botanists 

genua is a latin word signifying hind or sort 
its plural is genera 

species is also a latin word signifying kind or 
sort its plural is the same as its singular ie 
species 

genus a icvad or sort genera hinds or sorts 
derivatives general generality generally — gencn 
ric generically — generalise 

species i a kind or sort species kinds or 
sorts derivatives special specific specify c 

both genus and species denote classes we may 
call them if we choose class names 

question — of the two classes which is the 
larger of the two classnames which is the more 
comprehensive does the genus comprehend the 
species or the species the genus 

aoiswer the genus is the larger and more com 
prehensive a genus may contain a species but no 
species contains a genus if this rule be neglected

 in the language of common life it is never neglected 
by that class of investigators who have most to do 
with these two terms viz the naturalists be they 
botanists or zoologists 

let us look at some of the classes upon which 
the naturalist employs himself the objects of his 
science iu its widest sense comprise men the lower 
and even the lowest animals trees plants mine 
rals even the fluids of the ocean and its rivers and 
the gases of the atmosphere how vast a difier 
ence between the two extremes of this wide field of 
inquiry the objects however are capable of 
arrangement an arrangement which has by no 
means been overlooked first comes the great 
division between the organic and inorganic worlds 
the former containing all objects that grow and are 
endowed with either animsd or vegetable life the 
latter such as have neither life nor growth 

say that the mineral world is inorganic and it 
is dear that organisms fall into two great kingdoms 
as they are called the names of which we already 
anticipate there is the animal kingdom with its 
birds beasts and fishes the vegetable with its 
trees and plants its flowers and weeds its forests 
and meadows 

each of these falls into divisions and subdivi 
sions how wide the difference in the vegetable 
world between the fern and the rose the moss and 
the oak amongst animals what can stand fur 
ther apart fiom each other than our horses oxen 
and sheep fiom the sponges and corals of the sea 
yet there are more sorts of sheep horses and oxen 
than one whilst of sponges corals and the like 
there are vast and unnumbered classes

 names 

of animals that so fex agree with ourselves as 
to have an internal skeleton external organs of 
sense and other conjoint attributes — of animals that 
the naturalist calls veirtebrcua how clear and de 
finite to even the commonest observation is the 
difference between a quadruped a bird a frog or 
snake and a fish how truly does each of these 
animals not only differ fitm the rest but agree with 
a whole group of others say that every bird 
agrees with all other birds more than with any fish 
and we get a notion of the import of the word 
bird as a classname different however as are 
birds and fishes they are more alike than fishes 
and insects birds and shellfish 

of birds the birds of prey belong to one class 
the poultrykind to another c each falling into 
divisions and subdivisions there are eagles and 
hawks and vultures on one side turkeys and 
chickens and peafowl c on the other the same 
process may be applied to the objects of the vege 
table kingdom the kingdom itself comprises the 
oak and the moss the seaweed and the mould on 
the damp wall the violet and the lily but the 
mosses and seaweeds though belonging to different 
classes are still included in a group which excludes 
the lily and the oak themselves belonging to dif 
ferent groups and themselves constituting groups 
that fall in kvisions and subdivisions sections and 
subsections 

such is the sketch of the classes of the zoologist 
and botanist as they present themselves if we pass 
from the larger to the smaller ones from the 
organic world to the vegetable kingdom from the 
vegetable kingdom to the dass of flowering plants

from the class of flowering plants to the family or 
tribe of violets 

but we may reverse the process we may begin 
with the violet and end with the organic world 

the dogviolet and the sweet violet belong to 
different divisions of the violet class a class which 
excludes the rose the oak the lily c 

yet the rose the oak and the lily belong to a 
division of the vegetable kingdom that excludes the 
moss the fern and the seaweed — plants with no 
flower 

all however are vegetables as opposed to 
animals 

mutatis mutandis we say may the same of horses 
eagles snakes shellfish flies c 

the horse and ass belong to one dass a dass 
included in that of 

beasts as opposed to birds and fishes 
yet beasts birds and fishes belong to the class of 
vertebrate animals ie animals with an internal 
skeleton to which shellfish fiies worms micros 
copic animals c do mot belong 

yet they are all animals the animal and vege 
table kingdoms making up the organic world 

the classes under notice are like those chinese 
curiosities where a large hollow ball contains a 
smaller one which contains a smaller one still 
which contains one still smaller which contains 
c c till we get to the smallest of all which 
contains nothing but which is itself contained by 
the smallest but one in this there are two ex 
tremes the largest and the smallest all the other 
sizes being intermediate 

of these extremes we may begin with either 

i

to begin with the largest and end with the 
smallest is to descend 

to begin with the smallest and end with the 
largest is to ascend 

the class that comprehends all the others is the 
highest and as svnumvmh is the latin for highest 
a class of this kind is called svmitnuni genus our 
words sum and sumvuxry are derived from this 
summrum 

the class that comprehends no other but only 
so many individuals is the lowest and as injlmuta 
is the latin for lowest a class of this kind is called 
infimum genus 

so much for the extremes what however is 
the logical name for the intermediate classes the 
dasses smaller or lower than the summwm larger 
or higher than the irijinum genus we call them 
by a name which a thought upon the constitution 
of the british army will explain in the british 
army a certain class of officers are called subaltertis 
they are above the private soldier below the com 
missioned officers think of the subalterns of an 
army and you will remember that the intermediate 
genera of the logician are called genera svhaltema 

the relations suggested by this word subaltern are 
found everywhere in the domain of thought and lan 
guage these are found wherever there is a change 
of import coinciding with a change u relation 

what is the word men in such a series of pro 
positions as —

but the name of a class larger than that of heroes 
and smaller than that of mortals as such it is 
the name of a subaltern genus 

extract 

 a species then it is plain when predicated of indivi 
duals stands in the same relation to them as the genus to 
the species and when predicated of other lower species 
it is then in respect of these a genus whilst it is a 
species in respect of a higher genus as quadruped 
which is a species of animal is a genus in respect of 
 horse which latter again may be predicated of bu 
cephalus and other individuals such a term is called a 
subaltern species or genus being each in respect of dif 
ferent other terms respectively 

 a genus that is not considered a species of anything 
is called summum the highest genus a species that is not 
considered a genus of anything ie is regarded as contain

individual and common names — degrees of

§ a genus is said to be general in proportion 
as it contains or has under it other genera thus 
organized being is a more general term than ani 
maz animal than quadruped and quadruped than 
horse and vice versa 

londoner is a less general term than english 
man unglishmxm than tnan mxin than cmimal 
animal than organized being c 

hence there are degrees in the generality of 
terms some being nearer to the summiun genus 
and as such more general and some being nearer

to the infima species and as such more specific 
or special thaa others 

more thaa this — the names themselves of genus 
and species change their application according to 
the changes of relation between the classes to which 
they apply there is no such thing as a name 
exdusively applicable to a genus no such thing as 
a name exclusively applicable to a species on the 
contrary the name which on one occasion is a 
genus is on another a species and vice versd 
talk of heroes and tncm is a genus talk of 
animals and mam is a species 

genera are at different distamxses from each other 
in all heroes are men all men are animals all 
animals are orgaaized beings the class of mer 
immediately includes that of heroes and so doing 
is called its nearest proximum genus whilst that 
of animals constitutes a remote remotvm genus 
the longer the series of subalterns between the 
sfumrmim and the vafima the more numemus the 
degrees of nearness and remoteness 

observe — it has been stated that some writers 
instead of the word common use general so that the 
opposite to an vruuvidual is a general name when 
this is the case it is convenient to denote the ap 
proach of a subaltern to a summum genus by the 
word generic this is merely saying that anvnud 
is a more generic term than man min than eng

no mention of the vegetable kingdom at all and 
vice versd had it been a mere question of roses 
lilies oaks mosses or lichens — a question of vege

have lain so entirely out of the pale of our dis

might have applied to them the axiom thttt things 
nonapparent were no better than things nonex

would have been the animal or vegetable kingdom

take the largest number that the largestminded 
arithmetician can conceive let us double treble 
or quadruple it let us multiply this till the 
figures become too numerous to deal witl let us 
do all this and more so as to swell and magnify 
it indefinitely infinitely and having done all 
this let us reverse the process by subtracting 
from it the smallest fraction of a single humble 
and scarcely appreciable unit what shall we have 
got by our trouble we shall have got two things 
instead of one we shall have got instead of a 
single sum a difference and a remainder each of 
which has its name no matter how small or how 
large it may be 

let the single solitary unit thus subtracted from

but what is a grain of sand amongst so many

we have succeeded in separating it from the mass 
at large and giving it a separate existence small 
as it is we succeed in giving it a certain amount of 
attention we have done more we have given it 
a very great deal of attention we have put the 
universe in one scale and it in another and we 
have looked at each indeed it is very possible 
that we may have thought quite as much upon the

you have also the division of names into nega

a little consideration will show that for the 
most part negative names of the kind in question 
are of no great use also that when words aie of 
no great use they rarely find their way into lan 
guage it is of course possible to have for every 
positive name a negative to match yet no lan

the opposite to negative is positive all 
names are either one or the other the extent to 
which the latter preponderate over the former has 
been seen nor is this wonderful in all the 
cases before us and in innumerable others like 
them the positive dass is so very limited and the 
negative so inordinately wide that the latter con 
tains objects upon objects that have nothing in 
common with one another except the mere fact 
of their being different firom something else — a 
difference in most cases insufficient to give the 
grounds of a useful classification

and all that is not briton is alien no third term 
comes between them this is not the case with

another

does something more it declares that one attri

cold 

the real words to which cold and jtot cheap and 
deavy are simply negative are temperate and mode 
rate or average as we may easily imagine by 
thinking of a scale of jirices or a thermometer 

different again are words like blind c 
blind means unahle to see but it also means 
something more chairs and tahles are imable to 
see so are au objects destitute of an optic nerve 
— by far the larger portion of creation yet these 
are not the objects we call blvnd the objects we 
call blind are those members of a class naturally 
endxywed with sight which are unable to see such 
are sightless men and women amongst human beings 
and moles amongst quadrupeds hence blind 
means wnahle to see when sight is expected a 
blmd object is not merely an object without sight 
but an object deprived of it or at any rate an 
object which is exceptional to the dass to which it 
belongs 

now the eodreme character of words like hot 
and cold c and the exceptional character of 
words like blind c have the effect of giving a 
positive character to a negative name and this is 
the case with many other words for different rea 
sons unrpleasomt means something more than 
the mere negation of pleasantness inconvenience 
is a stronger term than not convenient 

words like blind c are called privative —

§ of the three views that can be taken of the 
universe or to speak more conciseljj of the three 
universes it is the third with which the logician

have no real existence whatever 

the universe of discourse is generally narrower 
than either of the other two but it is not so 
necessarily nothing prevents a thinker or speaker 
from making either nature in general or the world 
of the imagination the subject of his discourse 
nothing prevents him from taking from it on one 
side a fraction of infinitesimal smauness and com

relation of the difference would be that of the grain 
of sand of a previous section or even less oc

magnitude and distance and the feeling thereby 
engendered of the insignificance of him who views 
them the sens of self — of self in its smauness 
— comes upon him how vast the universe how 
small man how insignificant amongst men i 

in thoughts of this kind the separation of the 
universe into two parts of utterly disproportionate 
magnitudes is made on one side is a single indi 
vidual of a single species on the other countless 
collections yet no inclination arises on the part 
of the maker of this division to create a name for 
the two classes though he might do so by merely 
joining the words not and by denoting him 
self by noti everything else 

he might do this though he does not he 
might do it as far as language is concerned inas 
much as noti is as good a word as nothxyrae or 
notman c yet he does not do it and the 
reason why he does not is because the feeling of 
separation that throws his thoughts upon himself is 
accompanied by a feeling of weakness littleness 
insignificance nullity what is he that he should 
weigh himself against everything else and be one 
in a dualism egotist as his contemplations have 
made him they have made him a humble one

it is well known that more than one profound

belief in the existence of an external material 
world arguing that the only things concerning 
which the mind of a sentient being can be sure are 
its own states of consciousness whether there 
are corresponding objects beyond he mind of the 
thinker is doubtful 

the only certain fact in the eyes of an idealist 
philosopher of this kind is his own mental existence 
of this he is sure of everything else doubtful

himself and everything else is not only real but in 
favour of the thinker the i or if he find the

substance omd attribute — abstract arid concrete 

we now come to four new terms that mutually 
illustrate each other they run in pairs and 
subatcmce and attribute and abstract and 
concrete they do not take us away from the con 
sideration of the important divisions that we have 
just been considering altogether though they do so 
for a while 

substomce is from svh under and statis 
stantis itcmdmg it is the same word in 
respect to its etymology as hypostasis which is 
from hypo under and stasis staadvng the 
diflference between the two words consists in the 
former being of latin the latter of greek origin 

attribute is from ad to and tributum a 
thing paid an attribute being that which we 
ascribe give to lay to the account of or connect 
with anything to pay a man the compliment of 
being honest is to attribute honesty to him 

concrete — con is the latin word cvm with 
cretum is the participle of cemo cemo in the 
latin is usually translated see ox perceive it is 
however the same as the greek word crino jcplvm 
 judge so that the truer and mler import of the 
word is to denote observation with judgment 
where we not only see an object but see it in such a 
manner as to take cognizance of either the differences 
between its constituent parts or the difference be 
tween the object itself and others we get the com 
pounds discemy and discrete dis difference 
separation where we not only see but take

cognizance of points of likeness rather than differ 
ence we use con swithunionunity and get 
words like concem and concrete wherever we 
have anything concrete we have an union or con 
junction of ualities or properties 

abstract is the opposite to concrete both in 
meaning and in derivation abs from whilst

drawn off and this is as different from concrete as 
subtrclction is from addition

§ take for instance an orange it strikes our 
senses 

we see with our eyes that it is more or less 
round ie that it is endowed with the property or 
quality of roumdaess 

we see too that it is more or less yellow i e 
that it is endowed with the property or quality 
of yellowness 

we see that it is more or less smooth ic en 
dowed with the property or quality of smooth 
ness 

our eyes tell us all this the eyes being the 
sense by which our belief as to the properties in 
question is conveyed to us they tell a great deal 
more but this it is unnecessary to enlarge on 

then comes the evidence of our other senses 

by our ears we detect a sound if we rub the 
skin with our fingers we also do so if we squeeze 
it so as to let the juice flow from one compartment

a loaf a man a fish or anything else may be con 
sidered in the same way they are of course 
when taken altogether different from those of an 
orange the principle however of considering 
them is the same 

let us now suppose that all these attributes 
are one by one taken away and replaced by 
others that instead of an orange striking our eyes 
and sense of touch as roimd it strikes them as 
square or rhomboid that it loses ite fragrance and 
becomes fetid that it sounds like a bell and tastes 
like a loaf of bread would the object still be an 
orange would it not be something else this 
leads to the question of the essential attributes or 
essences of things never mind them for the present 
but put your thoughts in a somewhat different 
direction 

divest the orange of all its attributes without 
supplying it with new ones what will it be then 
take away its original colour without replacing it 
by any fresh one let it lose its softness without 
becoming hard its roundness without becoming of 
any other form annihilate its weight taste and 
smell let it have no means of appealing to eye 
ear taste smell or touch so that it become at one 
and the same time impalpable invisible impercep 
tible what will it be then will it be anything

link now unites them the orange in which they 
met being no more 

but we may unite them afresh — say in the idea 
of a golden ball a guinea a full moon c 

and we may also separate them again and again 

united they give the idea of an object clear 
palpable sensible separated or abstracted from 
those objects they do nothing of the kind 

yet the mind takes cognizance of them the 
idea of the particular attribute of yellowness ab 
stracted from an orange is not much more difficult 
than the idea of the orange tninua the attribute of 
yellowness it is merely a case of difference and 
remainder the additions and subtractions being 
made unconsciously and instinctively 

what becomes of the orange is it annihilated 
by the abstraction of its attributes one and all 
few are prepared to say yea to this question few 
divest themselves of the notion that sensible and 
material objects are nothing more than the combi 
nation of certain properties qualities and attributes 
each and all of which may be removed in such a 
way as to leave an absolute nothing we rather ima 
gine that where there are certain attributes in union 
there is a certain link which connects them a basis 
or foundation which supports them a basis or foun 
dation different from the attributes themselves — 
something which they are not but upon which they 
rest 

this aomethitig stfpports them this something 
stands under them this something is the aiibatatice 
or wnderatanding of objects as opposed to and

abstrdct narnes how far individuul 

§ each of the cardinal virtues is a species of the 
genus virtue 

if so their names are common rather than 
individual terms at any rate virtue is a common 
name and not only that but a common term of 
some generality since it comprises prudence and 
charity just as colour comprises redness and white 
ness 

but what if these special virtues be personified 
as they were in the creeds of antiquity and as 
they are in the imagination of artists they then 
become individuals so does virtue itself — general 
or generic though it or she be or what if we 
look upon the group with the eyes with which we 
view the soldiers of a regiment— the soldiers being 
so many individuals the regiment being the collec 
tion which they constitute 

whichever view we take we ought to be led to 
a question of some interest viz the extent to which 
abstract names are common or individual 

extract 
 do abstract names belong to the class of general or 
to that of singular names some of them are certainly 
general i mean those which are names not of one single 
and definite attribute but of a class of attributes such is 
the word colouty which is a name common to whiteness 
redness c such is even the word whiteness itself in 
respect of the different shades of whiteness to which it is 
applied in common the word magnitude in respect of the 
various degrees of magnitude and the various dimensions 
of space the word weight in respect of the various degrees

of weight such also is the word attribute itself the common 
name of all particular attributes but when only one attri 
bute neither yariable in degree nor in kind is designated by 
the name as yisibleness tangibleness equality square 
ness milkwhiteness then the name can hardly be con 
sidered general for though it denotes an attribute of 
many different objects the attribute itsek is always con 
ceived as one not many — mills logic b i c § 

in this extract singular means individual and 
general means common the view embodied in it 
is by no means unexceptionable colour is doubt 
less a more general name than redness if by general 
we mean belonging to a higher genus generic see 
§ 

the fact is that colour is more general than 
redness just as army is more general than regiment 
both words being collective and both as such more 
or less individual 

without being individual to the extent that such 
names as john julius ccesar and the socalled 
proper names are individual abstract names whether 
general or specific are at least on the confines of 
individuality 

 

attribute — why a better term than quality — 
attribute of a quantity 

§ this is the place for a question concerning the 
word attribute and its relation to the word quality 

the former is a somewhat rare word a word 
that may almost be called technical the latter is 
current common and intelligible it is the word 
too which when we spoke of the whiteness of snow 
c we used pretty freely at any rate we called 
whiteness a quality of snow quite as often as we 



digitized by

names 

called it an attribute why then not have done 
so always why use two terms when one would 
have sufficed why take up such a word as attri 
bute at all when quality would have served instead 

again why not aslj property instead of even 
quality it is perhaps the commoner word at 
any rate it is equally intelligible it is a word 
too of which the cognate derivative proper has 
already been in use we spoke of proper names 
why not of the properties of individuals or classes 
whiteness is a property of snow it belongs to 
snow it is something that snow if it could speak 
might call its own 

quality is derived bom qualis which is a word 
somewhat difficult to translate it answers nearly 
to our word such and more still to our word 
suchlike a roman however would not trans 
late either such or suchlike by qualis the latin 
for svh or suchlike is talis a word evidently in 
a certain relation to qualis as we infer from the 
similarity of form 

the nearest english translation of the word 
qualis is the somewhat awkward compound whal 
like 

 question what and whatlike were his reasons for 
acting as he did 

 answer oh they were such and suchlike he gave 
a long list of them 

a quality y then is the whatikeness of an 
object 

whiteness is a quality of snow because by 
possessing that property snow is like some other 
white object — which it is like or whichlike it is 

wherever there is a quality there is likeness

of the same origin with quality are the words 
qvriddity and quomtity they are each deriva 
tives from the root qw so that as far as the first two 
letters go the three words agree — guaktygtiddity 
gttantity the three last letters agree as well 
all three end in uy all three being derived from 
the latin words in taa taiis viz gualifos qu 

idditaa and quaniitas tas or tat being in 

latin the sign of abstraction 

conceming quiddity there is little or nothing to 
be said it is obsolete nor need much at pre 
sent be said about quantity the only object of 
the present section is to give a reason for the use 
of the word attribute when apparently quality 
would do as well this lies in the fiict of au 
qualities bemg attributes though all attributes are 
not qualities 

in other words quality is a species of the genus 
attribute attribute being of course the wider and 
more general term 

another species of the same genus another term 
subordinate to attribute is quantity the quati 
tity of any substance being as much one of its 
attributes as its colour taste or any ordinary 
quality 

this distinction is neither more nor less than 
a distinction of the common language of conversa 
tion the fact of a couple of men being two their 
twonessj so to say though allied to the fact of 
their being mortal or their mortality belongs to a 
difierent class of phenomena the one is a matter 
of quantity the other of quality both however 
are attributes 

it is then the greater generality of the word

names 

attribute which brings it into use it includes 
quantities as well as qualities 

the logical difference between quality and pro 
perty a difference not made in common language 
need not here be explained 



 
attribute of relation 

there are then two kinds of attributes viz 
qualities and quantities 

are there any others there is certainly one 
more and that in the history of language a most 
important one one to which quantity itself is sub 
ordinate the attribute of kelation 

the ordinary qualities of objects are more or 
less permanent and inherent to their several sub 
stances if an object be white it cannot become 
black or red without an absolute change in its 
nature or characteristics it may not indeed 
always or even generally be converted into some 
thing else inasmuch as the change may not go r 
enough to affect what are called its essential quali 
ties nevertheless the change may be considerable 
and it may be of a permanent kind it is certainly 
intemal i e it applies to something contained 
vithin the range of attributes that belong to the 
substance in which they occur 

but what are we to say to changes that leaving 
all the ordinary qualities of an object exactly as 
they were still are changes 

what are we to say to changes that in some 
sense are no changes at all do we not in the 
first place ask whether they actually exist can

one man be converted into another at all can he 
be so converted without any alteration whatever of 
any one of his qualities he can a man may 
for the purposes of language take the name of 
another man of a horse of an inanimate object 
or of anything else m rerwm tiaturd and that 
truly and without losing any one of his original 
qualities or gaining any fresh ones 

he may do this by a change of relation we 
saw our way to sometiiing in this way in the sec 
tion upon genera the subaltern classes were 
greater or smaller according to the point from 
which they were viewed they were this without 
any change whatever in the way of actual mag 
nitude 

words like father sttid son master and servant 
ruler and subject are of the same kind the 
father of john may be the son of thomas yet 
father and son are essentially diflferent not to say 
opposite names 

it is the point of view from which we contem 
plate the relation between such objects or ideas 
as these that determines the application of the 
names different as they are they may yet apply 
to the same object more than this they may be 
changed and shifted from one object to another 
the father of one moment may be the son of 
another and vice versa 

a stone in a certain relation to the speaker i e 
in his hand is named this the same stone when 
thrown to a distance is named that

duty as the name of a stotie may stnd for a father

nevertheless the stones fathers sons pens c 
that are named this or these are in all matters of 
ordinary quality the same as the fathers sons pens 
c named that or those the change of attribute 
that justifies the change of name being simply that 
of relation to either the speaker or some other 
object 

it may be said that words like this and that are 
not names that they are not permanent un 
changeable and irremovable names is true but 
why should permanence c be considered essential 
to the idea of a name the words in question are 
terms and they denote objects it would be diffi 
cult to show that more than this is necessary to 
constitute a name 

the fact is that words of the sort in question 
are not only names but names of a very important 
kind 



 

convertible nam£s 

the difference between individual and common 
terms has long commanded the attention of both 
logicians and grammarians 

not so however the difference between the two 
classes of names which form the subject of the pre 
sent section — the difference between the incon 
vertible and convertible in the natural history of 
language no distinction is more important than 
this neither is it useless but on the contrary 
very useful in ordinary grammar 

in order to understand it a clear notion of the

is auimportant 

compare the word with the word writer the 
latter is a name which can be applied to a certain 
class of objects only a writer for instance must 
be a person probably he will be a person of 
a certain age or one who has arrived at years of 
discretion he will also be more or less civilised 
finally he will write a child is no writer 
a savage no writer consequently to neither 
children nor savages does the word writer apply 
to apply it to a person who ndther will nor can 
write who neither has written nor is about to 
write is to misapply it it is a word that can 
only refer to a certain class of objects and as 
such is mvariable 

but what is the case with a child may say 
 am not a maa and a man may say atn not a 
child and yet the word retain its proper power 
when wuliam says it means william when 
thomas says it means thomas if a mother 
says it means a mother and a female if a 
father says it means a father and a male even 
if an inanimate object be personified and be sup 
posed to speak about itself and to say it means 
that inanimate object it denotes the speaker 
whoever it may be 

the same applies to you which denotes the 
person spoken to whoever he may be if speak 
to you and you are named williamy you means 
william but if your name be thomas then 
thomas is what is meant by you any object that

animate objects there is nothing in the universe

this and that have been noticed already 

it is obvious then that words like you he 
this that c are what may be called convertible

c are inconvertible the former can be applied 
to any or at any rate to several objects no matter

how dissimilar the latter applies to one class of 
objects and no more 

instead of saying convertible and inconvertible 
we may say variable and invariable 

all convertible names are individual this is trans

case with we ye these c plural as these words 
are in form they are really collectives 



 

notation or denotation and conrnotation — inr 
dividual natnes not gonnotative 

convertible names simply note or denote the 
objects to which they apply 

to simply note or denote an object is to point 
it out to mark it out to set a mark on it by 
which it shall be distinguished from all other ob

to explain this distinction the robber in the story

wish to know again it says this and nothing 
more the house itself however was a great deal 
more than this it was the house of a wealthy 
owner it was the house in which much gold lay 
it was a cottage a mansion a messuage a first 
class residence a tenement c as the case might 
be but the chalkmark told us nothing of this 
it merely told us what it was not hence when 
morgiana marked all the other houses in the same 
manner she defeated the scheme not be it ob 
served by rubbing off the chalk on haji babas 
door but by annihilating its value as a distinctive 
mark by placing the rest of the street in the 
same predicament 

if haji baba had lived in london instead of 
bagdad no chalk would have been needed there 
would have been the number on the door — say 
no and this would have been the mark 
of the house the mark by which it was dis 
tinguished from nos c all perhaps 
alike in external appearance that this would 
have been sufficient for the purposes of the robber 
is clear provided only he could read the number 
and remember it as no 

the chalkmark and no then are the names of 
the houses in question 

let them be used as such in a conversation with 
some second person what purpose will they 
serve it is certain that whatever else they may 
supply they will not supply a description of any 
kind they will not tell anything positive at all 
they may be used in conversation but if the per

signify something different from no no c 
and something different from all things whereon no 
chalkmark is to be seen 

but substitute house for no c and you wiu 
find that you are using a word of a different kind 
altogether a word that not only denotes something 
but which ccmnotes something as weu a house 
 such has certain attributes it serves certain 
purposes it contains certain apartments it is 
bounded by walls covered by a roo£ all this is 
the case with no or the ohjed marked with 
chalk — when we know it to be a house but not 
before until we have learned that it means a 
house we only know that it is not something des 
titute of a chalkmark or that it is something 
either not nimibered at all or nimibered differently 
in other words whilst house implies the existence 
of certain attributes no or the object marked 
with chalky implies nothing of the kind except so 
far as the number or mark itself is one 

to pass to another illustration 

at first sight it seems much more definite in 
speaking of pictures to say a flora by rubens 
than a painting by an artist inasmuch as the 
former expression teus us not only that it is 
a painting of which we speak but that the sub 
ject of it is a heathen goddess and the artist 
the great flemish master and so it is — under 
one proviso but not otherwise this proviso is 
that we must know from other sources that it is 
art and artists that we are speaking about it is 
only with this knowledge that words like flora 
and rubens have any practical meaning at all so 
little do they of themselves tell us anything

that unless there be a context to explain them 
flora may mean a blood mare and rubens her 
sire as has actually been the case it is a current 
story in one of the sporting counties that an artist 
having called to see a famous flora by rubens was 
shown into the stable the owner of which might 
perhaps have been equally surprised if an artist 
who had heard of his fondness for such things had 
shown him into a picturegallery 

this illustrates the extent to which individual 
names unless explained by a context are useless for 
the purpose of supplying information concerning the 
nature of the objects to which they apply they 
only give us what we may awkwardly denomi 
nate their socalledness — ie the feet of their 
bearing a given name flora differs from rubens 
and rubens from flora in having different names 
— the name in each as long as it is the only fact 
known concerning them being their one solitary 
property or characteristic this single and solitary 
as it is is still sufficient for one important pur 
pose that of denoting them or marking them as 
separate from everything else the name flora for 
instance separates even the unknown object that 
bears it not only from rubens but from all other 
objects not named flora 

individual names of the kind in question then 
require a context to explain them ie to tell us the 
class of objects to which they apply unless they are 
thus accompanied they are in the condition of the 
words of a foreign language this is preeminently 
the case with the socalled proper names 

it is also the case with words like j this that

knows what this or that means from the bare use of

 names 

the words themselves every one knows what they 
mean when the object to which they apply is either 
pointed out or indicated by the rest of the con 
versation 

this too is the case with the class of abstracts 
although their application as individual terms is 
peculiar abstract naipes are essentially the names 
of intellectual and internal rather than of material 
and external objects they are preeminently the 
names of ideas now yellowness is as much an 
individual idea as the painter rubens is an indi 
vidual human being it is also equally a sub 
stance i e equally the basis of an attribute it is 
a name that we can apply to many objects but so 
we can the words j thouy flora c which are 
nevertheless the names of individuals rather than 
of classes like rubens no or the chalk 
mark of our first illustration it serves only for the 
purposes of separation dividing ydlow from u 
yeuow this it does and it does no more it 
connotes nothing it simply notes or denotes 

the reason why individual names are thus non 
connotative lies in the fact already suggested of their 
conveying nothing beyond the mere socalledness 
or natyiedness of their objects whether this be 
an attribute will be considered in the sequel 

in j this c the attribute is that of the parti 
cular relation for the time being of the object to 
which the words apply to some other object to the 
speaker or to both 

in abstracts the individual character of the name 
yellowness lies in the singleness of the idea which 
it expresses the idea being based upon the peculiar 
character of certain sensations created by yellow 
objects in general

there is nothing however that is so necessarily 
connected with yellowness as to make the word 
suggest anything like a class the objects connected 
by the fact of their all being yellow are of the same 
heterogeneous character as the objects connected by 
certain negative names e g norirhorse c see §§ 
 — indeed abstract and negative names have 
much in common the former give but one at 
tribute the latter something even less than this 
viz the bare fact of the objects to which they 
apply not being something else 

all individual names are notative dienotative or 
tiowrconnotative 

 

notation c — common names connotative 
characteristicsy or essential attributes 

§ all common names are connotative 

they all apply to classes of objects 

classes of objects consist of certain individuals 
endowed with certain attributes and these attri 
butes in order for the objects to which they belong 
to form a class must be numerous they must at 
any rate be mxyre than one 

it is by having a certain number of attributes 
alike that objects belong to the same class it is 
by having a certain number unlike that they belong 
to diflferent divisions of it 

it is evident that all the attributes of an object 
are not of equal importance whilst some cannot 
be changed without changing its character some 
can be withdrawn and replaced by others the 
character of the substance to which they appertain

remaining unaltered in other words some attri 
butes are characteristic others not some essential 
or necessary to make the object what it is esse to 
be others imessential or indifferent 

the ink with which these lines were written was 
black and fluid the ink with which they were 
printed was black but scarcely fluid the ink 
with which they were written however might 
have been red or blue nay there is such a thing 
as purple ink the imperial signatures of the 
byzantine caesars were made in it indian injc is 
a solid capable however of being made fluid 
then there are several sorts of invisible ink car 
pable however of being made visible 

there is no ink however which cannot be used 
for writing limning shading tnarhing or some 
similar application to which its fluidity and colour 
are subservient and it is probably safe to say 
that the essential character is its use for the above 
named purposes fluidity and colour of some kind 
are also of great importance the particular de 
gree however of fluidity and the particular tint 
are matters of indifference they may be changed 
without making the ink into notink 

the same applies to every object in either natm 
or art to which a common or class name can be 
attached except in the cases of absolute identity 

in order for objects of the same class to differ 
from each other they must exmbit their difference 
in some unessential attributes to differ in an essen 
tial one is to belong to a different class this 
implies that there must not only be at least two 
attributes to the object but that there must be 
two sorts of them — essential and unessential

differctice of view respedvng the characteristics of 
classes 

§ it is not every one that takes the same view 
of the essentiality of an attribute in the eyes of 
a grazier dover is a gra so at least he would 
cau it if he were speaking of the difference between 
the natural and artificial grasses wheat on the 
other hand and oats and barley are no grasses in 
his eyes but so many kinds of com still less is 
the sugarcane a grass yet this is what they are 
in the eyes of the botanist who withholds the term 
from clover 

whence the difference 

the grazier considers one set of attributes essen 
tial the botanist another 

in the eyes of the same farmer the bulb of an 
onion is a root inasmuch as it has in his eyes the 
essential attributes of one it lies more or less 
below the surface of the soil it appears to feed 
the leaves flowers and seeds it comports itself 
in short except in certain apparently unessentigj 
points like the root of ordinary plants 

in the eyes of the botanist however it may do 
all this and much more and yet be no root it 
grows upwards like a stem instead of downwards 
like a true root the true root is the bunch of 
fibres that grow at the bottom of it the bulb it 
self is an underground bud ah this difference of 
view arises out of the fact of the ordinary observer 
making one set of attributes essential the botanist 
another

relation between ncmiea and classes — the class 
growing out of the name 

§ the manner in which common names come 
into existence belongs to the natural history of 
language rather than logic it is convenient 
however to notice the relation between the employ 
ment of them and classification 

as soon as two or more persons agree in apply 
ing the same combination of sounds to the same 
combination of essential attributes a name has 
come into existence the objects to which it applies 
being indefinite in number and to a great extent 
unknown to the persons who first used the term 
they may be infinite they may be few they 
may be single they may be nonexistent in 
nature i e creatures of the imagination only 
they may be words like animal or words like 
planet or words like universe or words like 
dragon centaur or hippogriff c they may be 
words of any extent or no actual extent at all 
all that they have to do is to apply to such and 
such objects as often as they exhibit such and such 
attributes objects which may appear often or rare 
ly or never — objects which we may see every hour 
in our life or objects that we can only contemplate 
in the most excited stat of our fencies it is no 
matter whether we do it firom our experience or 
our hallucinations but so long as we group to 
gether certain attributes and designate the collec 
tion by a certain combination of articulate sounds 
we create names and so far as the other individuals

names 

with whom we have conversed agree in understand 
ing such names in the same way we introduce our 
creations into language 

in this way common terms become current amongst 
considerable masses of men the objects to which 
they apply being either alike or diflferent in unes 
sential attributes only it often happens that at 
first the number of such objects is but small com 
mensurate with the limited experience of the first 
authors of the term as time however goes on as 
the number of speakers increases and as experience 
enlarges new objects are continually brought under 
the same denomination so that the magnitude of 
the class increases in respect to the number of in 
dividuals that it contains 

nor is this all the larger the number of such 
individuals the greater the chance of differences 
between them hence the number of udessen 
tial attributes increases and doubts arise as to 
whether some of them may not be essential the 
name that began with the object a and was ex 
tended to b between which and a there was no 
notable difference may lose some of its intelligi 
bility when it has arrived through c d e c to 
x y or z nevertheless so long as it applies to a 
certain number of objects it is a common or class 
name against which the worst that can be said is 
that the dass to which it is attached is not a very 
natural one 

such is the case when the name precedes the 
class or in other words where the class grows out 
of the name as is the case in ninetynine hundredths 
of the ordinary language of common life

glass 

§ there are cases however where the process is 
reversed and where the name grows out of the class 
such are the scientific terms of the chemists bo 
tanists zoologists c where after a full and suffi 
cient knowledge of certain groups of individuals 
and the determination of their essential attributes 
we find that our class is one for which the rougher 
looser uncertain and empirical phraseology of the 
current language supplies no term sufficiently exact 
a fact which forces upon us the invention of a new 
one 

extract 

we have adverted much less than is usual with 
logicians to the ideas of a class and classification — we 
have considered names as having a meaning quite inde 
pendent of their being the names of classes — as soon 
as we employ a name to connote attributes the things be 
they more or fewer which happen to possess those attri 
butes are constituted ipso facto a class — by every 
general name which we introduce we create a class if 
there be any existing things to compose it — classes 
therefore mostly owe their existence to general language 
but general language also though that is not the most 
common case sometimes owes its existence to classes —

time goes on names show a tendency to change 
their signification if it were not so language 
would be greatly more uniform than it is 

let a name originally apply to a few individuals 
and let the difference between those individuals be 
slight let au the birds for instance to which the 
name swan applies be either white or whitish at 
any rate let none of them be of a colour opposite 
to white let whiteness pass for an essential at 
tribute of wanhip or swcmhood what hap 
pens when a bird black in hue but in all other 
respects like a swan presents itself are we to 
abandon the essentiality of the attribute white 
ness or are we to deny to the new bird the 
name swan it is not necessary to decide all 
that it is at the present time necessary to notice is 
the undoubted fact that there is hereby introduced 
into the question of names and classes a disturbing 
force of no slight importance 

we get a certain amount of disturbance from a 
swan that is simply hlach but this is not much 
there are other attributes that create greater com 
plications let the swan that serves for our illus 
tration be not merely a swan with certain wn 
swarirlijce attributes but let it have some of the 
characteristics of the goose let these be either 
actually essential or considered to be so what 
follows not only doubts as to whether the bird 
be a swan or not but doubts as to whether it may 
not be a goose or it may be something interme 
diate to the two — neither swan nor goose but 
some third sort of bird anonymous but capable of 
being named

from birds let us go to bows — rainbows ob

but this decidedness is not general where the blue

so they do where the red becomes yellow or the 
yellow red so they do on all the confines of all 
the colours when are we to say that that blue or 
red end and green and yellow begin and vice

spects gradual are still capable of being distinguished 
when all the gradations are imperceptible the

typic normal or standard forms of a class becomes 
uncertain and indefinite on its confines 

in many of the complications thus engendered 
the essential attribute steps in and helps us but 
it is far firom doing so in all inasmuch as it is 
itself in a vast number of cases a matter of doubt 
it is not every two or three speakers that agree as

this can be done and we come to the considera

definitions 

§ we have seen from what the word definition 
is derived and we anticipate its meaning a de 
finition is a boundary — a boundary by which all 
the individuals of a given class are included so 
inchided they are separated from everything else 
everything else being eaxjluded from them 

wherever there is a definition there is a name 
but it is not all names that either are susceptible 
of definition or require to be defined definitions 
are wanted where the import of a name becomes 
doubtful the import of names becoming doubtful 
whenever the essential character is obscure over 
looked or controverted 

the name indicates the class 

the definition explains the name 

hence whilst a name constitutes a term a 
definition constitutes a proposition a definition 
being 

a proposition explanatory of a term in all of 
which the term to be explained is the subject the 
term by which the explanation is made the predi 
cate — 
subject predicate

all definitions denote the objects of the class to 
which they apply nevertheless it is not every 
denotation that is a definition to point at a man 
crossing the street is to denote him to lay your 
hand on him and to say this is he ia also to denote 
him nevertheless pointed fingers and the use of 
words like this and he aie not considered to be 
modes of definition that they partake of its nature 
is dear still it is not the habit of language to 
identify them 

words susceptible of definition must connote as 
well as denote something this being only another 
way of saying that they must be common or class 
names 

dialogue 

a john is a man 

b but what is a man 

a man is everything to which the combination m x n 
applies — this being the name of a class 
j what constitutes that class 

a certain attributes such as animality rationality and 
others of either less importance or involved in these 

b the definition then of m a n is that it is a name 
connoting certain attributes 

a yes or a name which when predicated of any sub 
ject impues that that subject possesses them in such 
a sentence as john is a man the word m a n is the 
predicate in man is a rational animal it is the sub 
ject 

it is not always that we can define a class or to 
speak more accurately the meaning of a classname 
how can we do so when it runs into another by 
imperceptible gradations

names 

extract 

 a name ought to be like a boundary which clearly and 
undeniably either shuts in or shuts out every idea that can 
be suggested it is the imperfection of our minds our 
language and our knowledge of external things that this 
clear or undeniable inclusion or exclusion is seldom attain 
able except as to ideas which are well tidthin the boundary 
at and near the boundary itself all is vague there are 
decided greens and there are decided blues but between 
the two colours there are shades of which it must be un 
settled by universal agreement to which of the two colours 
they belong to the eye green passes into blue by imper 
ceptible gradations our senses will suggest no plan on 
which all agree at which one is to end and the other to 
begin 

 but the advance of knowledge has a tendency to supply 
means of precise definition thusj in the instance above 
cited wollaston and fraunhofer have discovered black 
lines which always exist in the spectrum of solar colours 
given by a glass prism in the same relative places there 
are definite places in the spectrum by the help of which 
the shade of any colour therein existing may be ascertained 
and the means of definition given — formal logic p 



 

classification by type 

§ it is only then as knowledge advances that 
certain definitions become possible what are we 
to do in the mean time the answer to this was 
found in the fact that although some of the mem 
bers of a given group may be on the debateable 
land between two classes there are others which 
lie well within the boundary 

say that some lie in the very centre of the in

the classes with which its frontiers may come in 
contact as is the case with centres of each of the 
coloured bands of the rainbow as is the case with 
the red where it is equidistant from the purple on 
one side and the orange on the other we can in 
such cases take such members of the class in ques 
tion as standards samples or types of the group 
to which they belong and so doing arrange the 
remainder around them the nearest being the most 
unequivocal members of the class the next nearest 
being somewhat less the more remote intermediate 
to some other class or possibly of doubtful po 
sition 

to do this is to classify by types as opposed to 
the classification by means of definitiona 

in the former we take a central object and group 
others round it without much caring whether the 
outsiders so to say belong to the same class as 
those of the interior 

in the latter we draw a line round a certain 
number of objects without much caridg whereabout 
within the iqclosure they lie provided only that 
they do lie within it

parts of speech 

§ what is meant by a part of speech in one 
sense every word that exists in language is a part 
of speech inasmuch as it is by means of words that 
the speech by which man communicates with man 
is constituted human speech being made of words 
but these words are again made up of syllables 
the syllables being again made up of certain ele 
mentary sounds if so every syllable is a part of 
speech and so is every elementary sound 

but this is not what the grammarian means 
when he talks of a part of speech as he often 
does sometimes indeed he talks or writes about 
the parts of speech as if there were something 
special and particular requiring the use of the defi 
nite article to denote them open any ordinary 
grammar and it is an even chance that the first 
sentence runs thus — the parts of speech are 
eight or nine as the case may be noun 
pronoun verb c

to the effect that grammar is the art of speaking 
and writing correctly but the ordinary opening is

such is the importance of the parts of speech

parts of speech — number criteria c 

§ nouns pronouns verbs participles adverbs 
conjunctions prepositions interjections and the 
like are the parts of speech now under notice and 
there is something beyond what is found in the 
ordinary grammars to be said concerning them 

there is something to be said concerning the 
nutober of them 

something also concerning the criteria by which 
they are separated from each other 

 

parts of speech — number of them 

§ and first concerning the number of the parts 
of speech sometimes it is said that the parts of 
speech are eight sometimes that they aie nine 
sometimes that they are no more than three in 
latin where the article is wanting the list runs 
— noun pronoun verb participle adverb preposi 
tion conjunction interjection total eight 

in english we have an article an and the which 
makes our parts of speech from a latin point of 
view nine

google 



 pabts of speech 

but some writers instead of speaking of nouns 
speak of substantives and adjectives by which they 
make two parts of speech out of one in which case 
their list runs — substantive adjective pronoun c 

finally there are many who limit the parts of 
speech to the noim the verb and the particle 
referring to the first the substantive the adjective 
and the pronoun including the article to the second 
the participle to the third the remainder 

all however agree in this viz the recognition of 
the terms noun substantive adjective pronoun 
article verb participle adverb preposition conjunc 
tion interjection particle along with other names 
less general such as numeral cardinal ordinal 
relative pronoun personal pronoun c 

 
parts of speech — criteria 

§ so much concerning the extent to which gram 
marians difier in respect to the number of the parts 
of speech and so much concerning the extent to 
which they agree in admitting that in some sense or 
other nouns verbs fee are parts of speech how 
do we account for their agreement how for their 
difference 

the reason for their agreement lies in the fitct of 
certain fundamental principles lying at the bottom 
of all forms of speech however different jfrom each 
other in detail 

the reason for their difference is not so simple 
sometimes it arises out of the actual difference of 
language one language wanting something that the 
other has this being the case with the latin as

generally however there is a difference between 
the views taken concerning the marks signs cha

is separated from another why says one 
writer make the two classes of substantives and

a word which can by itself form a term is called 
categorematic 

a word which cannot by itself form a term but 
can by itself form a part of one is called syncate 
gorematic — yn with and implying imion or con

categorematics 

categorematic words fall into two divisions ac 
cording to the kind of term they are capable of 
forming every word that can form a subject can 
form a predicate also the converse however is 
not the case there is a large class of words which 
can form predicates but cannot form subjects a 
word that forms both subject and predicate is either 
a substantive or a pronoun a word that can form 
predicates only is an adjective

matters ought to be but as they are the logical 
terms might much more advantageously be learned 
before those of the grammarian the import of which 
they most especially explain 

to proceed the categorematic words which can 
form predicates only may if necessary be called 
predicative those that form subjects and predicates 
as well being called subjective no more com 
plex word than this is wanted no such word as 
subjectivopredicative or the like need be coined 
whatever can be a subject can be a predicate also 
and the simple term subjective does as well as a 
longer and more compound word 

the subjective categorematics then coincide with 
substantives the predicative with adjectives to a 
certain extent 

 

categorematic words nominal subjective and 
quadnominal predicative 

§ the word subjective and substantive predica 
tive and adjective coincide to a certain extent — to 
a certain extent but not altogether there is 
a considerable class of subjective terms which a 
grammarian would hesitate to call substantives in 
other words it is only some of the subjectives that 
are substantive in order to understand this we 
must look upon our subjects and predicates in a 
fresh light how far are subjective and predicative 
words names something upon this question has 
already been written in § where it is stated 
that although such a word as whiteness is a name 
such a word as white is not whiteness is the

parts of speech 

name of an attribute white is no true name at 
all it is only a word which suggests one many 
doubt this many deny it many say that white 
is a name many say that white is the name of 
white thing also that white is the name of the 
attribute whiteness but a little consideration will 
show that white the adjective and white the sub 
stantive i the equivalent to white thing white 
person c are in different classes and a little 
consideration will show that the name of the cha 
racteristic attribute of white things is whiteness 
not white 

that words like white are neither the names for 
white objects nor the names for the attribute of 
whiteness becomes plain and clear after a very little 
consideration the question whether they are 
thames at all is somewhat more complicated it is 
possible and not diflscult to define the word nam 
in such a manner as to include not only adjectives 
but a great many other words besides hobbes 
definition for instance does this which is to the 
effect that a name is an arbitrary word serving for 
a mark and raising in our mind a thought like 
some thought we had before and which when pro 
nounced to others may serve as a sign of the 
thoughts of the speaker 

a definition of this latitude would convert not 
only adjectives but interjections into names 

a definition of this latitude even if it suit the 
logician is unfit for the grammarian who finds it 
convenient if not necessary to limit the word 
nam to substances common language does the 
same it is difficult to imagine a name without 
some object named and what can this be but a

variably suggest a name that though they are not 
names themselves they are nearly so — very nearly 
so they are names within a little they are au

on the strength of its being a name on the 
strength we may say of its nominal character or 
nominality a pronoun can play the part of a sub 
stantive in a proposition and be subject or predicate 
just as the speaker chooses to make it 

that a pronoun is actually a name — a name of a 
iubstance — is clear what do we mean by j b 
them by this by that c most imdoubtedly a 
substance a substance with all its attributes many 
or few as the case may be the whatever or 
whoever answers to the word this is an object 
of which either the senses or the imagination can 
take cognizance it may be a mem a horse a 
stone a phoenix or a cardinal virtue still it is an 
object and when we know what or who is meant 
we can change the pronoun into a substantive and 
say man horse c instead of this that c the 
feet is that in their application pronouns and sub 
stantives are connected with exactly the same class 
of objects the something which they denote being 
the same the way in which they denote it being 
different contrast with this use of words like i 
thou c that of words like red white fee and 
you will see the difference between the pronoun and 
the adjective and the extent to which the former is 
an actual name whereas the latter is only a word 
suggestive of a name 

a pronoun then is a kind of substantive — at 
any rate it is a name applied to substances there 
is however only one kind of substantive with 
which it agrees with the important dass of common 
or general names it has little to do all pro 
nouns as has been already stated are individual 
or singular or proper names none are common

they are all words like john or london rather 
than words like mem or town 

nevertheless there is no single member of any 
dass of objects whatever to which such a pronoun as 
this or that may not apply it may mean a tnan a 
horse c as aforesaid surely this is anything but 
individuality singularity or propriety is it not 
something rather the opposite is there not an 
idea of generality plurality i had almost said im 
propriety attached to a name which may denote 
any one object out of a million or more indif 
ferently what can well be commoner than a 
term which will denote anything or everything 
individual names have been said to apply to things 
of which there is one only one and no more than 
one and singular has been said to mean much the 
same as individual the name however of the 
things that such a word as this can apply to is 
legion yet this is an individual or singular name 

proper names too seem at first to be as unlike 
pronouns as they well can be a proper name is a 
name appropriated to some particular individual 
appropriated in such a manner as to be incapable 
of any application elsewhere to name a man john 
and to call him thomas is not to name him at au 
it is to misappropriate two terms at once to rob 
thomas without enriching john yet one and the 
same object may be called this and that i and thou 
and no misappropriation occur nevertheless this 
and that i and thou c are proper names 

the explanation of this apparent complication is 
simple it lies in the fact so essential to their con 
stitution of pronouns being convertible or variable 
names a pronoun may mean anything whatever

and apply to any amount of objecis real or imagi 
nary but it can only mean denote or signify 
one object or group of objects at a time as long 
as john speaks of himself i means john but when 
thomas talks of his self i means thomas as long 
as a certain white stone is nearer to me than a 
certain black one this means white stone change 
their places and it is better expressed by that the 
huich stone being what answers to this 

pronouns then in so far as they denote but one 
object or one collection of objects at a time are 
individual singular or proper terms they depart 
however from the character of the true proper 
names like john and london in being able to ex 
press any amount of different objects at different 
times in short they are as aforesaid variable or 
convertible names 

 

pronouns the names of substances — how far 
common 

§ if pronouns depart in some respects from the 
character of the true and typical individual sin 
gular or proper how nearly do they approach that 
of the common or general names the exact 
measure of the distance is as unimportant as it is 
unattainable it is only certain that there is a 
broad line of demarcation between them a common 
name however generic it may be always denotes 
objects that have a certain real or supposed relation 
to each other objects with a certain amount of 
attributes in common an oak and a seaweed are 
equally vegetables a mite and an elephant equally

animals but no one would call a book a vege 
table or an inkstcmd an animal yet an oak a 
seaweed a mite an elephant a book an inkstand 
a griffin a colour a virtue may au be denoted by 
words like this and f indeed there are no two 
objects in the whole range of the real or the ima 
ginary universe that are so unlike each other as 
not to be brought under the designation in ques 
tion and that easily and without the creation of 
either obscurity or ambiguity of language 

though a pronoun is a name it is not a class 
name it applies indeed to objects numerous 
enough to form a class but this is not sufficient 
objects to form a class must not only exist in 
certain numbers but bear to each other a certain 
amount of resemblance this is done by their 
having certain attributes in common 

this means that whilst common names are con 
notative pronouns are simply notative 

connotative names § are founded upon the 
existence of more attributes than one notative on 
the existence of one only hence a pronoun is in 
the same class with words like john and london 
rather than with words like tnan and town 

 

pronouns the names of stibstances — simply if otor 
tive denotative — the attribute they denxte

character of the pronouns exists

arts op speech 

present writer r g latham or any other desig 
nation of the author of the page now under notice 

now this convertibility of the pronouns arises out 
of the nature of the attribute that it expresses 

the attribute expressed by a pronoun is always 
and exclusively an attribute of relation and it is to 
the fact of relations being changeable that the pro 
perties of the pronoun are due 

relations change qualities are what is called 
inherent for an object to be called red it must 
in and of itself possess the quality of redness 
for an object to be designated as this it requires no 
peculiarity of constitution at all it merely re 
quires to be in a certain relation to the speaker or 
some other object it may become that without 
any alteration whatever of itself it need not 
even change its place it is enough for the speaker 
to change his or for a different speaker to talk 
about it 

a pronoun then is the name of a substance 
denoted by a single attribute that attribute being 
the attribute of relation 

as the name of a substance it can form the 
subject of propositions and as the ordinary sub 
stantive can do no more it is in that respect sub 
stantival 

as a name founded on the denotation of a single 
attribute it connotes nothing and consequently can 
be applied to anything though only to one object 
at a time 

but as that single attribute is the attribute of 
relation and as relations can change pronouns can 
be applied to any number of objects in succession

protwuns as compared with proper names 

§ i here use proper names in the ordinary sense 
of the grammarians meaning by it names like 
john london c 

what do they connote nothing 

what do they note or denote less than the 
pronouns and be it remembered that the pronouns 
denote but one real attribute 

how can a word that denotes less than a single 
real attribute denote anything at all this we 
must investigate we must investigate it in order 
to see in what respect the pronoun differs from the 
proper name 

the information that a proper name gives us is 
purely absolutely and exclusively negative what 
do i know of the individual called john from the 
combination john i guess that it means a 
human being of the male sex but this is only 
from knowing that it is to such objects that it 
generally applies it may mean a dog a horse a 
ship — anything 

all that the name reauy tells me is this viz that 
the object to which it applies bears that name or is 
supposed to bear it that it is not a thotnas a 
charles a london a julius goesar that it is not 
in short anything not called john or rather that it 
is not anything called by a name other than john 
certainly this is little enough yet more than this 
i am unable to find in the ordinary proper name it 
simply excludes so many others 

now this is what is done by the pronoun words

paets of speech 

like i and this c exclude words like thou and 
that c but they do something more they tell 
us something positive what i may mean altoge 
ther i cannot learn from the word itself it most 
probably means a humali being it is even chances 
that meaning a human being it means a person of 
the male sex but it may mean something dif 
ferent in sops fables it means a lion tiger 
dog fly c in homer it means gods goddesses 
demons c it may mean anything that any one 
may imagine to be endowed with speech and to 
use it in talking about itself nevertheless it 
means a speaker of some sort 

in like manner thou means an object spoken to 

again — this however little it may tell us as to 
the nature of the object that it denotes tells us that 
it is nearer to some speaker than the object desig

want to do so without violating the rules of lan 
guage 

there is something then common to the pro 
noun and the adjective something common not 
withstanding the substantival character of the former 
upon which so much has already been written 

to say 

the rose you speak of is redy 
and to say 

the rose you speak of is thisy 
is to utter a pair of exceedingly similar proposi 
tions propositions which agree in giving a certain 
attribute to a certain flower the first gives it 
that of redlness the second that of thisness 

yet there is a great difference in the import of 
the two predicates the foimer in giving us red 
tiessy gives us but one out of the many attributes 
that constitute the substance rose the latter in 
giving us thisnessy gives us the rose itself ie the 
selfsame substance under another name 

the name rose is the name of substance ie of 
the aggregate of so many attributes 

the name this is the name that that substance 
bears so long as it is in a certain relation to some 
other substance 

red is no name at all it is a word which sug 
gests or implies the name redness but when we 
have got this what is it it is no name for a rose 
but only a name for one of its qualities neither 
is it the name for the qualities of a rose exclusively

pronouns as cotnpared with abstracts 

a pronoun is the name for a substance 

it is the name of a substance based upon one 
and only one of its attributes 

but that attribute being the attribute of relation 
has the peculiar properties just indicated it applies 
to a whole substance and applies to any amount of 
different substances at different times 

in short as a name it is variable convertible 
temporary ephemeral momentary transferrible a 
name pro hdc vice so to say 

 the great majority of the substances to which 
pronouns apply are concrete i e when we come to 
know we find that though known only through 
one attribute they have many 

an abstraction is a substance with one attribute 
only i e the attribute which gives it its nam 
redness for instance is a substance of which we 
can only say in the way of predication that it is 
red 

it may be objected that this is no substance at 
all perhaps it is not etymologically it is cer 
tainly not so to the senses it is a substance how 
ever to the intellect and it is a substance in 
grammar it is something that the mind can con 
template m and by itself it is a something of 
which we may talk as we talk of the most concrete

criticism — use of the word noun 

§ if the doctrines of the preceding sections are 
true the existing phraseology of the ordinary gram 
mars is exceptionable complications arising out of 
the use of the word noun the effect of it is to 
separate the substantive too much from the pro 
noun and to connect it too closely with the adjec 
tive 

in the first place noun is derived from the latin 
nomen name but the present treatise denies that 
adjectives are names and gives reasons for the denial 

the present treatise maintains that a name im 
plies a nomine or object named now there is no 
nomine to an adjective it is no answer to this 
statement to say that white red old new szc are 
the names of substances things or objects they 
are not so white thing c are names but the 
nominal part lies in the word thing all that the 
words white c suggest is the existence of a 
certain attribute as one amongst others constituting 
a substance for this attribute as aforesaid white 
red c are not the true names the true names 
are whiteness redness c 

the exact form which the language of a gramma 
rian should take in order to obviate these diffi 
culties is by no means an easy question neither 
is it one which any single writer is likely to deter 
mine the practice of teaching along with the 
investigations necessary in the higher branches of

philology will sooner or later decide wliat portions 
of the present phraseology should be kept and 
what allowed to grow obsolete meanwhile it is 
convenient for the present to forget as much as 
possible the connection between the words noun and 
name — adjectives being nouns but not names it 
is also convenient to ignore as much as possible 
the element pro in the word pronoxm or at any 
rate forget that it means for this is needful be 
cause the pronoun is reauy as much of a noun as 
the substantive itself and more of one than the 
adjective to a certain extent it is doubtless a sub 
stitute every pronoun like every proper name has 
its eauivalent to every proper name there is the 
comihpn or general name of the dass to which the 
particular individual imder notice belongs thus 
wherever there is a john or a bvxieplmlua as usually 
understood there is a man or a liorse in like 
manner to every pronoun there is a corresponding 
substantive this and thxit always meaning some 
thing qiousey many c as the case may be though 
meaning it in a different manner 

as far then as this is substitution pronouns are 
substitutes for nouns but proper names are also 
substitutes for common ones be it so it follows 
that with a change of view nouns are substitutes 
for pronouns and common names for proper 

now the evil of making the noun the standard 
and the pronoun the substitute makeshift or 
shadow of the noun lies in the circumstance of its 
being extremely likely as a matter of fact in the 
history of language that the pronoun is in many 
instances the older word of the two the evidence 
upon this point lies within the domain of another

need more be said to show that in the eyes of 
iihe present writer at least the plurality or non 
plurality of attributes is of the highest importance 
jt makes all the difference between notation and 
connotation for the value of this the reader is 
referred to the work so often quoted mills logic 
vrhere the bearing of the latter upon language as 
an instrument of thought is fally but not too 
fully illustrated 

what however if we consider what may be 
called the thamedness of an object an attribute in 
such a case the true and typical proper name like 
john or london instead of being a word which 
gives us no attribute at all is the name of an object 
¦with a name — the name itself or rather the fact of the 
name being borne by it being if not an actual attri 
bute an approach to one if this be the case every 
object that has a name has ipso facto an attribute 

considering then the possession of a name as 
one attribute it follows that words like thou 
this c which over and above the fact of their 
being named give us a relation as well may be 
said to have two and having two to be connota 
tive at any rate they are names implying a second 
attribute 

i submit that as far as this is an objection it is 
one easily remedied should need be by a slight 
change in the termiuology the material fact of 
names that give us a relation being different from 
names that give us neither a relation nor anything 
equivalent to it stiq remains

cording to the view taken in our preceding section 
of the import of names like john and london

quantity except that whatever it may be in other 
points of view it is in the eyes of a grammarian an

in all the numerals and pronouns are noticed to

the attribute of quantity — cardincds and 
ordinals 

§ the relation however between the cardinal

it most nearly resembles that of words like this

the other compare such a series as jtrst second

familiar abbreviation or this that and yon and 
the extent to which both have the character of 
ordinality is manifest first second third is a 
sequence of which the words nearest not so near 
and furtjter give almost a translation and what 
are these but this that and yon imder another 
form the relations in space are identical 

again — like this that and you the words first 
second and third imply the existence of a substance 
to which they correspond these are truly names 
though convertible this however we have learnt 
abeady from their place as pronouns

however the points in which they agree that 
here like ims implies a closer and there like that 
a less dose proximity is obvious and they imply 
it in the same way this and that attach them 
selves to substances jiere and there to certain points 
in space the objects occupying those points making 
no part of the idea and this is the case with one 
and tvx 

if this view be accurate the cardinal numbers 
are more or less adverbial in character be it so 
they may be this and yet retain much of their 
pronominal character but they are adjectival also 
we can say one man two men c just as we can 
a few men many men equally adjectival are 
here and there words which etymologically speak

to this extent then the relation between the 
cardinality and ordinality of the numerals is pecu

it were so the phenomenon which the numeration 
of i believe every language on the face of the 
earth would exhibit would be most anomalous it 
would exhibit a reversal of the very general rule 
that the abstract is derived from the concrete and 
not the concrete from the abstract inasmuch as in

in one respect indeed there is actually an abstrac

number imnus any particular object to which it 
applies the ordinal on the other hand has always 
something with which it concerns itself neither 
relation however is the relation of red to redness 
or redness to red on the contrary both the cardi 
nals and the ordinal may if necessary take each 
their own proper abstract we may talk of the 
captain of a class in school being proud of his first 
ness just as the second may be said to be vain of 
his forwardness

the indefinite article having grown out of the nu 
meral and the french le ille the definite 
article having grown out of the demonstrative 
pronoun — oftener called the personal pronoun of 
the third person but reauy the demonstrative 

neither was the french process of evolution or 
development peculiar the articles of all the allied 
languages arose out of these same pronouns unu 
and ille only however in wauachian did it 
follow the noun this is sufficient to show that 
in one respect at least the article is if no fuu 
and true pronoun at least pronominal in its origin 
should however the instances fiom the tongues 
just cited be held insufficient it may be added 
that mutatis mutandis the origin of the articles 
in the languages allied to our own is the same

the demonstrative this or tjiat what is a but 
an and an but an anglosaxon and ane scotch

the points in which it agrees with the pronoun 
those in which it differs fiom the pronoun are at 
least of equal interest 

a pronoun is essentially categorematic if it 
were not so it would not be a pronoun 

an article is essentially sjricategorematic if it 
were not so it would not be an article 

an article is sjticategorematic at least and in 
many cases it is something more it not only at

word as has been suggested in § and as the 
name indicates 

such being the case the impropriety of putting 
the article at the head of the list of the parts of 
speech as is done in many grammars is apparent 
separated from the pronoun out of which it origi 
nates and connected with the substantive adjective 
or noim with which its real relations are only in 
direct it is quite out of place only taking its 
proper position when in contact with the pro 
noun 

pronominal however as it is it is still syti 
categorematic and so being supplies an instance 
of a part of speech losing its categorematic cha 
racter and becoming something else how is this 
done the first point to be remembered is the 
fact of every pronoun having a synonym i e a 
substantive into which it may be translated every 
this is this something — this man this stone c 
now when the two names are thus joined the 
result is a substance plus its relations 

let the two ideas so far combine that the two 
words which form them partake of the nature of a 
compound 

let one of the words undergo a change of form 
the result of which will be that the word in com 
bination with the substantive will be slightly dif 
ferent from what it is when separate and indepen 
dent 

the result too wiu be that out of the root of this 
and that we get the a word incapable of existing 
by itself but common enough under the name of 
the definite article in conjunction with a substan

under the title of article as thus explained l e what are 
the words in english which are at one and the same 
time 

a pronominal in origin and 

 incapable of existing except in conjunction with 

 either a substantive or some other pronoun 

answer — an or a and the 

question — are there any others 

answer — not in the ordinary grammars more than 
one competent writer however has suggested that no is 
an article to be this it must of course be considered 
as different in its construction from the ordinary negative 
in which case it certainly comes under the conditions of 
an article it has no independent existence it has an 
existence when coupled with a substantive or another 
pronoun it not one and none in power but we 
can by no means use it as we can those words categore 
matically it seems in short to be truly articular 

question — are there any others 

answer — the construction of every is exactly the con 
struction of no we can say every man as we can say no 
man and every one as we can say no one but we cannot 
say every and no alone 

question — what do you say to many a and never a 
in such phrases as manyaone and neveraone are they 
articular 

nsujr— certainly but they are simply the indefinite 
a with a certain prefix every ever ilk each is 
in a different category it is not only articular but a

the recognition of every and no as articles are 
measures of the extent to which the previous doc 
trine as to the essential characteristics of the article 
alters the phraseology of the ordinary grammars 

it now only remains to ask what are the logical 
conditions which more particularly evolve or de 
velope the article for these we may look to 
§ 

 every expresses a universal aflsrmative 

 no a universal negative 

 a and tlie the particular affirmative the 
former indefinitely the latter definitely 

dialogue 
question — are there no articles except those that ex 
press the quantity and quality of propositions 

answer — the words that express the quantity and 
quality of propositions an and the by the way do this 
and something more are the chief at the same time 
there are others though we can say 

this hat is miney 
we cannot say 

this hat is my 
so that my thy our and your are articular in respect to 
their construction — articular in construction and pro 
nominal in origin if not actual articles they are closely 
akin to them

not the subject of a proposition is called an ad

the abstract substantive

arrive at it by attending to certain shades of mean 
ing illustrated by the following sentences — 
ice is solid water 
water is liquid ice 
each of these is not only correctly constructed 
as a proposition but is true as a matter of fact 
take the two together and what do they imply 
change— change from solidity to liquidity at any 
rate change of some kind how is this change 
effected does the water in becoming ice change 
itself from a liquid to a solid does the ice in 
becoming water change itself from a solid to a 
liquid or are some fresh agents brought in by 
which water is solidified and ice liquified say 
that there are and that these agents are heat and 
cold and we get the proposition that 

heat is the cause of ice becoming water 

and 
cold is the cause of water becoming ice 
so that now we get the idea not only of change 
but of agency 

and now for solid and liquid water write 
solidified and liquified 

ice is solidified water 
water is liquified ice 
ice is water solidified by cold 
water is ice liquified by heat 
fio in latin means i become hence solidi 
fied and liquified mean hecomesolid and become 
liquid the abstract names that correspond to 
these two words are solidifiation the becoming

fication and the other in faction why not say 
either solidifaction and liquifactiouy or liquidifi 
cation and solidification there is no great 
reason why we should not the difference be 
tween a thing becotnvng solid or liquid and 
beingtnade solid or liquid is rarely of much 
importance in ordinary language both expres 
sions however suggest the idea of change one 
the idea of change effected spontaneously by the 
object itself the other the idea of change impressed 
upon it from without 

now solid and liquid are adjectives whereas 
solidified and liquified are participles whilst soli 
dify and liquify are verbs this shows the ex 
tent to which adjectives participles and verbs are 
allied 

they are auied but different and the difference 
between them consists in the idea of change and 
agency implied by the participle and the verb 
solidity is a state solidification an action yet 
the solidity of water in the shape of ice and the 
solidification which water undergoes in order to 
become ice are equally attributes of water 

for liquify write thxiw

to the right of each write the water is thus 
the water is liquid 
the water is thawed 

from thawed eject the ed and substitute for it

the adjective has become first a participle after 
wards a verb 

how by changing the state expressed by the 
word liquid into the action denoted by the word 
liquified 

the slightest departure imaginable fiom the ex 
pression by which we denote the permanent state 
or condition of an object has this effect to say 
that 

water has the property of liquidity 
water is endowed with liquidity 
water becomes solid under certain circum 
stances 
water can become solid 
and the like is to make water the substance more 
or less of an agent and its attribute more or less 
of an action 

to have the attribute of liquidity is to act the 
part of a possessor or owner 

to be endowed with the same is to be acted 
upon by some imaginary endower 

to become anything is to pass fiom one state to 
another through one or more intermediate ones 

the water that can become solid has certain 
powers — no matter whether exercised or not 

and so on through a whole list of similar ex 
pressions 

except when we mentioned the words heat and 
cold we have hitherto spoken as i in the changes 
imder notice it was the water that was the agent 
but what if instead of saying 

water becomes ice 
we say 

water is made into ice

paets of speech 

in such a case water is anything but an agent 
on the contrary it is extremely passive the agent 
being elsewhere in propositions like — 
cold chauges water into ice 
cold freezes water 
cold solidifies water 
we get the agent in question — the agent which at 
the first view appears to make the ice yet it 
only makes it through the action of the water 

however the agency is now complete and we 
have both the cause cold acting on water and the 
effect solidification we have also the substances 
— ice water and cold — as well as the attributes 
viz solidity liquidity power of being changed 
from liquid to solid and vice versd power of 
changing c the cold acts upon the water pro 
ducing a result 

now this action proceeding from the cold effects 
a result in the water — passing or making a tromsit 
so to say from the one to the other the action 
energy manifestation of power or whatever we 
choose to call it is now at its tnaodmum this is 
the case with the class of verbs called transitive 
there is the agent and the object and there is the 
relation between the two the ordinary conditions 
of a state a word implying permanence are wholly 
absent the only state in the matter is a state of 
change and this is scarcely a state at au 

where the verb is transitive the term is many 
worded for a transitive verb implies the existence 
of some object upon which it acts and a transitive 
verb imaccompanied by a name is a contradiction 
in terms the absence of such a name renders it 
intransitive even though in form it be transitive

in an action rather than a state 

like the adjective the participle is predicatively

exceptions that constitute language but all terms 
are not simple and the existence in language of 
complex ones creates the occasion for other classes 
of words or other parts of speech there exist 
in language parts of speech or classes of words 
for the admission whereof into propositions a cer 
tain degree of complexity in either the subject or 
predicate is a condition these parts of speech or 
classes of words are two in number — adverbs and 
prepositions 



 

adverbs 

§ a word inadmissible in a simple but admissible 
in a complex term and therein requiring the pre 
sence of only a single categorematic or hypercate 
gorematic element is called an adverb 
john is speaking loudly 
john speaks loudly 

all words that can take the place of loudly in a 
proposition are adverbs 

but — 

a verb predicate copula 

add to which that 

it is its predicative or adjectival element which 
is modified by the adverb a part of speech which 
is really as much of an sbdadjective as an sdverb 

adverbs give the tnanner or mode in which the 
action denoted by the verb takes place of these 
there are several species inasmuch as not only the 
general character and degree of an action come 
under the denomination of a tnode but the con

ditions of time and place as well along with others 
of less importance 

he speaks 

he speaks loudly 

he speaks very degree loudly 

he speaks very loudly now time 

he spoke hhere place 

from modus mode we have the logical 
terms modal and modality terms by which we 
express the function of the adverbs 

for an adverb to find its place in a proposition 
all that is necessary is a word denoting some action 
to which the idea of the manner in which or the 
conditions under which it takes place is added 

 

prepositions 

§ a syncategorematic word requiring for its in 
troduction into a term two or more categorematic 
elements those being subjective is called a pre 
position 

hence — 

prepositions connect subjectives when more than 
one of them occurs in a term 

in such an expression as am come from london 
by way of windsor and am going to bristol 
through bath all words which can take the place 
of from to of and through are prepositions 

pre before positio a placing or position 
now although words like from to c in the 
currentlystudied languages precede their subjec

necessity that they should do so indeed in many

languages they follow if so the socalled pro 
position is really a jposposition jposb after 

hence the term preposition though current is 
exceptionable being too specific 

observe — the inconvenience of the ordinary 
classification into nouns containing substantives 
and adjectives and pronouns is made manifest by 
a sentence of this section — prepositions connect 
pronouns and subjectives c some more familiar 
term was wanted here to have said that prepo 
sitions connected nouns would have been wrong 
inasmuch as adjectives are nouns and adjectives 
except so fiir as they are attached to some substan 
tive or pronoun are not parts of speech to which 
a pronoun can attach itself 

to have said that prepositions connected pro 
nouns would also have been wrong the state 
ment would have been too narrow they connect 
substantives as well 

it would also have been wrong to have said 
that they connected substantives they also con 
nect pronouns 

as soon as we understand the fact of prepositions 
indicating a relation wo see the impossibility of 
their finding a place either in a simple term or in 
a term containing only one name for a relation 
to exist there must be at least two related objects 

 

conjunctions 

§ a word which connects either two terms of 
the same kind within the same proposition or else 
two propositions is called a conjunction

parts of speech 

mark the words of the same hind the copula 
connects two terms viz the subject and predicate 
but these are not of the same kind

all men are black or white 
the conjunction or connects hiaak and white — both 
predicates 
in— 

the day is bright 

because 
the sun is shining 
the conjunction because connects two propositions 

conjunctions are extraterminal i e they lie 
beyond the term 

conjunctions are extraterminal nevertheless 
though they lie beyond the boundaries of any 
single term they imply the existence of two

that of the usual works on grammar it has been 
more than once suggested that such is actually the 
case more than once has the reader been re 
minded that the tests or criteria by which the 
parts of speech of the present treatise are deter 
mined are in some degree peculiar yet they are 
by no means either very doubtfiil or very obscure 
why then are they either wholly absent or imper 
fectly exhibited in the usual works upon language 
have the grammarians overlooked them altogether 
or has the present writer overlooked certain facts 
that modify their application 

the answer to this involves the consideration of 
the phenomena of what is called inflection 

firstly that of the term itself — let a word be 
changed in respect to its form and let these 
changes be compared to the bends of a trained tree 
only instead of the english word bending let us 
use the latin term inflectio from fledo bendy 
and say that certain words under certain condi 
tions are inflected or exhibit inflections 

next let us consider the functions of a preposi 
tion it is clear that the words so called are 
raierely so many means to an end that end being 
the expression of certain relations between certain 
substantives and pronouns — certain substantives 
and pronouns sometimes single sometimes con 
joined with or attended by an adjective of 
these means there may certainly be more than one 
sort at any rate we know of no necessity for the 
expression of the relation in question being limited 
to one form we may make this clear by taxing 
our ingenuity in the formation of an artificial lan

guage one of the conditions of which should be 
that there should be no prepositions we may do 
it more easily still by simply comparing such sl 
pair of words as fathers son with the three words 
son of father in the former the appended sound 
of the final s does the work tliere or thereabouts 
of the word of in the latter and why can we 
not go further why not sy fatheri father o fathert 
or something of the same sort for to fatlter why 
not say fatherl or fathera for from father and so 
on the answer to this question is that it is not 
the custom of the men and women who speak 
english to do so that the latins however did 
so is well known so did the greeks so did 
our own ancestors to some extent in latin — 



pater father 
patris fathers 
patri to father 



patres fathers 
patrwn of fathers 
patribus to fathers 

that there ia a broad difference between the 
system which gives us such a single word as patri 
and the system which gives us such a combination 
as to a father is dear and it ia highly probable 
that with such a difference existing there is also a 
name by which it is expressed 

what is this name like many others it will 
involve a metaphor the idea which gives us the 
names for such a form as patri c is the idea of fall 
ing or declming from an upright position an idea 
which brings us to such terms as case from casus 
 and declension from declino decline 

let father in english and pater in latin be the 
original categorematic forms — forms capable of

parts of speech 

baaking either the subjects or predicates of pro 
positions hy themselves 

let fathers and patris be considered to be the 
same words though in a less upright independent 
position in short let us call them fallvngsoff 
from the original only instead of fallingsoffy let 
xls use the latin word case 

patris and fathers wiu then be cases of pcuer 
ond father and — 

the system that gives us the series pater patris 
patri will be a system of what is called declen 
sion 

carry the metaphor still fiirther let an up 
right line represent pater and let the several slants 
it would give in falling represent the cases 

 

father — pater 

 
fathers — patris 

patri 




no is upright in reality it is no case or 
falling at all it is customary however to call it 
the casus eectus or upright case and inaccurate 
as the expression is it is not very inconvenient 

nos and are oblique i e oblique cases 
and so they are called in grammar 

certain inflections are the equivalents to prepo 
sitions 

a categorematic word plus the equivalent to a

 parts of speech 

preposition is in the same predicament with a cate 
gorematiq word plus a preposition itself sach a 
word as patris can no more form a term than such 
a combination as of a father 

and this explains a common statement in books 
of logic viz that it is only nouns in the casus 
rectus that are categorematic in an oblique case 
a noun for all its importance and all its otherwise 
categorematic character can only be the part of a 
term 

 

inflection — nwmber 

§ the previous section has shown that the rela 
tion which two words in the same term bear to 
each other may be expressed by declension instead 
of by separate words in the shape of prepositions 

are there any other modifications of meaning 
which may be expressed either by the same or 
similar means 

we have seen that there are the diflference 
between pater and patres between fiither and 
fathers is a difference of number 

 

inflection — oender 

§ in latin doniinus master whilst domina 
 mistress and this difference of form as indica 
tive of a difference of sex is carried throughout 
the cases and numbers 

dominus a master 

dominoy to a master

parts of speech 

as opposed to— 

lormna a mistress 

domvnoby of a mistress 

dominarum of mistresses c 
this difference is a difference of gender 



 

inflection — gender — of prorumns 

§ in ordinary substantives the phenomenon of 
gender is of no great importance 

but it exists in pronouns also where it modifies 
the statements of §§ 

in latin ille he whereas the form for she is 
ilia 

what do these words tell us they tell us that 
the object to which they apply is in a certain rela 
tion to the speaker i e that it is the object spoken 
ofy rather than the object speaking or the object 
spoken to 

but they tell us something more they teu us 
that the object designated by ille is a male the 
object designated by ilia being a female 

now the sex of an object is not only one of its 
attributes but it is one of its qualities if so 
pronoims expressive of sex are pronouns and some 
thing more ie pronouns with an adjectival power 
superadded

this is the expression of a difference of degree 
by either a declension or something akin to it at

inflection of verbs — conjugation 

§ like nouns and pronouns verbs are inflected 
the time past present or future at which an 
action takes place and the agent does it the 
speakety the object spoken to or the object spoken 
ofy being the chief elements in the complex idea 



in latin —

tecau

of the phenomena of inflection traversing compk 
cating and modifying the doctrine founded upon a 
basis exclusively logical 

the close relations that logically exist between the 
verb and noun have already been noticed §§ — 
 what however would be the effect of a 
verb on one side being so fiilly conjugated and a 
noun on the other being so fully declined as for 
neither of them to appear without some sign of 
either their nominal or verbal character attached to 
and inseparably connected with it the logical 
affinity would be concealed by the inflectional dif 
ferences 

now this is no imaginary case in english the 
word envy is either a verb or a novn and we may 
say either envy him or look upon hvra with 
eyes of envy 

in greek the syllable fihon jov has the same 
power between however the greek language 
and the english there is this difference the former 
never uses the syllable fthon by itself if it be 
nominal in its power it has certain inflections

if it be verbal a verbal inflection is assigned to it 

no noun in greek ends in ein many verbs 
do indeed ein is a verbal or conjugational in 
flection and by no means a nominal or declensional 
one what however if a word so ending take the 
place in a proposition of a substantive there is

to a certain extent a conflict between the logical 
and formal teste 

and this really exists the combination to 
fthonein to ooveiv envy the substantive 
yet it has the outward signs of a verb and a 
verb it is if we look to the form only look 
however to the meaning and it is a noun 

that this complication would be abolished if we 
abrogated the inflections is dear since such a word 
as fthon might like envy as easily be a noun as a 
verb but on the other hand it might as easily 
be a verb as a noun for a word with no charac 
teristic signs at all may be anything or everything 
as a part of speech in i go up the word up is 
an adverb in go up the tree it is a preposi 
tion 

separated from its inflections the root fthon 
would have been what we may call indifferent 
ie would have been like the word up a word as 
capable of being one part of speech as another 
this indeed is the case with the word lately 
quoted — envy it has nothing about it more 
nominal than verbal or more verbal than nomi 
nal 

 

determination of forms by inflection 

the smaller the amount of inflection the greater 
the number of indifferent words ie words like 
up and envy as opposed to fthonos and fthorvein 
which may be called determinoue

criticism 

without going further into these details we may 
see from the little already written that the gram 
marian who undertook the arrangement of the 
parts of speech according to the logical properties 
of the words of the language under notice might 
find his classification traversed by the apparent 
contradictions suggested by their inflectional forms 
and such has actually been the case the etymo 
logical test has been opposed to the logical and 
vice versa 

it is maintained however by the present writer 
that this antagonism is apparent rather than real 
it is held too that even if it were more real than 
it is it would affect but a small portion of the wide 
field of language in languages where inflections are 
rare and the forms of the words indifferent the 
etymological difficulty has no existence there being 
no formal test by which the logical can be tra 
versed and even in languages where inflections 
are abundant the only parts of speech which can 
create any difficulty are the verbs and nouns — 
these being the only two in which any notable 
amount of inflection occurs the extent however 
to which a verb is allied to the noim has already 
been exhibited 

it is undoubtedly true that in such a sentence as 
they spoke the idea is wholly verbal but abstract 
from it the ideas of the agents expressed by they 
and look upon the action without regard to the 
time in which it occurred and the idea becomes

that of the act of speaking in general an idea 
purely substantive in like manner — 

to ervy is human to forgive divine 
gives us the truly substantive ideas of — 

error is human forgiveness divine 
instances of this kind could be multiplied if 
necessary ad injinitum enough however has 
been written to show that the difference between 
the logical and inflectional tests is less real than ap 
parent that a word expressive of the same idea 
may sometimes appear as a pure verb sometimes as a 
participle and sometimes as in the infinitive mood 
the gerunds and supines as a substantive is ad 
mitted in all grammars — though not perhaps so 
explicitly as it should be 



 

pronxmns and participles as compared with 
substantives and adjectives 

§ to proceed it has been the object of the 
preceding sections to show that — 

all words forming different portions of a propo 
sition are different parts of speech 

is the converse of this true is it true that — 

all words forming the same parts of a proposi 
tion are the same parts of speech 

not according to the present classification a 
pronoim takes the same place in a proposition as a 
substantive and a participle as an adjective ne 
vertheless pronouns and participles are separate 
parts of speech of course this may be altered 
by altering the definition of the term partof

be done 

the difference of idea conveyed by a participle 
as contrasted with the ordinary adjective and the 
pronoun as compared with the substantive has 
already been explained it is the diflference be 
tween an action and a state a quality and a re

recapitulation 

to recapitulate — words fall into two primary 
divisions — 

i those that are wholly independent of propo 
sitions and 

ii those whose existence depends upon the ex 
istence of a proposition 

the former class contains the interjections only 

the second falls into three divisions the jirst 
containing such words as yes and no i is so 
and it is not so words equivalent to a whole propo 
sition they are answers to questions and as such 
imply the existence of a previous proposition 

the second contains the conjunctions words 
whose place lies between two terms but not m 
any term at all these terms must be of the 
same kind ie either subjects or predicates they 
need not however be within the same proposition 
indeed they rarely are so if so conjunctions are 
of two kinds — 

intertermvnal or between the terms of the one 
and the same proposition e g all men are black or 
white

propositions e g —

because

of copuuis or words that connect different 
terms ie the subject with the predicate — there is 
no instance in language consequently there is no 
such part of speech as the copula the word that 
serves as a copula is always a copula and predicate 
beside for the explanation of the apparent para 
dox see § 

the third and most important class contains 
those words which enter into the structure of 
terms sometimes by forming whole ones sometimes 
by forming parts of ones and sometimes by form 
ing terms and something more these are as 
follows — 

verb particles 

nouns hypercate syncategore 

categorematic gorematie matic

pronoun substantive adjective participle verb adverb

the reasons of the several places of the above 
named classes of words are by no means obscure 
and they are often given in the ordinary grammars 
with sufficient perspicuity 

nothing but the name of a substance either 
really existing or capable of being perceived by 
the senses or conceived by the imagination can 
form the subject of a proposition 

this is expressed in the current grammatical

definition of a substantive as the name of any 
thing we can see hear feel or discourse of i e 
reason about 

such a substance must either possess or be without 

certain attributes e g it must either be white or 

not white hence any word which suggests the 

name of an attribute may form a predicate e g — 

snow is white 

soot is not white 

but we may also predicate of any substance 
that it may be equal to or identical with an 
other e g — 

a man is an animal 

a bird is not a quadruped 

this shows that the name of a substance may 
enter into the structure of a proposition either as 
subject or as predicate 

every object or entity must be endowed with 
certain qualities or attributes e g snow is white 
— man is mortal that the names of such qualities 
or attributes can become the predicates of proposi 
tions has been shown above 

in order however for it to be a subject it must 
be something more than a word suggestive of a 
name it must be the name itself 

with substantives the name denotes the object 
directly 

with pronouns it denotes it indirectly i e 
through its relations 

verbs express actions implying that a certain 
object comports itself in such and such a manner 
it is something or it does something or it suffers 
something so run the usual expositions of the 
meaning of the word verb

nothing but a word of this kind can be at once 
predicate and copula the predicate element de 
notes the particular state or action the copula 
element its existence or to speak more generally 
its applicability or nonapplicability to the subject 

in order for a proposition to be simple its terms 
must be simple 

the only sorts of words which can be admitted 
into complex terms are words which either express 
st the relation that two or more nouns bear to 
one another or ndly the mode or manner in 
which states or actions take place and it follows 
from hence that the only words admissible into a 
term where there is but otie noun or nominal ele 
ment must be words expressive of the mode or 
manner of a state or action words of this kind 
are called adverbs because the predicate with 
which they combine generally coalesces with the 
copula and becomes a verb 

the only other class of words must consist of 
those that denote the relation that one out of two 
or more nouns in a term bears to the others 

this explains the nature of adverbs and preposi 
tions 

when the words that find their places within 
the limits of a term have been exhausted we come 
to the conjunctions that belonging to no single 
term connect two

to its import for it is certainly a relation that it 
expresses but its place in a proposition is that of 
a syncategorematic and not a categorematic word 

its true relations are found in the remarks upon 
the wauachian and icelandic languages in § 
wherein it is shown to coalesce with the substan 
tive and to become not only a part of a terrriy but 
also a part of a word in such a condition it 
partakes of the nature of an inflection so that a 
substantive plus an article is in much the same 
condition as a substantive plus the equivalent of a 
preposition 

the question now arises as to whether inflections 
can be called parts of speech 

they are not called so at present however much 
they may be equivalent to them 

nevertheless it is safe to cau an article a avh 
inflectional word — ie a word which without being 
actually an inflection approaches one

the english languae by dr r la 
tham frs fourth edition vols vo £ cloth 

in the present enlarged edition the first volume is occupied chiefiy with discus 
sions on the german origin of the english language the student of english 
philology will here find ample details connecting the foundations of old english 
speech— • the wells of english undefiled— with the continental languages of 
ancient times by copious irroofs from classical and antiquarian sources the 
author defines the geographical and ethnological limits within which each ger 
manic dialect was spoken and in this particular the work presents what may be 
called a philological geography of germany tracing the areas occupied by the 
several teutonic races the student of german and anglosaxon is thus directed 
to the authentic sources of the knowledge conveyed to him in the copious dis 
sertations on the affinities of early english with its motherdialects which he 
will find in the work in this section much curious information is given respect 
ing the initial and final forms and the other variations of appellatives ana the 
origin of many names of persons and places is traced 

the varieties of idiom originating in diflferent provinces are exemplified by 
quotations and specimens from each country and period to enable the student to 
account for the stages the relations and the divergency of english peculiarities 
derived from a multitude of other languages the student is introduced to com 
parisons with the dutch the highgerman the danish the swedish the norse 
and the icelandic languages there are also disquisitions accompanied with 
extended specimens on the british and gaelic branches of the keltic stock of 
languages comprehending the cornish welsh armorican irishgaelic scotch 
gaelic and manks tongues a separate chapter relates to english affinities trace 
able in the greek latin italian piedmontese spanish catalonian portuguese 
french vaudois romanese enghadin rumango provincial french provencal

contains a view of provincial forms of speech at present existing amongst others 
the peculiarities of somersetshire devonshire gloucestershire dorsetshire the 
isle of wight lancashire cumberland northumberland yorkshire derbyshire 
cheshire stafford and the eastern counties there is also a section on ameri

on the whole the inspector of these volumes in glancing at the contents and 
turning over the leaves can scarcely fail to conceive the impression that they 
contain an encyclopaedia of information on the origin the lawl the peculiarities 
and the powers of the english language whether regarded in a popular or in a

less elaborate than that work it is less elementary than the english grammar 
like all the other works by the same author it gives great prominence to the 
ethnological relations of our tongue and insists upon historical investigation and 
the application of the general principles of comparative philology as the true 
means of exhibiting its real growth and structure in opposition to the more usual 
method of treating it as a mass of irregularities it has the further object of 
supplying a knowledge of those laws of speech and principles of grammar which

an elementary ennrlish grammar for the

fellow of kings college cambridge sixth edition 
lmo cloth 

the object of thii work is to ut down the prhicipl of english grammar as dis 
tinffubhed firom mere rules these principles are red by surveying the origin 
ana growth of the language and particularly th several steps of the transition 
from the inflected character of its a iglosaxcm stage to its present uninflected 
structure the student in the middle and hier classes of schools for whom the 
work is chiefly intended is made acquaintcn with the connection of the various 
branches of the great gothic stock of languages and by learning the history of 
his own tongue and its relations to the dialects with which it is connected ac 
quires the elements of the general phikriogical classiflcation of languages the 
book presents him with new and numerous facts and habituates him to reasoning 
upon them and while the work can be wholly mastered independently of any 
knowledge of either of the classical languages as much logic is given as is necessary 
to explain the structure of propositions 

some of the peculiarities of the grammar consist in a minute analysis of the 
powers of the letters whether single or combined in the comparison of irregular 
inflexions with obsolete cognate words in tracing the laws and forms of the 
derivation of words and in a treatise on the varieties of english verse and their 
representation hy symbolical formulas 

 it is a work m which grammar no longer an assemblage of conventional rules 
of speech becomes a philosophical analysis of our language and an elementary 
intellectual exercise adapted to the highest purposes of instruction — minutes of

 instead of a mere dry classification of words and rules often difficult to be 
understood it gives a pnilosophical view of the whole subject and yet with so 
much clearness as to assist the reason no less than the memorv the first part 
gives the history of our language and traces its formation from the german tribes 
who successively conquered and settled in our island in the third part which 
treats of dederwion and conjugation the connection of these subjects with the 
rules of euphony is shown in a very lucid and interesting manner we think this 
little work will prove a boon to mothers and instructors and invest with interest

phical systems particularly in connection with the euphonic changes which arise 
from the combination of letters the logical structure of propositions isr then 
briefly explained and this introductory matter is followed by the usual declen
