preface 

the following essay was written exclusively from 
the notes which i took while attending sir william 
hamiltons class in that being the only ses 
sion during which i ever attended his logical course 
as a student 

it has thus a certain value though this be but 
shght as evidence that sm w hamilton then 
taught his new doctrine so clearly that it might 
be readily apprehended in all its essential points 
by an ordinary student in order therefore that 
it may not lose any accidental value which it pos 
sesses on this account the essay is pubhshed as it 
was originally written i should not indeed have 
felt myself at libert even on other grounds to have 
altered it accordingly with the single excep 

¦ were it necessary abundant evidence might be at once ob 
tained to prove that sir w hamilton taught his new doctrine five 
years earlier than the above date

tion of a somewhat fuller statement of the three 
canons of figure pages it is printed with 
out alteration as at first given in for competition 
a few footnotes have been added while it was 
going through the press these are distinguished 
from the original notes of the essay by being placed 
within brackets some historical details too touch 
ing the doctrine which the essay expounds have 
been given in the form of an appendix these de 
tails though presenting little attraction to those 
who have only a general acquaintance with logical 
science will i hope be found of some interest to 
its more advanced students 

the few definitions and canons which occur 
through the essay and which are marked with 
inverted commas are given from my notes of the 
lectures they are i believe substantially correct 
but as the notes are in many places brief and im 
perfect i cannot vouch for their verbal accuracy 
the requirements originally prescribed for the essay 
are reprinted with it as they to some extent explain 
the form which it assumed 

although at the time when the prize was awarded 
sir william hamilton had suggested to me that 



feeface ix 

the essay was of sufficient general interest for pub 
lication still i naturally felt that in the event of 
being printed it would be more satisfactory both to 
the public and to myself to receive some formal con 
firmation of this indeed as the essay is mainly de 
voted to the exposition of sir w hamiltons new 
doctrine i should not for a moment have enter 
tained the idea of publishing it at all without his ex 
press sanction accordingly when i first thought 
of doing so i applied to sir w hamilton for this 
purpose and received from him the following note 
for the kindness of which i need scarcely say i feel 
personally indebted —

 my dear mr baynes — so far from having any 
objection to the publication of your logical essay 
the intention has my fullest approval when i first 
perused that essay it seemed to me not only pre 
eminently entitled to the annual prize for which it 
was written but well deserving of the attention of 
logical readers in general this i probably ex 
pressed to you at the time and having now ob 
tained all the highest honours in philosophy proper 
which our university offers to her alumni i am 
happy to learn that you propose printing that essay 
in its original form with the addition of relative

matters furnished by your subsequent thought and 
reading i am acquainted with no one who has 
more zealously — more unexclusively followed out his 
philosophical and in particular his logical researches 
your supplement cannot therefore fail to be at once 
curious and important i would say that any infor 
mation from me is at your service were i not aware 
that you are laudably desirous to limit your addi 
tions to your own resources i shall only request 
the annexation of a note principally for the purpose 
of showing in what respect my present views may 
differ from those of mine stated by you in the essay 
— beheve me c 

i have only further to return my best thanks to 
sir w hamilton for his constant kindness in facili 
tating my inquiries giving me free access to his 
library for works which i could not otherwise have 
obtained and in various other ways affording me 
the benefit of his invaluable counsel and assistance

the main principle on which the new analytic of 
logical forms proceeds is that of a thoroughgoing 
quantification of the predicate this principle in its 
full scientific significance has been totally overlooked 
by logicians and when noticed at all has for the 
most part been referred to only to be discarded as 
useless if not to be condemned as false in conse 

 dico signum esse addendum subjecto nunquam prsedicato si 
enim in propositione universali affirmativa signura universale addas 
praedicato falsa erit propositio ut omnis homo est omne animal 
si vero in universali negativa signum universale itemque particulari 
sive affirmativa fuerit sive negativa signum particulare addideris

this is the tradition touching the express quantification of the pre 
dicate almost universally prevalent in the aristotelic schools and 
commentaries as will be more fully shown in the appendix the 
regulce philosophicce of stahl however from which it is taken is an 
acute and valuable work faithful to its title and containing more 
learning and philosophy than could readily even in the works of his

quence of this omission logic as a formal science has 
received only a onesided development — has been 
deprived of much that is scientifically true — encum 
bered with much that is scientifically false and 

time be found within the same compass it long maintained a very 
high reputation and was often reprinted both on the continent and 
in this country the first edition was published in the second 
in another in several others followed which were re 
printed at london and oxford and finally a revised edition appeared 
in with notes by the elder thomasius who was the master of 
leibnitz from having thus ascertained more accurately the dates of 
the earlier editions of this work i can now state with confidence 
what i had before surmised viz that it contains at least a partial 
anticipation of the distinction which was for the first time fully taken 
and established in modern philosophy by the portroyal logicians — 
the distinction to wit in notions of the two wholes or quantities 
the comprehensive and the extensive in answer to the question how 
the wider predicate comes to be in its narrower subject or what is 
the same thing how the whole essence of the genus comes to be in 
the species the author says esse praedicatum in aliquo subject© 
totum seu universaliter potest dupliciter accipi primo intetisive seu 
ratione essentice et sic animal totum inest homini et sic quodvis prae 
dicatum superius inest inferiori secundo extensive seu ratione la 
titudinis ut hie accipitur et sic animal non inest totum seu univer 
saliter in homine quia animal non totum comprehenditur ab ipso 
ita ut extra ipsum non sit reg phil p the contrasted 
character of these counter quantities the intensive as the quantity 
of essence the extensive as the quantity of extent is here given with 
even scientific precision many of the older logicians say in general 
after aristotle that in one sense the species is in the genus and 
in another the genus in the species but i have not found any state 
ment of this distinction before the time of the portroyalists at all 
so precise and explicit as that given in the above passage daniel 
stahl beside the regulce was the author of a number of other works 
on logic metaphysics and ethics he was professor of philosophy 
in the university of jena and died in the year after having 
occupied the chair thirtyone years witteni memorice p 



new analytic of logical forms 

throughout its entire history exhibited in a per 
verted and erroneous form on the principle of 
a quantified predicate however past evils are cor 
rected past omissions supplied and logic receives 
its highest development in the perfection and sim 
phcity of its form to exhibit some of the more 
immediate improvements thus effected by the apph 
cation of this principle is the design of the following 
essay in seeking to accomplish this there will be — 

i a statement and application of the fundamental 
postulate of logic from which application there arises 
the principle of an expressed quantification of the 
predicate 

ii the application of this principle of a quan 
tified predicate to propositions and in particular 
to the doctrine of their conversion in which the 
complexity and incompleteness of the old doctrine 
will be contrasted with the simplicity and perfection 
of the new 

iii the influence of this principle on the doc 
trine of categorical syllogisms in contributing to 
effect specially the reduction of their general laws 
to one the abolition of their special laws and from 
this new simplicity the amplification of the valid 
forms of reasoning 

it may perhaps be well to state at the outset 
that in the following essay when not otherwise stated 
we proceed in the whole commonly recognised by 
logicians — the whole of extension understanding 



 new analytic of logical forms 

however that by changing the copula in propositions 
and accompanying this change by a transposition of 
the propositions in syllogisms what is said of the 
one whole of extension is equally applicable to the 
counter whole of comprehension 
we proceed then — 

i to state and apply the fundamental pos 
tulate of logic this postulate is — that we be 
allowed to state in language what is contained in 
thought 

the application of this postulate to the subject of a 
proposition is not denied logicians now universally 
allow that the subject has a determinate quantity in 
thought and this is accordingly expressed in lan 
guage with the subject of a proposition we have 
here therefore nothing to do it is to the predicate 
that we have to vindicate an interest in the postulate 
coequal with that of the subject 

in order to determine this we must inquire whether 
a notion holding the place of predicate in a proposi 
tion always has a determinate quantity in thought 

 in order to obviate mistake we may say that we use the word 
 determinate in relation to quantity generically as including 
under it definite universal or individual and indefinite particular 
in this sense it is simply opposed to that absence of all expressed 
quantity which logicians have generally represented by the term 
indefinite we do not know whether such usage be strictly correct 
but adopt it for the sake of convenience 



new analytic of logical forms 

if it have then the postulate has an immediate ap 
pkcation and this quantity must be expressed 

in answering this question we shall show — 

i that the predicate always has a determinate 
quantity in thought and ii explain the reason why 
this quantity is not generally expressed in common 
language 

we proceed to show then — 

i that a notion holding the place of predicate 
in a proposition always has a determinate quantity 
in thought 

that this is the case will appear from a little con 
sideration of what a notion is a notion or con 
cept is defined to be the cognition or idea of the 

 as this term has fallen out of use it may be necessary to say a 
word or two in explanation of its recall it is employed by sir w 
hamilton to discriminate in conception the product from the process 
the meaning of the term conception as commonly used is ambi 
guous since it is employed to denote both the act of conceiving and 
the product of that act the correlative term concept removes this 
ambiguity since it designates exclusively the product while the term 
conception is restricted to denote the act of conceiving it need 
scarcely be added that these terms are here employed according to 
their true etymological and scientific meaning to denote the acts and 
products of the comparative and not those of the representative 
faculty 

we said advisedly that this term had fallen out of use inasmuch 
as it was commonly employed by the older english writers on logic 
in its precise scientific significance to express those generalisations 
represented by common terms which are the ultimate elements of 
logical analysis and with which the first part of logic has mainly to 
do thus coke speaking of first and second notions says — those 
that primarily imposed names intended to name first the things 



f new analytic of logical forms 

general attribute or attributes in which a plurauty of 
objects coincide this obviously involves the per 
ception of a number of objects — their comparison — 
the recognition of their points of similarity — and their 
subjective union by this common attribute the 

themselves as the word nan is to express primarily the conceit which 
we form of human nature again now the second notions do 
not directly and by themselves shadow out unto us the things them 
selves nor anything accidental or appendant unto them but point 
out certain intellectual rules whereby we do with all distinctness 
and regularity form things that is the conceits of things art of 
logick p and again speaking of the various relations of words 
he says quite explicitly — the formal is the signification of the word 
and by consequence the relation to the conceit of the mind which it 
giveth knowledge of p j fraunce also uses the term con 
tinually thus to take a single example in defining an axiom he 
says it here signifieth any sentence or proposition whatsoever 
wherein one argument reason conceipt thing is so conjoined with 
or severed from another as that thereby we judge the one eyther to bee 
or not to bee the cause efiect whole part generall speciall subject 
adjunct divers disparate relative repugnant like unlike equall 
more or less to the other lawyers logick fol see another 
instance of this use from fraunce in the quotation given at p 
note the term is also used by granger in his divine logick 
and if i remember aright by wilson in his rule of reason it is 
to be found too employed in the same sense out of logical works and 
is used in this way by writers of authority we may sjecify as exam 
ples among others dr henry more and sir w raleigh all that 
now remains to us of this old use is the restricted sense in which the 
word conceit is employed — a sense at once so restricted and so esta 
blished as to unfit it for scientific use concept as strictly analo 
gical in form and precise in meaning is exactly the term we need to 
express the simplest products of the comparative faculty and as 
we have shown it already exists in the language what is necessary 
therefore in employing it is not an apology for its introduction but 
simply a vindication of its recall 



new analytic of logical forms 

possibility of this process determines the possibility 
of knowledge to man had he no power of classi 
fying in intellect the confused multitude of objects 
presented in sense he must remain for ever destitute 
of anything worthy of the name of knowledge with 
no clear recognition even of the individual since com 
parison and discrimination would be impossible he 
must for ever abide amidst the obscurity and vague 
ness in which knowledge commences — helpless amidst 
a multiplicity of objects which he could not compre 
hend — bewildered by a confusion which there was no 
possibility of recalling to order the earliest effort 
of the mind is accordingly directed to extricate itself 
from this confusion and this determines the exercise 
of the comparative faculty and the formation of con 
cepts or notions 

amidst the multitude of confused objects presented 
to the mind in perception some are found to affect 
us similarly in certain respects these objects the 
mind considers by comparison it recognises their 
resembling qualities by attention these are exclu 
sively considered since the concentration of the mind 
on those qualities in which objects coincide involves 
of necessity its abstraction from those in which 
they are severally dissimilar these various objects 
since the resembling attributes which they possess 
in common cannot when considered alone be discri 
minated are in this restricted point of view consi 
dered as one in other words the mind grasps into 



 new analytic of logical forms 

unity a multitude of objects severally distinct by a 
common point of identity on this unity thus formed 
it sets the seal of a name that it may be enabled ever 
afterwards at once to discriminate the various ob 
jects of its knowledge commodiously refer each to 
its own class and thus be saved the endless labour 
of enumerating all the particulars by which objects 
are individually discriminated a notion is thus a 
purely ideal or subjective whole which the mind 
from the limitation of its powers is necessitated to 
form in order to classify in thought and discriminate 
in language the various objects of its knowledge 

this being the case it is obvious that a concept or 
notion can afford only a partial knowledge and has 
only a relative existence it can afford only a par 
tial knowledge since it embraces some only of the 
many marks by which an object is known it has 
only a relative existence since this knowledge is not 
given absolutely but only in connexion with some 
one of the objects to which the concept is related 
for a notion though potentially applicable to all the 
objects which it contains can only be truly known 
on occasion of its being actually applied to some one 
of these objects this is at once the test and the 
evidence of its relative character and this being 
its character it is obviously altogether dependent on 
the objects from which it is formed a notion has 
thus in its totality a purely subjective existence 
destitute of an objective reality being what it is 



new analytic of logical forms 

— an ideal whole only by relation to the objects 
whose resembling part it embraces — it is obvious as 
we have said that it can pretend to no independent 
existence much less to any independent knowledge 
its existence entirely depends on that of the objects 
from whence it is derived and to each of which it is 
linked by the common resembling attribute which it 
embraces destroy the objects you destroy the re 
sembling attributes in each and destroying the re 
sembling parts you annihilate the whole which they 
together constituted as however a concept has 
only a subjective being existence and knowledge 
are here identical if no qualities be discriminated 
in objects as similar we have no knowledge of a 
concept — no concept exists if we cannot assign an 
object to any class — cannot say it does or does not 
belong to any notion we do not comprehend it we 
think an object recognise to be what it is only as 
we think it under some notion or concept 

this being premised with regard to notions in 
general it will be seen that when we bring an ob 
ject under a notion ie wdien we predicate of it that 
it belongs to such a class we must know that it oc 
cupies a certain place in that class for if we were 
uncertain what place the individual object occupied 
in the class or whether it occupied any place at all 
we should not know the class and could not there 
fore bring any object under it — eg if i do not 
know whether rose comes under the concept flovjer 




 new analytic of logical forms 

— whether it is equal to some part or the whole or 
superior to it — i do not know the class flower and 
cannot of course predicate flower of rose in other 
words i cannot bring rose under the concept flower 
since i do not know what the concept means what 
it contains and what it does not this is clear 
for as we have just explained — since a notion as a 
factitious unity in thought is absolutely worthless 
and indeed not cognisable out of relation to the in 
dividual objects the aggregate of whose resembling 
qualities it constitutes and since an object is truly 
known only as it is thought through or under a 
notion it follows that comprehension in such a case 
would be impossible if therefore we understand 
the object at all we must fix in thought the sphere 
which it occupies under the class to which in predi 
cation we have assigned it in other words — if we 
comprehend what we utter every notion holding the 
place of predicate in a proposition must have a deter 
minate quantity in thought 

this indeed is always involved in predication 
for predication is nothing more or less than the 
expression of the relation of quantity in which a 
notion stands to an individual or two notions to 
each other if this relation were indeterminate — 
if we were uncertain whether it was of part or 
whole or none — there could be no predication the 
very fact of predication is thus always evidence that 
the predicate notion holds a relation of determinate 



new analytic of logical forms 



 



quantity to the subject in other words we think 
only as we think under some determinate quantity 
for all thought is comparison of less and more of 
part and whole all predication is but the utterance 
of thought all predication must therefore have a 
determinate quantity 

since therefore the quantity always exists in 
thought the postulate applies that is in logic the 
quantity must be expressed on demand in language 

it only remains to remark here that this quantity 
of the predicate notion always determinate will be 
definite universal or individual or indefinite par 
ticular as the subject notion is greater equal to or 
less than the predicate if the subject notion be 
less we attribute to it a part only of the predicate — 
say it is some part but not the whole which that 
notion comprises eg all man is some mortal if 
the subject be equal to the predicate we attribute 
the whole notion to it eg all man is all rational 
if the subject be greater we attribute the whole pre 
dicate to it as a part only of its extension eg 
 some mortal is all man 

logicians who have occasionally touched upon the 
quantification of the predicate seem for the most 
part to have conceived the possibility of its express 
quantification only universally and because this 



 notandura signum universalitatis non esse apponendum prse 
dicato sed tantum subjecto recte enim dicitur omnis homo est 
animal sed non recto dicitur omnis homo est omne animav 



 new analytic of logical forms 

cannot be done in a great number of cases — in all 
those cases indeed in which an individual is brought 
under a concept or a species under a genus as 
we cannot say all man is all mortal — since this 
cannot be done to have lightly thereupon thrown 
aside the whole doctrine as of no avail it is how 
ever clear from the nature of a notion as a whole 
made up of the like characters in a number of ob 
jects avhich thus stand to it in the relation of parts 
that we are quite as much at liberty to say of one of 
these objects that it forms a part of the notion as 
we are to say of all the objects together that they 
constitute the whole we may therefore and in 

verum duse limitationes adhiberi possunt prima ut intelligatur 
de iiniversalibus affirmatis non autem de negatis recte enim dicitur 
 omnis homo est nullus asinus nullus asinus est omnis homo

on the catholic doctrine held by logicians touching the quantifi 
cation of the predicate see the appendix 

¦ the older logicians laid down many rules which were often 
useless sometimes false and at best of only partial and limited ap 
plication about what they termed the regular and irregular order 
of predication — the natural or unnatural direct or indirect consecu 
tion of the terms in a proposition natural or regular or direct 
predication predicatio tiaturalis directa ordinatd they held to be 
that in which the genus is predicated of the species the species of 
the individual the attribute of its subject and in general the exten 



new analytic of logical forms 



 



fact we must continually uantify the predicate par 
ticularly 



sive whole of its part and in which therefore the subject notion 
was always of less extent than the predicate notion unnatural in 
direct or irregular predication predicatio non naturalis indirecta 
inordinata was the reverse of this that to wit in which the species 
was predicated of the genus the subject of its attribute and in 
general the extensive part of its whole 

language is however but the instrument of thought and its 
natural order in the last resort must ever be that in which it best 
expresses the thought of which it is the vehicle what this order 
shall be will thus in great measure be determined by the feeling and 
purpose of the speaker if he have a special interest in any parti 
cular term or wishes in any way to make it emphatic it will occupy 
the more prominent and important place in the proposition the 
order in such a case will be that of interest and emphasis and this 
surely is as natural an arrangement as any other accordingly if i 
wish to direct particular attention to the genus it may stand first in 
the proposition and the species follow as its predicate thus for 
example if referring to the scaligers i were to say an acute phi 
losopher was the father an erudite philologer the son there would 
be nothing unnatural in this for by such an arrangement of the 
terms i simply direct special attention to the diflferent departments 
of science in which they respectively excelled so again in the line 
of the poet the proper study of mankind is man and in a num 
ber of other examples that will readily suggest themselves with equal 
justice if i wish to make the species or genus emphatic i may pre 
dicate the individual of it eg in the expressions a philosopher in 
deed was socrates the poet of all time is shakspeare there 
is nothing unnatural but attention is appropriately directed to the 
high type of poetic and philosophic character which respectively 
belonged to these great men 

it is no valid objection to this form of predication to say that in 
all such cases we do in reality so restrict the genus or species that 
they become convertible with the species or individual severally pre 
dicated of them for this objection lies equally against all predication 
whatever thus in what is termed the regular form the genus is never 



 new analytic of logical forms 

we proceed then — 

ii to explain why the quantity of the predicate 
is not expressed in common language 

we have already explained the nature of a con 
taken in the whole of its extent but only in so much of it as is oc 
cupied by the species of which it is predicated eg when we say 
 all man is animal we do not of course mean all animal but simply 
that part of animal which is convertible with man or as is sometimes 
more explicitly stated man is an one animal or if referring 
to the race a species of animal 

so again in relation to the second division of what is called un 
natural predication — that in which the subject is predicated of its 
attribute — if we wish specially to signalise the attribute that will 
naturally stand first eg in the exclamation great is diana of the 
ephesians the greatness of diana is far more emphatically marked 
than it would be if the terms were reversed so again in the line 
 the fairest of her daughters eve it is to the beauty of eve that 
special attention is directed 

it may be at once conceded to the logicians that what they have 
termed the natural or direct order is the more common inasmuch as 
the concrete terms of a proposition are generally of greater interest 
than the abstract ones but it is unjust to speak of any other order of 
predication as unnatural or unlawful while it is quite obvious that 
logically considered either order of consecution in the terms of a 
proposition is equally valid for we may indifferently predicate a part 
of the genus of the whole species or the whole species of a part of 
the genus this liberty indeed is not denied though it is generally 
nevertheless even by late writers allowed as an exception rather than 
as a rule thus gassendi after giving the rule that the species 
cannot be predicated of the genus says in mitigation of its force — 
 additur nihilominus nisi generi limitatio adhiheatur dicere enim 
possumus ut jam ante insinuatum est aliquod animal est homo 
certus quidam color est candor una qucepiam virtus est justitia 
efficitur nempe ut particulis hujusmodi limitantibus genus veluti 
contrahatur neque amplius pateat quam species ac proinde ut 
species de eo enunciari fierive illius attributum reciproce possit 
logica oxon p

cept — that it is a factitious whole obtained from a 
number of individual objects each of which there 
fore occupies a certain part of the whole concept 
we have also shown that this relation of quantity is 
always present to the mind when a concept and an 
individual or a part and whole of any kind are 
thought together as subject and predicate though 
always thus contained in thought this quantity is 
however rarely expressed in ordinary language 
the name in which the totality of attribute em 
braced by the concept is fixed is usually applied 
to any one of its individual objects without any 
particle of quantification the explanation of this 
omission is to be found in the end which com 
mon language seeks the end which it proposes 
to itself is the clear utterance of meaning it seeks 
to render at once intelligible by its signs the thing 
signified asa vehicle for the conveyance of thought 
ordinary language is mainly concerned about what is 
thought — not the manner of thinking it in other 
and more technical terms it is primarily engaged 
with the matter of thought and only considers the 
form incidentally and as a mean to an end what 
ever therefore is not really necessary to the clear 
comprehension of what is contained in thought is 
usually ehded in expression thus common lan 
guage abounds with abbreviations and elliptical 
forms of expression the expression of those phases 
of thought and feeling which arise in conjunctions of 



 new analytic of logical foiims 

circumstances which are frequent and familiar are 
almost always and conveniently of this description 
eg — we meet a friend and say good morning j 
what is intended here a cordial greeting and 
the expression of friendly feeling this however is 
not expressed in terms but the elhptical form above 
is understood to represent i wish you a good 
morning so also in farewell and a multitude 
of other cases which might be adduced in fact so 
that what is meant by it be at once clearly intelhgible 
an expression however elliptical is true and valid for 
all the purposes of ordinary language thus to 
facilitate the communication of thought not only are 
words omitted but the steps of the reasoning pro 
cess itself are for the most part abbreviated com 
mon language almost invariably makes an ellipsis of 
one step of this process for since the reasoning 
process is the same in all men — being governed by 
laws necessary and universal — the mind at once and 
intuitively supplies the omitted step and the process 
is complete this principle too affords the true 
explanation why in common language the overt 
quantification of the predicate is neglected it is 
not necessary for the clear comprehension of a pro 
position that the predicate be quantified in terms 
and the reason why this is not necessary is to 
be found in the universality of generalisation or the 
formation of concepts and the sameness of the pro 
cess in all men all men must generalise for the 



new analytic of logical forms 

necessity which determines this process exists in all 
all men must generahse alike for the faculties which 
accomplish it are the same in all in order to com 
prehend the many objects by which he is surrounded 
he must reduce them to order to accomplish this 
he classifies or groups into unity a number of objects 
which affect him in the same manner but as the 
same objects affect all men in the same manner it 
follows that where the same term exists to express 
the same mental modification this term may and 
will be apphed to all the individual objects which 
determine such similar impressions 

as all men therefore know what is meant by a 
general term — that it is a name equally applicable to 
all and each of the individual objects which it em 
braces when one of these objects is brought under 
it that is to say when it is predicated of this object 
that it forms a part of the notion which the general 
term expresses it is not absolutely necessary overtly 
to declare that it forms only some part for as it is 
universally known that the concept is of far wider 
extension the quantity is immediately supplied in 
thought and no mistake arises thus when we say 
 every horse is an animal — all men are mortal 
it is not necessary to say that there are other ani 
mals besides horses or to guard explicitly against 
the conclusion that man alone is mortal for as the 
extension of the general terms is understood by all 
every one knows at once by a reference to the matter 

b

of the thought that in each case the predicate is 
affirmed of its subject only in some part of its exten 
sion not in the whole 

since therefore it is not necessary for the clear 
understanding of a proposition that the predicate 
notion be expressly quantified and as the continual 
repetition of it would be wearisome the quantifica 
tion is usually omitted in other words since it is 
not necessary for the purposes which ordinary lan 
guage seehs to accomplish the quantity of the predi 
cate though always contained in thought is usually 
elided in expression 

all this however becomes widely different when 
in the progress of reflective inquiry a science arises 
which seeks as its express aim to accomplish a full 
and final analysis of the form of thought it will be 
the office of such a science to supply for its own 
purposes the omissions of common language — to re 
store whatever of the form of thought may have 
fallen out of expression in ordinary parlance the 
procedure of logic and that of common language are 
thus different and to some extent opposed the 
former recalling to expression as of scientific value 
what the latter had thrown aside as of no account 
the different nature of their procedure is as we have 
hinted determined by the different nature of the 
ends which they respectively seek to accomplish 
common language as we have seen seeks as its elid 
to exhibit with clearness the matter of thought what 



new analytic of logical forms 



 



ever does not contribute to this is thrown aside as 
worthless logic on the other hand seeks as its 
end to exhibit imth exactness the form of thought 
whatever contributes to this is retained as of scien 
tific value all the elements vhich the analysis of 
the form of thought furnishes must be brought out 
to view and explicitly considered whatever does 
not belong to the form of thought must be cast aside 
as without the province of the science we have 
seen that in thought the predicate notion of a pro 
position is always of a given quantity this quan 
tity is not expressed in common language because 
by a knowledge of and reference to the matter of 
thought the omission is at once supplied this pro 
cedure is however of course incompetent to logic 
as a formal science it knows nothing of the matter 
of thought it makes no elisions it can understand 
nothing it can supply nothing it can only recog 
nise and deal scientifically with what is given for 
mally if therefore the predicate has always a cer 
tain quantity in thought and we have shown it has 
that quantity must be expressed before it can be 
logically taken into account and its significance in 
vestigated the recognition of the expressed quan 
tity of the predicate is then as imperative in logic as 
the neglect of such recognition is convenient in com 
mon language for it is plain that unless all the 
elements furnished by analysis be received and con 
sidered in their relative influence and importance the 



 new analytic of logical forms 

science cannot pretend to completeness logic in 
common with all sciences seeks perfection but as 
a formal science it can only realise scientific perfec 
tion as it attains to formal exactness the condition 
of its formal exactness is that its analysis of the 
form of thought be exhaustive and complete as 
soon as this is the case synthesis may commence 
and the science will emerge in its full beauty and 
true perfection 

this explains how it is that logic has remained so 
imperfect and deformed in the hands of all previous 
logicians they were in the main right as far as 
they went but they did not go far enough their 
investigation of the form of thought was arrested 
before it had attained the necessary completeness 
proceeding in their analysis they correctly recalled 
to expression what common language had omitted in 
the reasoning process and exhibited the three steps 
of that process in their formal order and complete 
ness still continuing their analysis they proceeded 
to investigate the properties of a proposition in order 
to determine its scientific capabilities here they 
discovered that the subject has always a certain 
quantity in thought this quantity in conformity 
with the necessities of their science they accordingly 
expressed and turned to scientific account but 
here their analysis was stopped just at the very 
point the investigation of which would have conferred 
upon their science the completeness which it lacked 



new analytic of logical forms 

and as the natural result of a defective analysis 
logic as a science has always remained incomplete 
had logicians proceeded further they would have 
discovered that a determinate quantity always be 
longs not only to the subject of a proposition but 
also to the predicate that the recognition of this 
quantity in logic affords an important principle the 
true appkcation of which would relieve it of its many 
inconsistencies and confer upon it scientific perfec 
tion it will be our business presently to inquire 
into some of the improvements thus effected 

to recapitulate then — we have seen from the 
nature of a notion in general and of a predicate no 
tion in particular that it always has a determinate 
quantity in thought we have thus vindicated to it an 
interest in the fundamental postulate of logic and 
from the application of that postulate there has 
emerged the principle — that the quantity of the pre 
dicate notion of a proposition he explicitly noted in 
logic 

we proceed now to show — 

ii — the application of this principle to propo 
sitions and in particular to the doctrine of their 
conversion 

a proposition is defined to be the expression in 
language of the relation of congruence or confliction 
in which two notions two individuals or an individual 



 new analytic of logical forms 

and a notion in a word two terms are recognised 
when compared together to stand to each other 

this being the nature of a proposition it is evident 
that it involves a plurality of ideasf thought toge 
ther in mutual relation and dependence since it is 
only by being viewed in relation as subject and pre 
dicate determining and determined that a plurality 
of thoughts can be reduced to a mental oneness and 
recognised together in the same individual act of 
consciousness 

the terms of a proposition are thus always related 
and this relation constitutes their scientific signifi 
cance to investigate this relation fully and de 
termine it exactly is the office of logical analysis 
as a proposition is the expression of the relation of 
congruence or confliction between two thoughts it 
is surely of the highest importance — in fact a con 
dition of its intelligible existence — that the amount 
of this agreement or difference be known and stated 
this can only be done by ascertaining the quantity 
of both the terms and thus determining the space of 
each in relation to the other until this be done 
the properties of a proposition have not been fully 
analysed its scientific capabilities cannot be fully 
determined the quantity of the terms in relation

to each other is thus the most important aspect in 
which a proposition can be considered but though 
thus the most important relation it is one in the ana 
lysis of which logicians in general seem to have been 
more than commonly unsuccessful in opposition to 
the obvious importance and necessity of determining 
the quantity of the terms in a proposition they have 
introduced into logic a class of propositions distin 
guished by the absence of all quantity and this too 

 the class of propositions distinguished by the absence of all ex 
pressed quantity and termed by logicians indefinite more properly 
indesigyiate affords another curious illustration of how completely 
the force of authority has in logic prevailed over the most obvious 
and elementary necessities of the science introduced originally by 
aristotle and subsequently reproduced by boethius these proposi 
tions have continued to occupy a place in the science and to be dis 
criminated as a separate class under the division of quantity in 
the absence of all expressed quantity however it was very difficult 
to turn them to any logical account some kind of quantity was 
necessary for this purpose but the only way in which they could 
be quantified with any certainty was particularly according to the 
caution of apuleius who says referring to the division of proposi 
tions under the head of quantity aliae indefinitaa ut animal spirat 
non enim definit utrum omne an aliquod sed tamen pro particu 
lari semper valet quia tutius est id ex incerto accipere quod 
minus est de stuogismo categorico apideii opera lugd 
 p 

subsequently however as stated in the text rules for determin 
ing this quantity were laid down derived from the objectmatter of 
the propositions themselves by ramus indeed and some of his 
followers indefinites it would seem were altogether rejected as of no 
logical account his english representative fraunce i have not 
ramus own works at hand says referring to the indefinite propo 
sition but ramus expelleth that uncertaine and indefinite axiom

must know what it means — ie understand the quan

they continued nevertheless to be currently received and a later 
english writer but reflects this common acceptance when he makes 
them the matter of special legislation the canons hereof says 
coke speaking of this class are two he then gives the follow 
ing which are however but translations and abridgments from 
keckermann — 

 the chief force and use of indefinites is in propositions of the 
idea that is in such as where the universal subject is taken abso 
lutely as — the lords supper is a sacrament man is the noblest 
creature the soul of man is immortal c 

 there is also a use of indefinites to signifie that the conse 
quent is in the antecedent for the most part though not always 
cog it ti kotj as the cretians be lyars mothers are too much 
cockerers of their children c art of logick p 

a recent british writer however sees far more clearly into their 
true logical character and relation and says of them referring to 
the rules which are given for their reduction with far more scien 
tific than historic truth by reduction here is to be understood that 
logicians recognise no indefinite propositions and that if an inde 
finite occur they require it to be expressed in a definite form in 
definite propositions are noticed that the logician should be on his 
guard against them and not because they are legitimate or of any 
legitimate class thymus compendium of logic dublin 
p 

this is far from being historically true and if it were it would not 
avail to defend the position which indefinites occupy for the prin 
ciple of their reduction is as extralogical as are the propositions to 
be reduced in the statement that they are not recognised in logic 
as a separate class this author has at once overrated the acuteness 
of his predecessors and underrated his own for it is only within a 
comparatively short period that their logical position has been seri 



new analytic of logical forms 

allowed to express all that is understood as an 
antidote to the disorders thus introduced into their 
science they have had recourse to an extralogical 
remedy that is to say they have laid down a num 
ber of rules for determining the quantity of these 
unquantified propositions founded on the object 
matter of these propositions themselves according as 
this matter is possible or impossible necessary or 
contingent in so doing they have implicitly at 
least destroyed their science for if logic be com 
petent to this discrimination it can no longer vindi 
cate to itself the character of a special science but 
must become coextensive with the whole domain of 
human knowledge they have thus also destroyed 
the possibility of its thoroughgoing apphcation since 
they have tacitly laid down as a preliminary to such 
application the impossible condition that we should 

ously called in question they are however as need scarcely now 
be stated to be rejected from logic as utterly unscientific in their 
character they belong indeed to the same confusion of the acci 
dental with the essential through which the enthymeme was dis 
criminated as a separate form of reasoning in both the mere coi 
tingencies of speech are identified with the necessities of thought 
and the accidents of expression are received and incorporated with 
the science as valid elements of form science however is no longer 
worthy of the name when it accepts and incorporates without ex 
amination the rude materials which it is its office to elaborate and 
places among its elements the confused wholes which a more search 
ing analysis would have decomposed into their constituent parts 
this is precisely what has happened in relation to the indefinite 
proposition and the enthymeme and accordingly by a truer scien 
tific analysis they arc finally rejected from logic 



 new analytic of logical forms 

know all that is possible and all that is impossible 
all that is contingent and all that is necessary to 
say nothing of its logical inconsistency — this being 
impossible is as a scientific demand absurd 

logicians have not however of course left propo 
sitions generally in this unquantified state or their 
science would have remained hopelessly crippled 
they proceeded as we have already said to consider 
the quantity of propositions but here their incon 
sistency still attends them and they are destined to 
be again unsuccessful for in their analysis as we 
have seen they have only considered the subject 
and determined its quantity while that of the predi 
cate which it was equally necessary to determine as 
being of equal scientific value is altogether neglected 
the proximate influence of this omission in intro 
ducing complexity and inconsistency into the science 
will be seen in the common doctrine of conversion 
while some of its remoter consequences will be here 
after signalised it may be well to premise here 
that we speak of categorical propositions throughout 
we go on then to notice the conversion of proposi 
tions on the common doctrine when the subject and 
predicate of a proposition change places the proposi 
tion is said to he converted 

this conversion is threefold 

 simple conversion — this takes place when the 
terms are simply transposed without any change of 
quantity or quality in the proposition this is com 



new analytic of logical forms 

petent in universal negative and particular affirma 
tive propositions eg — 

no man is a stone therefore 

no stone is a man 

some man is a tinker therefore 

some tinker is a man 

 conversion per accidens — this takes place when 
the quality of the two propositions remains the same 
but the quantity is altered the predicate in the one 
being limited on becoming the subject of the other 
this holds true in universal propositions both affir 
mative and negative eg — 

all violets are flowers ¦ therefore 
some flowers are violets 

 this is the statement of peter hispanus and it has been re 
peated by derodon and some others among the later logicians the 
application of this species of conversion to universal negatives is 
however altogether useless as they are converted simply and thus 
retain their universality after conversion it is moreover incompe 
tent inasmuch as in such a process an inference of subordination 
is involved 

by the majority of logical writers it is therefore applied exclu 
sively and formally to universal affirmative propositions as so ap 
plied however the name which it bears is unsuitable since it no 
longer truly designates the nature of the process which it is em 
ployed to express taken in this exclusive application restrictive or 
attenvme conversion the name given to it by granger would be 
much better 

it is worth while noticing that the logicians in general do not 
seem to be at all aware by whom this term per accid£ns as applied 
to conversion was introduced or what was the kind of process which 
it was originally employed to denote none refer to its authorship 
while few attempt any explanation of its meaning and the few who 
do are for the most part incorrect isenach whose epitome dia

when the quahty of the propositions remains un 
affected but the terms are changed into what is 
called by logicians infinite but more appropriately 

lecticce was published about the year says in explanation 
that this species of conversion was called er accidens because one 
of the accidents of the proposition quantity to wit was changed 
keckermann gives a somewhat difierent and longer account of it he 
says that this kind of conversion is called per accidens because the 
converted is not immediately inferred from the converse but only 
mediately through the intervention of another proposition eg from 
the proposition all man is animal it is not immdiatdy inferred 
that some animal is man but rather that some man is animal 
and as this can be converted simply it follows that some animal is 
man sy sterna logicce francof p while a recent 
oxford writer gives the following not very intelligible explanation — 
 per accidens — putting in the place of the subject the quality 
whether proprium or accident which the predicate implies by the 
old logicians the proprium is constantly called accidens proprium 
moherlfs lectures on logic oxford p it is difficult 
to see how this statement even supposing it to be just as far as it 
goes can be accepted as a full account of the matter — inasmuch as 
it can at best only apply to those cases in which the predicate is the 
property or accident of the subject and by no means to the generic 
latitude of possible predication to which the conversion extends

knowledge extends who seems to have understood the sense in which 
it was originally employed and who has accordingly given the true

indefinite by the addition of negative particles that 
is to say when in the converted proposition instead 
of the subject and predicate simply the contradictory 
of each is found eg —

and thing this term was employed by him to denote the conver 
sion of the universal into the particular and the particular into the 
universal from the accident of the matter of the proposition he 
says harum propositionum igitur particularis affirmatio particu

but the formal conversion to be carefully distinguished from the 
material conversion of boethius which the term was subsequently 
and exclusively employed to denote had been discriminated long before 
the time of boethius it was expressly taken by aristotle and called 
by him partial or particular conversion dvtifftopr sv fmssi anal

potest ita converti ut sit omne animal homo sed particulariter

it may seem useless to have dwelt so long on this kind of conver 
sion in the very act of abolishing it but that it is dead is no reason 
whatever why so venerable a member of the ancient system should 
not receive decent burial 

 for the reference to boethius i am indebted to sir w hamilton 



 new analytic of logical forms 

this holds true in universal affirmative and par 
ticular negative propositions the rules governing 
conversion are given by different logicians with nu 
merical differences in substance however they are 
much the same but as the enumeration would be 
tedious and the nature of the process in its different 
species is evident from the statement of each we 
shall not repeat them here 

we might remark on this process generally that 
it is for the most part logically incompetent since 
in the second species we interpolate a quantity not 
formally given and in the third create an entirely 
new proposition by new terms 

but we pass on to remark specially that the whole 
doctrine of conversion as commonly understood is 
on the principle of the new analytic false and use 
less 

this inconsistent and cumbrous doctrine resulted 
as we have said from a false analysis by logicians of 
the elements with which they had to deal the whole 
doctrine is founded upon the relation of quantity be 
tween the subject and predicate in a proposition but 
if a principal element of that relation be left out the 
doctrine will of course be defective logicians stand 
chargeable with this neglect they commenced to 
recompose their system before hy thorough decom 
position they had obtained all the elements requisite 

 crackanthorpe gives five wallis six another british writer

new analytic of logical forms 

for that purpose and to remedy the deficiencies 
thus occasioned they have had recourse to the com 
phcated process briefly stated above — thus with 
labour and difficulty — and even then imperfectly — by 
a complex process and a number of particular rules 
effecting that which a simple proximate principle of 
their science would if recognised have spontaneously 
and perfectly accomplished as this confusion and 
complexity has arisen from a faulty analysis so a 
perfect analysis at once introduces order and simpli 
city a full decomposition of the elements contained 
in thought discovers that the predicate is always of 
a given quantity in relation to the subject that this 
is known and recognised as the condition of predica 
tion it thus reveals that the relation between the 
terms of a proposition is one not only of similarity 
but oiidentity that the subject and predicate of a 
proposition when the relation of each to the other is 
recognised and both are quantified are always neces 
sarily simply convertible that the terms of a propo 
sition in short are of an absolute equality and all 
predication an equation of subject and predicate 
quantify the predicate and two notions of different 
extension are at once brought into equality the 
sphere of an individual object in a notion is marked 
out and that sphere becomes absolutely convertible 
with the object eg — 

all man is some animal 
some animal is all man 



 new analytic of logical foems 

some men are all philosophers 
ah philosophers are some men 

boethius is some roman 
some roman is boethius 

thus on the principle of the new analytic the 
whole doctrine of ordinary conversion with its com 
plex species and its manifold rules passes away 
and the whole process becomes as practically simple 
as it is scientifically complete the terms of a pro 
position are exhibited in their true relation and 
that relation reduces all the species of conversion 
to one — that of simple conversion thus in the 
words of an acute writer whose apt statement in 
relation to this doctrine is true in a far wider ap 
plication than he designed it — to the whole and 
not to a part alone of the doctrine of conversion 
 omnes conversionum leges pendent a cohaesione 
vel potius ab identitate subjecti et attributi quod si 
enim subjectum conjungitur et identificatur ut aiunt 
cum attribute necesse est pariter attributum uniri et 
identificari cum subjecto

abolition of their special laws and from this new 
simplicity the amplification of the valid forms of rea 
soning 

we premise a word or two on the nature of a 
syllogism in general and of a categorical syllogism 
in particular 

 a syllogism is the product of that act of mediate 
comparison by which we recognise that two notions 
stand to each other in the relation of whole and 
part through the recognition that these notions 
severally stand in the same relation to a third 

a syllogism or reasoning is thus like a concept and 
a judgment the product of the comparative faculty — 
the comparison of part and whole this indeed is 
the characteristic of all reasoning — alike of the simple 
syllogism and of the most lengthy and profound argu 
ment all reasoning is but the comparison and deter 
mination of wholes and parts as in concepts various 
attributes in judgments various thoughts are com 
pared in order to determine the relation of part and 
whole subsisting between them so in reasoning two 
notions are compared together with a third in order 
to determine their connexion with each other — the 
only difference being the higher complexity which 
in this case the act of comparison assumes a rea 
soning thus differs from a judgment in the superior 
complexity of the act in being an immediate act of 
comparison in which two notions whose relation 

c 



 new analytic of logical fokms 

to each other is unknown are compared together 
through a third whose connexion with both is recog 
nised but it agrees with a judgment in being an 
undivided act of mind for as the connexion of part 
and whole between two notions enounced by a reason 
ing is determined by the recognition of their mutual 
relation to a third and as relatives are only recog 
nised together it follows that it is an undivided act of 
consciousness a syllogism indeed forms as truly a 
mental whole as a concept though each is capable of 
being subsequently analysed for scientific purposes 
into its constituent elements on being subjected 
to such analysis every true syllogism or reasoning is 
found to contain three and no more than three pro 
positions each of which has three and only three 
terms there will be three propositions since the 
two notions touching whose relation the mind is in 
doubt are both compared with another whose rela 
tion to each is manifest this affords two proposi 
tions in one of which the third notion is a contained 
part in relation to one of the doubtful notions and 
in the other a containing whole in relation to the 
other doubtful notion and there is of necessity the 
conclusion in which the doubt is dispelled and the 
relation of the two notions themselves determined 
this process is in every valid syllogism determined 
by a law of thought and the connexion is thus one

et intuitive uno actu mentis perspicitur — ploucquet 



new analytic of logical forms 

of absolute necessity there will it is obvious be as 
many valid kinds of syllogism as there are different 
laws of thought on which they may be respectively 
founded 

a categorical syllogism is one in whose major pre 
mise the relation of the terms is simple whose pro 
cedure is determined and whose conclusion is neces 
sitated by the laws of identity and contradiction 

having premised thus much about syllogisms in 
general and categorical syllogisms in particular we 
shall proceed — 

i to state with brevity the common doctrine of 
syllogistic figure mood and reduction and then 
generally some of the defects by which it is charac 
terised 

and 

ii to state the one supreme canon of the new 
analytic which potentially contains the whole doctrine 
of categorical syllogisms and then proceed to develop 
from it some parts of that doctrine 

we proceed then — 

i to state the common doctrine of syllogistic 
figure mood and reduction 

figure — what is commonly termed by logicians 
syllogistic figure arises from the relation of the middle 
term as subject or predicate to the extremes the 
four possible varieties of position which the middle 



 new analytic of logical forms 

term may occupy in the premises thus determine 
four syllogistic figures 
 in iyiq first figure the middle term is the subject of 
the major premise and the predicate of the minor 
eg— 

all rational is risible 
all man is rational 
therefore — all man is risible 

the laws of this figure are — 

 that the subsumption be affirmative 

 these words sumption and subsumption are new and may there 
fore require a few words of explanation if not of defence they are 
introduced and employed by sir william hamilton to express the 
two first propositions of a syllogism instead of the common designa 
tions major and minor premise 

we much need apt terms by which to express these members of 
the syllogism and for the creation of new or introduction of foreign 
words in such a relation may certainly urge the first part of the plea 
of lucretius propter egestatem linguae if we cannot go on to add 
with him et rerum novitatem the members to be named are 
old enough but they still have never received precise and discrimi 
native epithets at least in our logical terminology the terms major 
and minor premise are objectionable if for no other reason from the 
confusion of terms with propositions likely enough to arise from the 
omission of the second member of the term and the consequent in 
discriminate use in hasty reference of the epithets major and minor 
alone single precise and discriminative words would on every 
account be far better than these combinations the term propositio 
was the designation of the major premise of a syllogism from the 
days of cicero downwards with few exceptions among these excep 
tions are quintilian who uses intentio boethius who sometimes uses 
sumptum and rodolphus agricola who employs expositio assump 
tio was even more generally the designation of the second proposition 
of the syllogism — the minor premise so that in fact when the two 
first members of a syllogism are not after aristotle called the major 



new analytic of logical forms 

 that the sumption be universal 
in the second figure the middle term is the pre 
dicate in each premise eg — 

no liar is to be believed 
every good man is to be believed 
therefore — no good man is a liar 

and minor proposition the terms proposition and assumption are 
generally found employed to express them these terms all more 
or less shadow forth the relation of subordination which exists be 
tween these parts of the syllogism this relation is however far 
more aptly and explicitly denoted by the correlative terms sumption 
and suhsumption and as we have already assume and assumption 
with other cognate terms there is no reason why we should not also 
avail ourselves of the convenient terms subsumption and subsume 

even the terms sumption and subsumption are not however equal 
to the whole extent of the necessity for between the two first mem 
bers of syllogisms in the second and third figures there is no such 
relation of subordination as they express so that it is only by courtesy 
to custom that these terms can be applied to them the same is 
true of the reasoning from wholes to wholes so that we still need 
terms of generic latitude sufficient to express the two first members 
of any syllogism for all ordinary purposes however the above are 
sufficient they have the great merit of being single and precise 
epithets and after what has been said their use in the figures can 
not be misunderstood 

the only thoroughgoing and consistent attempt ever made that 
 am aware of to render the technicalities of logical science into 
english terms was that of ralph lever dean of durham in his 
logical treatise entitled the art of reason rightly termed wit 
craft teaching a perfect way to argue and dispute and published in 
london in the year he expressly undertakes to accomplish this 
he explains and defends his procedure in the preface forespeach 
of which the following extract may be taken as a specimen — for 
trial hereof i wish you to aske any english man who understandeth 
neither greek nor latin what he conceiveth in his mind when he 
heareth this word a backset and what he doth conceive when he 
heareth this term a predicate and doubtlesse he must confesse if

the laws of this figure are — 

 that one of the two premises be negative and 
consequently that the conclusion be so 

 that the sumption be universal 

in the third figure the middle term is the subject 
in both premises eg — 

all man is risible 
all man is capable of science 
therefore — some capable of science is risible 

the laws of this figure are — 

 that the subsumption be affirmative 

 that the conclusion be particular 

in he fourth figure the middle term is the predi 
cate in the sumption and the subject in the subsump 
tion eg — 

all oranges are fruit 
all fruit is refreshing 
therefore — some refreshing things are oranges 

he consider the matter aright or have any sharpnesse of wit at al 
that by a backset he conceiveth a thing that must be set after and by 
 predicate that he doth understand nothing at all he accordingly 
renders every or certainly almost every technical term of common 
use in logic by combinations of purely saxon words we will give 
both as a specimen of his coinage and as pertinent to the purpose of 
the present note the terms which he has used to express the differ 
ent members of the syllogism these are foresay and endsay first 
foresay major premise second foresay minor premise endsay 
conclusion or in his own words — the two first shewsayes propo 
sitions that are placed in a reason by rule are called foresayes — the 
third may be termed an endsay art of witcraft p these 
terms are sufficiently general for any form of syllogism but as the 
technical terms of the science are all of latin derivation saxon com 
pounds cannot be accepted 



new analytic of logical forms 

the laws of this figure are — 

 when the sumption is affirmative the sub 
sumption is always universal 

 when the subsumption is affirmative the con 
clusion is particular 

 if either of the premises be negative the sump 
tion must be universal 

mood — what is called mood is a modification of 
a syllogism determined by the quantity and quality 
of the propositions of which it is composed all the 
figures admit of syllogistic variations thus deter 
mined four kinds of propositions are according 
to logicians afforded by the various possible combi 
nations of quantity and quality universal affirma 
tive a — universal negative e — particular affir 
mative i — particular negative and as there 
are three propositions in every syllogism all the 
possible combinations of quality and quantity will be 
sixtyfour of these sixteen are excluded from hav 
ing negative premises twelve from having parti 
cular premises twelve more for having a negative 
premise with an affirmative conclusion eight from 
one of the premises being particular but the con 
clusion universal and finally four more from hav 
ing a negative conclusion where both premises were 
affirmative there are thus left twelve moods of 
these however for various particular reasons six 

 these laws are taken from the fortroyal logic but they are 
substantially the same in most logical systems

only are allowable in each figure making twenty 
four in all of these however five are again thrown 
out of account from having a particular conclusion 
where a universal is competent there thus re 
main in all the figures only nineteen valid moods 
these are embodied in the wellknown lines — bar 
bara celarent c 

reduction — logicians though altogether ignor 
ant of the true character of figure strictly so called 
seem always however to have felt that the form of 
reasoning in the first figure was more exact than in 
the three others and the conclusion afforded by it 
more logically direct and satisfactory they have 
accordingly devised a process for changing syllo 
gisms of the three other figures into those of the 
first this process is technically termed reduction 
reduction is twofold — 

 reductio ostensiva — this is effected by the 
conversion and transposition of propositions eg — 
disamis of the third figure into darii of the first 

disamis 
some tyrant is unjust 
all tyrants are cruel 
some cruel is unjust 

here the major premise and conclusion are first 
converted and then the premises transposed thus — 

darii 
all tyrants are cruel 
some unjust are tyrants 
some unjust are cruel 



new analytic of logical fokms 

 redudio ad impossibile — this is effected not 
directly but indirectly by proving that the contra 
dictory of the syllogism under examination is some 
thing impossible or absurd this is accomplished 
by taking the contradictory of the conclusion with 
one of the premises and inferring from these the 
contradictory of the other premise — in the second 
figure the contradictory of the minor — in the third 
the contradictory of the major premise thus — 
barogo of the second into barbara of the first figure 

baroco 
all rational is risible 
some animals are not risible 
some animals are not rational 

barbara 
all rational is risible 
all animal is rational 
all animal is risible 

such on the common doctrine is a short account 
of syllogistic figure mood and reduction we go 
on to state generally some of the defects by which 
this doctrine is characterised 

 the whole doctrine is cumbrous and unsatis 
factory 

in addition to the general laws which are laid 
down by logicians as governing all syllogisms and 
the various kinds of syllogism which have been sig 
nalised we have here what are represented as four 
new essential variations of the syllogistic form each 



 new analytic of logical forms 

guarded by its own complement of special laws — 
forming altogether a code of particular rules for the 
detection of petty offences which is certainly suffi 
ciently intricate and perplexing now the necessity 
of these empirical laws is not attempted to be vindi 
cated on any thoroughgoing logical principle and 
until it be we think their minute and multiform cha 
racter is valid ground of objection no right more 
over has been established that we know of for the 
three last figures themselves to occupy the place 
they do as true variations of the syllogistic form ex 
cept a prescriptive right which in logic where so 
many false principles have for so long usurped author 
ity and so many true ones been ignored when un 
accompanied by any other is rather ground for sus 
picion than otherwise accordingly till a better 
right than this be shown why they should be con 
sidered independent syllogistic forms their want of 
conformity to recognised law in their procedure and 
the indirectness of their conclusions furnish good 
ground of dissatisfaction with their logical position 

next we have the moods in each figure — the test 
ing of the true moods in each by its particular laws 
— these laws determining the exclusion in one figure 
of moods that are held valid in another and this 
exclusion thus necessarily producing a numerical dif 
ference of moods in different figures that what is a 
true mood in one figure should be a false one in 
another is to say the least unsatisfactory 



new analytic of logical forms 

and finally we have the doctrine of eeduction — 
the most cumbrous and unsatisfactory part of the 
whole the first half of the process involves a pro 
cedure opposed to other parts of the common doc 
trine since it admits the transposition of premises 
at will of this however more presently the 
procedure of the second half of the process is almost 
ingeniously perplexed and cumbrous and when 
accomplished so far as we see answers no end what 
ever we form an entirely new syllogism which 
throws no light upon the old illustrates no part 
that was before obscure gives us indeed no know 
ledge at all the old figure remains with its irregu 
larity if it had any uncorrected with its illegal 
aspect if that were its vice unremoved it is in 
short cumbrous without the justification of being 
useful and most unsatisfactory it should seem in 
the mere wantonness of being so since it cannot 
urge the extenuating plea of necessity 

 this doctrine is inconsistent 

we begin by noticing the inconsistency displayed 
in the discrimination of moods on the common doc 
trine we have seen that the principle on which 
the discrimination of moods proceeds is the differ 
ence in quantity and quality of the propositions 
which constitute a syllogism in order to deter 
mine a variation of mood in a syllogism one at least 
of its propositions must differ in one or other of these 
respects from all other coordinate moods if in 



 new analytic of logical forms 

two syllogisms of a given figure there be no differ 
ence either of quantity or quality in the proposi 
tions of which they are composed these syllogisms 
are logically reckoned as one and the same there 
is in this case no modal variation this at least is 
the common doctrine if that doctrine have any 
meaning in opposition thereto however we have 
discriminated as true varieties ii the second figure — 

camestres 

all wise men are truly happy 

no intemperate man is truly happy 

no intemperate man is a wise man 

cesare 

no intemperate man is truly happy 

all wise men are truly happy 

no wise man is an intemperate man 

and in the third figure — 

datisi 
every true patriot is brave 
some true patriots are persecuted 
some that are persecuted are brave 

disanis 
some true patriots are persecuted 
every true patriot is brave 
some who are brave are persecuted 

now the syllogisms thus given under each figure 
have no difference whatever in the quantity or qua 



new analytic of logical foems 

lity of their propositions they are therefore accord 
ing to the theory of logicians the same practically 
however they have been considered from time im 
memorial as distinct as constituting valid variations 
of syllogistic form under each figure if this be so 
the principle on which the discrimination of mood 
avowedly proceeds is at least implicitly given up 
and another is introduced — that of the transposition of 
propositions for it is on this principle alone that the 
syllogisms given above can be vindicated as distinct 
if however the transposed order of propositions be 
recognised as affording a worthy principle for the dis 
crimination of syllogistic difference then a number 
of new forms will emerge of which logicians have 
taken no account the catalogue of syllogistic va 
riations will immediately be swelled far beyond its 
present limits since every existing variety is capable 
by the transposition of its propositions of receiving 
a fivefold amplification it is clear however that 
the transposed order of propositions affords no prin 
ciple of any scientific value in the discrimination of 
syllogisms and what is more to the present pur 
pose it is equally clear that whatever be its value it 
is one which has not been recognised by logicians 
since they have not even incidentally adverted to it 
in the exposition of their doctrine the principle 
of aiodal variation on that doctrine is manifestly 
the difference of propositions in quantity and qua 
lity in obvious inconsistency however with this 



 new analytic of logical forms 

recognised law there remain the syllogisms stated 
above 

but a more important if not more glaring inconsis 
tency remains to be noticed in the correlative doctrines 
of figures and reduction the opposition here is so 
great that it seems to us truly marvellous that they 
should ever have existed together they appear mu 
tually and triumphantly to destroy each other we 
will endeavour to explain what we mean in a few words 
the inconsistency may he stated thus in the cogency 
of formal proof there can be no degrees logic it 
need hardly be repeated is a formal science proceed 
ing from and determined through its whole course by 
the laws of thought this being the case every true 
variation of the syllogistic form will afford a conclu 
sion equally valid and direct since a form of rea 
soning is true only as determined by a law of thought 
and the laws of thought are equally universal and 
imperative if a given syllogistic form be deter 
mined as original and essential it is already self 
sufficient it needs no help it can receive none 
no process can be devised for bestowing on its con 
clusion a higher validity than that which it possesses 
of its own inherent right for as we have said of 
formal proof there can be no degrees of cogency 
in every case it is alike valid and direct with 

 throughout the ensuing discussion we use figure simply in 
the sense of figure strictly so called ie to the exclusion of the first 
in order to avoid constant circumlocution 



new analytic of logical forms 

respect therefore to every true variation of syllogistic 
form what is called reduction is useless 

on the other hand if the conclusion afforded by 
a syllogism be onesided and indirect and its form 
therefore apparently imperfect or irregular there is 
good ground for suspicion that there is some com 
plexity or confusion in its form which it is necessary 
to disentangle or clear away before the syllogism 
emerges in its purity and before therefore its true 
form can be correctly determined when this con 
fusion or complexity is removed — and it is the office 
of logical analysis to accomplish this — the syllogism 
will appear in its real character and naturally fall 
under some determinate class of recognised syllogistic 
form to such a syllogism what is called reduction 
is obviously inapplicable since we cannot talk of re 
ducing a syllogism of a given form to itself thus 
on either alternative the doctrine of reduction seems 
alike inapplicable if not impossible if the syllo 
gistic form he essential reduction is useless if it he 
accidental it is absurd 

logicians however so far as we can understand the 
common doctrine seem to have chosen the former and 
perhaps milder alternative — that the figures are true 
variations of syllogistic form if this were not the case 
it would have been explicitly stated and in fact the 
doctrine of reduction itself is at once the evidence that 
they so regarded them and the proof that this is not 
their true character if they did not so consider them 



 new analytic of logical forms 

it is difficult to account for the existence of reduction 
at all for it is introduced expressly to strengthen 
the position of the figures and to vindicate to their 
conclusions the highest validity not clearly com 
prehending the true nature of the figures their doc 
trine respecting them was imperfect they deter 
mined that they were true syllogistic varieties but 
still felt that this was not perfectly satisfactory — that 
there was something wanting in their doctrine and 
in order to bestow upon it the requisite completeness 
they unhappily fell upon the doctrine of reduction — 
a process which so far from establishing the truth of 
that which it was introduced to demonstrate is the 
clearest evidence of its falsehood in fact we can 
not but regard the whole doctrine as the work of a 
most perverse and suicidal ingenuity introduced as 
a bulwark of strength to the figures it becomes the 
very mockery of their weakness and affords its sus 
taining aid only in the moment of their dissolution 
for we certainly cannot understand how a doubtful 
variation of syllogistic form is vindicated as valid and 
essential through a process which accomplishes its 
destruction in other words by being changed into 
a form of the validity of which there is no question 
but even granting that the whole doctrine was 
in the main correct it is chargeable with inconsis 
tencies of detail such as the explicit recognition at 
one time of a determinate major and minor premiss 
in the figures and the implicit denial of this at an 



new analytic of logical forms 

other these however it is not necessary now to 
notice suffice it to have shown that the related 
doctrines of figure and reduction are most seriously 
inconsistent if not mutually destructive of each other 

 the common doctrine is destructive of the science 
itself 

we bring this charge against the common doctrine 
— and it is the gravest of all — that it is destructive 
of the science by implicitly at least impeaching the 
veracity of the laws of thought upon which the science 
is founded 

this may be illustrated in one or two ways in all 
categorical syllogisms the reasoning is founded upon 
the law of identity that a whole is identical with all 
its parts a concept with its attributes c and thus 
that a part of a part is a part of the whole the 
reasoning therefore if it be valid always of necessity 
involves the subordination of one part to a whole 
through a larger part 

 this statement requires some modification for on the law of 
identity the reasoning from wholes to wholes is as competent as that 
from parts to wholes by this law we are entitled to infer the rela 
tion of identity between two wholes from the perception that they 
stand in this relation to a common third whole just as certainly as 
we are to infer the relation of inclusion between a given whole and 
part from the perception that these stand in the same relation to a 
common third part eg the reasoning all b is all a all c is all b 
therefore all c is all a is just as competent as the reasoning all b is 
a all c is b therefore all c is a taken absolutely therefore the 
objection stated in the text will not stand the test of criticism 
considered relatively to the common doctrine it is however valid 
on that doctrine all direct formal reasoning from wholes to wholes 

d 



 new analytic of logical forms 

now the common doctrine recognises the figures 
strictly so called as ultimate varieties of syllogistic 
form implicitly at least declares that they are 
simple forms and their reasoning valid as it stands 
but in these figures there is no subordination of lesser 
parts to wholes through larger parts 

it is therefore clear that if the law according to 
which all true reasoning is affirmed to proceed en 
joins this subordination but that there are found 
and recognised as valid forms in which there is no 
such subordination — that the law is no longer trust 
worthy for having proved mendacious once its 
character of necessity and universality has departed 
and it may deceive again thus implicitly at least 
the main foundation of all reasoning is cut away 

again we have seen in the common doctrine the 
numerical inequality of the moods under different 
figures in each figure some mood is determined as 
valid which is ignored by the rest thus throughout 
the whole scheme moods are retained as true at one 
time which are rejected as false at another 

now what is the test by which the validity and 

is impossible for a direct reasoning from wholes to wholes is only 
possible through the express quantification of the predicate which 
the forms and rules of the common doctrine alike forbid in every 
reasoning which obeys these rules the extent of some one term in 
the syllogism is necessarily left indeterminate so that its identity of 
extent with any other term cannot be formally inferred on the 
common doctrine the reasoning is thus necessarily from parts to 
wholes taken with this explanation therefore the statement in the 
text may stand 



new analytic of logical forms 

invalidity of any and every variet of syllogism is 
determined no other than its ohedience to or vio 
lation of the laws of thought if a syllogism agrees 
with these laws it is true if not it is false this 
criterion imperatively determines every possible va 
riation of syllogistic form if a syllogism be true 
to the laws of thought in its formal essence no acci 
dental irregularity or transposition in the arrange 
ment of its parts can render it invalid if it be not 
thus true in the inward essence of form no outward 
regularity of expression can supply the wanting 
validity in other words what the laws of thought 
allow no schematic difference can ever ignore what 
the laws of thought condemn no schematic variation 
can ever successfully vindicate 

in direct opposition to all this stands the common 
doctrine judged by the above standard its whole 
procedure is most illegal in its admissions and ex 
clusions of syllogistic variety it is equally capricious 
and empirical and throughout it is consistently 
regardless of the great laws by which the whole 
process as a logical procedure must be ever deter 
mined we find a certain mood rejected under a 
given figure — we presume because it is invalid but 
it can be invalid only because it violates the laws 
of thought presently after we find this same mood 
reappearing in another figure and recognised as 
scientifically true what the laws of thought ere 
while condemned the schematic difference now tri 



 new analytic of logical forms 

umphantly interposes to allow what we had sup 
posed to be rejected from the science as logically false 
now boldly returns under express scientific sanction 

thus on the common doctrine the accidents of 
arrangement triumph over the essentials of form 
the contingencies of expression are of higher authority 
than the necessities of thought in a formal science 
we have its accidental arrangement actually de 
throning its essential principles contingent and 
particular irregularities boldly usurping that author 
ity through the legitimate exercise of which they 
would have been themselves exiled — that authority 
through the recognition of which alone the science 
can be preserved — the authority of law necessary 
and universal 

if the procedure which issues in these results be 
competent then it is evident that logic exists no 
longer for the destruction of the science is ob 
viously involved in the destruction of the laws on 
which it is exclusively founded and this destruc 
tion of the laws of thought is as we have shown in 
effect accomplished by the common doctrine in the 
practical contradictions of these which its procedure 
involves it thus implicitly contains in it principles 
which if fully developed would overthrow logical 
science 

we have thus seen amongst the more general de 
fects which belong to the common doctrine that it 
is practically cumbrous and unsatisfactory that it 



new analytic op logical forms 

is theoretically inconsistent and that it involves 
principles destructive to the science itself the 
special falsity and uselessness of this doctrine will 
appear more fully in detail under the division to 
which we now proceed 

ii to state the one supreme canon of the new 
analytic which potentially contains the whole doctrine 
of categorical syllogisms and then to develop from it 
some parts of that doctrine 

that canon is — what worse relation of subject 
and predicate subsists between either of two terms 
and a common third term with which both are re 
lated and one at least positively so — that relation 
subsists between these two terms themselves 

this canon as we have said involves the whole 
doctrine of categorical syllogisms determines every 
kind of such syllogisms and is to them an allsuffi 
cient and exhaustive code of law observing which 
none can be formally invalid 

we have now to show in conformity with the pur 
pose of this essay in general and its third division in 
particular the influence which the principle of a 
quantified predicate has in accomplishing the reduc 
tion of syllogistic rules to this single canon 

and here it is obvious at once that before any 
such reduction of the general laws of these syllo 
gisms can take place the special laws which govern 
particular classes of such syllogisms must be dealt 



 new analytic of logical forms 

with in fact the condition of the possibihty of any 
such reduction of the general laws is the annihila 
tion of the special laws whatever therefore tends 
to effect the abolition of these special laws laws of 
the several figures to wit tends directly to facilitate 
that simplification of syllogistic law which emerges in 
the single canon the principle of a quantified pre 
dicate directly contributes to accomphsh this by 
proving the falsity and uselessness of these special 
rules 

for example the laws of hq first figure are — that 
the sumptioi be universal and — that the subsumption 
be ajffirmatwe quantify the predicate however and 
neither of these laws hold 

first rule falsified 
some men are some fleetfooted 
all rational is all man 
some rational is some fleetfooted 

second rule falsified 
all idealists are some philosophers 
no sensualist is any idealist 
no sensualist is some philosopher 

the laws of the second figure are — that one of the 
premises be negative and — that the sumption be uni 
versal to these the principle of a quantified predi 
cate immediately applies and falsifies them — 

first nde falsified 
all risible is all man 
all philosophers are some men 
all philosophers are some risible 



new analytic of logical forms 

second ride falsified 
some mortal is all man 
all rational is all man 
all rational is some mortal 

these examples may serve to illustrate specially 
the influence which the principle of a quantified pre 
dicate has upon these laws it is to be remarked 
however generally that these laws exist only in con 
sequence of a defective logical analysis and apply 
only to such an imperfection when the analysis 
therefore is complete these laws naturally fall away 
as henceforth useless and inapplicable the recog 
nition of a quantified predicate and of the true nature 
of figure renders this analysis complete thus the 
principle of a quantified predicate cooperating with 
the true doctrine of figure sweeps away for ever from 
logic as an encumbrance all these special laws the 
special laws being swept aside the way is prepared 
for the reduction of the general and this reduc 
tion effected there emerges the supreme canon as 
given above this canon it is obvious may be 
again easily evolved into those general laws of which 
it is the compend we may take as an example the 
two most general laws of categorical syllogisms 

 that both premises he not negative this is ex 
pressed in the canon by the clause — with which 
both are related and one at least positively so 

 that the middle term he distributed in one at 
least of the premises and it is of no consequence 



 ew analytic op logical forms 

whether it be distributed as the subject or the predi 
cate 

the first part of this law is expressed in the canon 
by the clause — related to a common middle term 
if it be common to both it must be distributed the 
latter part of the law is expressed in the clause — 
 what worse relation of subject and predicate sub 
sists between either of two terms and a common third 
term the common third term may thus be related 
to the two other terms either as subject or predicate 

it would be by no means difiicult to evolve in the 
same manner the canon into the six more general 
syllogistic laws commonly given by logicians the 
relation of these laws to the diiferent clauses of the 
supreme canon is however manifest and therefore 
need not be formally evolved here 

we pass on then to consider this canon in another 
aspect we said that it determined every kind of 
categorical syllogism 

we shall endeavour to illustrate this — 

 syllogisms differ with respect to the wholes in 
which they proceed 

we have already said that all reasoning deduc 
tive that is to which when not otherwise specified we 
always refer when speaking of reasoning in general 
is from whole to part but as there are two kinds of 
logical wholes and parts there will naturally be two 
kinds of reasoning corresponding severally to these 
different quantities these wholes are — the meta 



new analytic op logical fkm 

physical or comprehensive whole and the logical or 
extensive whole a syllogism proceeding in the for 
mer is a comprehensive syllogism in the conclusion 
of which the subject is the greatest whole and the 
predicate the smallest part a syllogism proceeding 
in the latter whole is an extensive syllogism in the 
conclusion of which the subject is the smallest part 
and the predicate the greatest whole these differ 
ent kinds of syllogism distinguished by the different 
kinds of wholes in which they proceed are determined 
by the first clause of the canon — what worse rela 
tion of subject and predicate subsists between two terms 
c in the whole of comprehension the predicate is 
avorse than the subject since it is a part in relation 
to a whole in the counter whole of extension the 
subject is worse than the predicate since in this 
quantity the predicate has become the greatest whole 
and the subject the smallest part 

 syllogisms differ with respect to figure 

the variation of figure arises as we have seen from 
the various positions of the middle terra in relation to 
the extremes this variation is evidently determined 
in the canon by the clause — what relation subsists 
between either of two terms and a common third term 

but here it is necessary to go somewhat more fully 
into detail we shall therefore return to the canon 
presently 

in considering figure somewhat more closely we 
shall notice — 



 new analytic op logical forms 

a the true nature of the figures 

we have seen that the figures strictly so called 
are regarded by logicians as true and original varia 
tions of the sjdlogistic form we have seen also some 
of the inconsistencies which such a doctrine involves 
enough certainly to beget a suspicion that it could 
not be the true one we were thus led to suppose 
that there must be some confusion or complexity in 
the figures which it is necessary to remove before the 
true form of their reasonings could be seen in its ul 
timate purity and exactness what this confusion or 
complexity is we now proceed explicitly to show by 
stating and illustrating the true nature of the figures 

 the figures strictly so called are hybrid or mixed 
reasonings in which the steps of the process are only 
partially expressed the unexpressed steps are in 
general only conversive inferences which we are en 
titled to make from those that are expressed 

this being the nature of figure it follows that 
since all the real steps of the process are not expressed 
in the reasonings the conclusion does not of necessity 
follow from the expressed premises but the mind 
at once inferring and interpolating the wanting steps 
of the process the conclusion follows in virtue of such 
inference and interpolation when this mental in 
terpolation is recognised and the real premise which 
it constitutes is expressed the sdlogism emerges in

through all the variations of mood and figure strictly 
so called a syllogism of the first figure all such 
varieties are therefore thus shown to be in their com 
plex state only unessential variations of that figure

the moods of the second and third figures

a syllogism in cesare is — 

no unreflective man is a philosopher 
all idealists are philosophers 
no idealist is unreflective 

by conversive inference we obtain as the real sump 
tion no philosopher is unreflective and this inter 
posed in the place of the ostensible sumption pro 
duces a syllogism in celarent of the first figure eg — 

no philosopher is unreflective 
all idealists are philosophers 
no idealist is unreflective 

a syllogism in gamestres is — 

all animals are sentient 
nothing unorganised is sentient 
nothing unorganised is animal 

we have already said when speaking generally of 
figure that the premises are in this syllogism trans 
posed and that but for such transposition it is exactly 
the same as gesare reversing the premises then and 



 new analytic of logical forms 

dealing with it in the same manner as the last it ap 
pears in the same form as celarent of the first figure 

nothing sentient is unorganised 
all animals are sentient 
no animal is unorganised 

a syllogism in festino is — 

no truly wise men go to extremes 

some truly religious men go to extremes 

some truly religious men are not truly wise men 

here with the sumption converted the syllogism 
appears as ferio of the first 

none who go to extremes are truly wise 
some truly religious men go to extremes 
some truly religious men are not truly wise 

a syllogism in baroco is — 

all lilies are fiagrant 

some flowers are not fragrant 

some flowers are not lilies 

here the subsumption is to be dealt with and by 
conversive influence we obtain some things not fra 
grant are flowers interpolating this we have a 
syllogism in darii of the first 

 the reduction of this mood was one of the standard difficulties 
of the logicians it could only at best be done with difficulty and 
through the clumsy process designated ad impossihile nor does it 
accommodate itself well to this expository process of kants since 
after all it appears as a syllogism of the fourth figure rather than of 
thers 



new analytic of logical forms 

all lilies are fragrant 

some things not fragrant are flowers 

some things not lilies are flowers 

the third figure 

we have seen in removing the complexity of syl 
logisms in the second figure that it is the sumption 
for the most part that is in three out of four moods 
which is aftected by conversive inference and that 
that inference is made chiefly from the absolute 
negation of the first notion as predicate of the second 
to the absolute negation of the second notion as pre 
dicate of the first in the third figure on the other 
hand it is the subsumption which is chiefly affected 
by conversive inference and that inference is generally 
made from the total or partial affirmation of a 
lesser notion of a greater to the partial affirmation 
of the greater notion of the lesser 

the moods of the third figure are — darapti felap 
ton disamis datisi bocardo ferison 

a syllogism in darapti is — 

every good man is happy 

every good man fights with himself 

some who fight with themselves are happy 

by conversive inference we here obtain as sub 
sumption — some who fight with themselves are good 
men and the syllogism is then in darii of the first 
figure 

every good man is happy 

some who fight with themselves are good men 

some who fight with themselves are happy 



 new analytic op logical forms 

a syllogism in the second mood felapton is — 

no man is winged 
all men are bipeds 
some bipeds are not winged 

by converting the subsumption it becomes ferio of 
the first 

no man is winged 
some bipeds are men 
some bipeds are not winged 

j syllogism in the third mood disamis is — 

some patriots are persecuted 

every patriot is brave 

some that are brave are persecuted 

here the premises are first to be transposed then 
converting the subsumption the syllogism appears as 
darii of the first— 

every patriot is brave 

some that are persecuted are patriots 

some that are persecuted are brave 

with respect to the fourth mood in the figure 
datisi we have already shown that it differs from the 
third only in the transposition of its premises con 
verting the subsumption therefore it appears in the 
same form as darii of the first we give the syllo 
gisms together — 

all true philosophers are truly noble 
some true philosophers are despised 
some that are truly noble are despised 



kew analytic of logical forms 

all true philosophers are truly noble 

some that are despised are true philosophers 

some that are despised are truly noble 

a syllogism in the fifth mood bocardo is — 

some poets are not philosophers 

all poets have genius 

some who have genius are not philosophers 

the premises are here transposed and the sump 
tion converted — it then appears as darii — 

all poets have genius 

some not philosophers are poets 

some not philosophers have genius 

a syllogism in the last mood ferison is — 

no hope is unattended with pleasure 

some hopes are delusive 

some delusive things are attended with pleasure 

converting the sumption it becomes ferio of the 
first — 

no hope is without pleasure 

some delusive things are hopes 

some delusive things are attended with pleasure 

the syllogisms of the figures strictly so called 
are thus shown to be complex reasonings which 
when cleared of their complexity and simply ex 
pressed ie expressed in that form which all true 
reasonings must ultimately assume in which the least 
part or whole is subordinated to the greatest part or 
whole through a lesser part or whole — appear in 
their true character as syllogisms of the first figure 



 isew analytic of logical forms 

we have here taken no notice of the fourth figure 
not because the same process of simplification is not 
equally applicable to its reasonings as to those of the 
second and third figures but because as we shall 
presently explain we do not consider it properly a 
figure at all 

h the true number of the figures 

we have seen that in the common doctrine four 
figures are recognised as valid the fourth figure 

 the validity of the fourth figure as a separate form of reasoning 
has been often contested but that of the other three has remained 
for the most part unassailed the third however has not wholly 
escaped assault it was rejected by laurentius valla on the ground 
that such a form of reasoning was never used that there are no 
examples of it to be found and as it would seem as much as for any 
other reason because it offended his eye or ear he does not in 
deed so much reason seriously against its validity but rather de 
nounces it at once and that too in the most lively and rhetorical 
manner as in the last degree preposterous and absurd the whole 
style of the rejection is quite in harmony with his wayward original 
ity and independence as well as with his habit of rash yet fastidious 
criticism it is indeed but another instance of the fastidious taste 
of valla in whose eyes a sin against purity of style was a moral 
offence of the gravest kind who did not scruple to correct the latinity 
of cicero and of whose criticism it is said the devil himself stood in 
such awe that he was afraid to speak in his presence being nervous 
as to the classic purity of his latin style 

the objections of valla to the third figure were rebutted by lazarus 
schonerus as quoted by fraunce who adduced examples of its use 
from cicero and virgil its validity and usefulness were also defended 
against valla by melanchthon who referring to it says laurentius 
valla non leviter stomachatur hoc loco et aristotelem tanquam 
capitali judicio accusat qui banc figuram tradiderit sed valla dum 
nullum rixandi finem facit saepe etiam incurrit ut sit ab iracundis 
in illos qui nihil peccaverunt mihi non tam plumbeo ingenio aris

was however introduced into the science later and 
when introduced obtained a footing less secure than 
the other three some logicians indeed have omitted 
it altogether while others have expressly redargued 
its claim to be admitted as a true schematic difference 
the reasons of those who opposed its admission have 
not however proved sufficiently strong to eject it 
finally from the science since it reappears in the latest 
systems and is recognised as logically competent it 
is nevertheless to be rejected from logic as being 
utterly deformed and useless deformed since its 
premises proceed in the whole of comprehension and 
its conclusion in the counter whole of extension 
useless since the reasoning in both these wholes is 
scientifically complete without it the fourth figure 
being thus rejected the three first alone remain 
these therefore are to be considered as exclusively 
competent in logic 

c the true canons of the figures 

we have said that the syllogistic diflference of 

toteles fuisse yidetur xi nulla de causa tertiam figuram tradiderit 
est eniiii reperire exempla ejus figura in quibus si mutes disposi 
tionem medii feceris totum syllogismum obseuriorem dialeetica

this extract is taken from melanchthons secoid logical work his 
opinion in relation to this matter does not appear to have been always 
equally decided since melchior adam says in his short life of him 
referring to it edidit philippus eodem anno primura sua 
pialectica in quibus tertiam jiguram syllogismorum neque recipit 
neque rejicit quara deinde iterata editione an admisit vits

figure is determined in the supreme canon of syllogism 
bj the clause what worse relation of subject and 
predicate subsists between either of two terms and a 
common third term c it is obvious that this 
clause determines figure for the syllogistic differ 
ence of figure is discriminated by the position of the 
middle term in relation to the extremes or in other 
words by the relation of subject and predicate 
subsisting between the two terms and a common third 
term 

but this clause not only determines the difference of 
figure it also immediately determines all the possible 
varieties of such difference for the relation of sub 
ject and predicate subsisting between two terms and 
a common third term must be either that in which 
the common third term is the subject of one and 
the predicate of the other or that in which it is the 
predicate of both or that in which it is the subject 
of both no other is possible now these three 
possible variations of relation determine at once the 
number of the figures and the canons by which they 
are regulated for the number of different figures 
can only answer to the number of different relations 
and the evolution of these different relations in de 
tail will be the expression of the laws by which the 
figures thus discriminated are severally governed 

these relations are — 

i that in ivhich the common third term is the 



new analytic of logical forms 

subject of one of the terms and the predicate of the 
other 

this constitutes the first figure alike in extension 
and comprehension 

first in extension 

b is a here b the third term is the subject of 

c is b that is to say contained under a 

c is a the one term and the predicate of 

that is to say contains under it c 

the other term 

so in comprehension 

c is b here b the middle term is the predi 

b is a cate of that is to say comprehended 

c is a in c the one term and the subject 

of that is to say comprehends in it 

a the other terra 

the canon of this figure is — in so far as two no 
tions or terms are related either both positively or 
one positively and the other negatively to a common 
third term of which the one is subject and the other 
predicate — these two notions are related positively 
or negatively to each other as subject and predi 
cate 

ii that in which the common third term is the 
predicate of both the other terms 

this constitutes the second figure and that con 
trary to the logicians is either of affirmative or of 
negative syllogisms 



 new analytic of logical forms 

affirmative negative 

all a is all b all a is all b 

all c is some b no c is any b 

all c is some a no c is any a 

the canon of this figure is — in so far as two terms 
or notions both subjects are either both positively 
or the one positively and the other negatively re 
lated to a common predicate — in so far are they 
either positively or negatively subject and predicate 
and that indifferently of each other 

iii that in which the third term is the subject of 
both the other terms 

this constitutes the third figure and that also 
contrary to the logicians in syllogisms with either 
universal or particular conclusions 

universal particular 

all b is some a all b is all a 

all b is all c some b is some c 

all c is some a some c is some a 

the canon of this figure is — in so far as two no 
tions or terms both predicates are either each posi 
tively or the one positively and the other negatively 
related to a common subject — in so far are they 
positively or negatively subject and predicate and 
this indifferently of each other 

the relation of the middle term in the second and 
third figures explains how it is that these figures have 
no determinate major or minor premise and two in 



xew analytic of logical forms 

different conclusions there can be no determinate 
major or minor premise for a determinate major 
premise is one in which the middle term is compared 
with the greatest notion and determined by it a 
determinate minor premise one in which the middle 
term is compared with the smallest notion and de 
termines it the middle notion thus always is in the 
former determined in the latter determining now 
in the second and third figures there can be no such 
relation of determination in one the middle term 
determines both the premises in the other it is deter 
mined by both hence since there is no determinate 
major or minor premise it is manifest that we may 
have two indifferent conclusions for we may in the 
second figure indifferently predicate one subject of 
the other and in third the one predicate of the other 

in the first figure again it is equally clear that 
there is such a relation of determination in it the 
reasoning is perfect proceeding from the largest whole 
through a lesser whole to the least whole the first 
figure accordingly has a determinate major and minor 
premise and one immediate conclusion 

d the true relations of the figures 

we have already spoken of the two wholes in which 
reasoning proceeds — the whole of comprehension and 
that of extension — the characteristic of the former 
being that the predicate is contained in the subject of 
the latter that the subject is contained under the predi 
cate this being remembered it will appear that in 



 new analytic of logical fokms 

the second figure where the middle term as predicate 
contains both the subjects under it extension will pre 
dominate in the third where the middle term as 
subject is contained under and therefore comprehends 
in it both the predicates comprehension will prevail 
in the first figure again where the middle term is 
both subject and predicate extension and comprehen 
sion balance each other the first figure is indiffer 
ently competent to either 

reasoning however proceeds not only in different 
wholes but in different aspects of the same whole 
we may it is evident regard any whole considered 
as the complement of its parts in either of two ways 
for we may on the one hand look from the whole to 
the parts and reason accordingly downwards or 
on the other hand look from the parts to the whole 
they constitute and reason accordingly upwards 
the former of these reasonings is called deductive 
the latter inductive deductive reasoning is founded 
on the maxim — what belongs to the containing 
whole belongs also to the contained parts induction 
on the contrary maxim — what belongs to the con 
stituent parts belongs also to the constituted whole 
thus in deductive reasoning the whole is stated first 
and what is affirmed of it is affirmed of the parts it 
contains in other words a general law is laid down 
and predicated of the particular instances to which 
it applies in inductive reasoning the parts are first 
stated and what is predicated of them is also predi 



new analytic of logical forms 

cated of the whole they constitute in other words 
the particular instances are first stated as facts and 
then the law they constitute is evolved 

this being the nature of these counter and corre 
lative reasonings it appears to us that though each 
kind is competent in either whole extension or com 
prehension yet that the reasoning in the whole of 
extension is more naturally allied to the deductive 
and that in comprehension to the inductive for in 
the whole of extension the reasoning proceeds from 
the general to the special — from the abstract to the 
concrete — from general laws to the particulai in 
stances which are contained under them while in 
that of comprehension on the other hand the rea 
soning proceeds from the special to the general — 
from the concrete to the abstract — from the parti 
cular instances to the general laws whose operation 
they exemphf 

the special adaptation of comprehension for induc 
tive and of extension for deductive reasoning might 
be illustrated more fully in detail and on other 
grounds but it may perhaps suffice to have indi 
cated the relation between the two kinds of reasoning 
and the two counter wholes in which they proceed 

considering these kinds of reasoning in relation to 
the figures it will appear then that since extension 
prevails in the second that will be so far more suit 
able for deductive reasoning and since comprehension 
prevails in the third that figure will so far be more 



 kew analytic of logical fokms 

adapted for inductive reasoning while since exten 
sion and comprehension prevail equally in the first 
that figure will be equally fitted for either kind of 
reasoning 

 the relation of the figures to these different kinds of reasoning 
will be best illustrated by an example we will take first the second 
figure — ¦ 

deductive reasoning quantity of eictension 
 endowed with reason is all man 
j european asiatic african american are all man 
 european asiatic african american are endowed with 
v reason 
here the reasoning is deductive for the law is first enounced the 
indiviflual instances are next brought under it and it is then affirmed 
of them j it is emensive for it proceeds from the wider notion through 
the narrower to the individual let us now take the same terms and 
treat them inductively beginning with the individuals the reason 
ing will then be in the whole of comprehension and will naturally 
appear in the form of the third figure — 

inductive reasoning quantity of comfreheixsion 
 european asiatic african american are all man 

 european asiatic african american are endowed with 
pig iii 

i reason 

 endowed with reason is all man 

here the reasoning is inductive for beginning with the individual 
in the premises we arrive at the law with which we started in the 
previous syllogism in the conclusion it is comjrehensive or inten 
sive for it proceeds from the concrete to the abstract from a greater 
totality of attribute to a less in other words in either quantity 
extensive or intensive we reason from the greatest whole but in 
the quantity of extension the greatest whole is the most abstract 
notion ie the widest law whereas in that of comprehension the 
greatest whole is the most concrete notion ie the individual in 
stance but proceeding thus from the widest law the reasoning 
is necessary deductive while on the other hand proceeding from 
the individual instance it is as necessarily inductive 



new analytic of logical forms 

the second and third figures are indeed naturally 
respectively connected with deductive and inductive 

we may give the same example in the first figure to illustrate 
what will now be quite obvious that it is indifferently competent

i need scarcely say that at the time of writing the essay i was 
quite unaware that any of these special relations of the figures had 
been noticed by logicians i find however that wilson in his rule 
of reason has among other remarks tracing the use of the 
figures the following — use of the third figure this figure profiteth 
much in provoking particular things and gathering of conjectures in 
causes that are doubtful when probability only and no assured 
knowledge boulteth out the truth of a matter and because several 
things individuals come sonest to our senses we use suche gather 
ing moste commonly and by triall of particular causes assure our 
selves of the truthe generally again when we make an argu 
ment and procede from the general word genus to the kind species 
it is in the first figure and even by our reason we learn this that if 
the greater bee not the lesse cannot bee 

 when we procede from the kinde to the general making the con 
clusion particular the argument is in the third figure and this 
for ever true that when the kinde is rehearsed the generall must 
needes fouowe fol this however is little beyond a more 
explicit statement of what is commonly said of the thiid figure that 
it is a reasoning from the special 



 new analytic of logical forms 

reasoning for in the second we judge the likeness 
or unhkeness of two parts as they are contained or 
not contained by a common whole while in the 
third we judge the likeness or unlikeness of two 
wholes as they severally contain or do not contain 
common parts 

 syllogisms differ with respect to mood 

the syllogistic variety of mood arises from the 
different quality and quantity of propositions and 
this difference is determined by the supreme canon 
in the clause — what worse relation of subject and 
predicate kc since a negative quality is a worse 
relation than a positive and a particular quantity a 
worse relation than a universal 

logicians however in their enumeration of moods 
as we have seen have taken into account only one 
quantity of propositions have considered the subject 
as quantified to the exclusion of the predicate and 
have in so doing deformed their science by excluding 
from it many valid forms of reasoning — forms which 
logic if it be an exact science and its analysis of the 
form of thought exhaustive is bound to recognise and 
vindicate as valid 

it is the design of the new analytic that its 
analysis shall be thus exhaustive and it vindicates 
its title by discovering and developing in its various 
relations an element of formal thought which had 
remained undeveloped if not unrecognised in every 
previous analysis that element is as we have 



new analytic of logical forms 

said the express quantification of the predicate the 
true application of which recalls to the science many 
true forms of reasoning the date of whose logical 
proscription may be reckoned as coeval with that of 
the science itself 

we shall proceed briefly to vindicate these forms 
logicians combining the quality of a proposition with 
the quantity of its subject reckon in all four kinds 
of propositions and combining these propositions in 
every possible way evolve sixtyfour moods but 
it is clear that if the quantity of the predicate be 
taken into account the various kinds of propositions 
discriminated by quantity and quality will be doubled 
in number and a proportionate increase effected in 
the number of possible moods for we shall now 
have eight kinds of propositions viz four affirma 
tive — 

definite affirmative definite 

definite affirmative indefinite 

indefinite affirmative definite 

indefinite affirmative indefinite 

and in the same manner four negative propositions 
with this increase in the number of propositions we 
need new symbols by which to designate them we 
may however still retain the old notation a i e 
and express the new forms by combining the letters 
into diphthongs or placing them within brackets as 
occasion may require eg — 

definite affirmative indefinite al 
indefinite negative definite ce c 



 



new akalyllc of logical fokms 



this increase in the number of propositions to be 
combined effects of course a great increase in the 
number of moods resulting from such combination 
of the possible moods thus given a number are in 
vakdated by the clause of the canon oie at least 
positively so from having two negative premises 
a number more are excluded by the clause a com 
mon third term from the middle term being undis 
tributed throwing these out of account together 
with some others having particular conclusions where 
universal are competent there remain in all thirty 
six valid moods twelve affirmative and twentyfour 
negative and these thirtysix are valid in each 
figure

we have given the above syllogisms in the first 
figure but they may all be easily translated into 
the two others 



 the only one of the prescribed requisites which the essay does 



 new analytic of logical forms 

to recapitulate then we set out with the prin 
ciple of a quantified predicate we have noticed 
some things by the way not immediately connected 
therewith but recurring to it we have endeavoured 
to vindicate that principle we have indicated its 
influence on propositions in abolishing the complex 
doctrine of conversion its influence on categorical 
syllogisms in reducing their laws to a higher sim 
plicity and amplifying their vakd forms — in short 
by correcting what was false and supplying what was 
wanting and thus by securing to logic a higher 
degree of formal exactness realising for it a higher 
degree of scientific perfection 

not to some extent attempt to meet is that in which it is required 
 to show in concrete examples through all the moods the unessen 
tial variation which figure makes in a syllogism this was omitted 
at the time of writing through haste but it is so obvious that with 
a little trouble each reader may do it for himsel£ as an illustration 
however the following is a concrete example of the first mood car 
ried through all the figures — 

 all man is some animal 
fig every celt is some man 

 every celt is some animal 

i some animal is all man 
fig ii j every celt is some man 

 every celt is some animal 

r all man is some animal 
fig iii some man is every celt 

 some animal is every celt 

 some animal is all man 
fig iv some man is every celt 

 some animal is every celt 



new analytic of logical forms 

the neiv analytic accomplishes this by being 
true to its office and fully investigating the form of 
thought the form the whole form and nothing hut 
the form of thought is indeed the bannered motto 
which it bears on its triumphant way true to 
its purpose it advances over the whole region of 
formal thought conquering and to conquer de 
stroying the false landmarks which had been set 
up by the early discoverers of that territory re 
pressing the incursions which were continually made 
into neighbouring kingdoms destroying the border 
ground by determining for ever the frontier line 
dethroning the potentates who had intrenched them 
selves in its high places and long there exer 
cised a usurped authority recalling from their 
long exile the true lords of the soil reestablish 
ing the laws on which their rights were founded and 
enforcing strict obedience to these in every province 
of the empire thus though in some respects its 
path is as the path of the destroyer in a higher and 
truer sense it is the path of peace for through its 
instrumentality there breaks at length upon this long 
distracted region the golden age of simphcity and 
order and anarchy the result of laws neglected 
and rights ignored is for ever abolished in the esta 
blishment of perfect harmony — a harmony the result 
of law clearly expounded and rigidly obeyed through 
out the entire empire of formal thought

in conclusion we are well aware of the very im 
perfect manner in which we have signalised those 
parts of the new discovery on which we have touched 
we cannot however close without expressing the 
true joy we feel though were the feeling less strong 
we might shrink from the intrusion that in our 
country and in our time this discovery has been 
made we rejoice to know that one has at length 
arisen able to recognise and complete the plan of the 
mighty builder aristotle— to lay the topstone on 
that fabric the foundations of which were laid more 
than two thousand years ago by the master hand of 
the stagirite which after the labours of many gene 
rations of workmen who have from time to time built 
up one part here and taken down another there — re 
mains substantially as he left it but which when 
finished shall be seen to be an edifice of wondrous 
beauty harmony and completeness 



appendix 



no i 

historical notice touching the explicit quantification 
of the predicate 

the statement made in the first page of the essay that the 
principle of a quantified predicate had in its full scientific sig 
nificance been totally overlooked by logicians and that when 
noticed at all it had for the most part been referred to only to 
be discarded as useless if not to be condemned as false — was 
made it scarcely need be said upon a very limited acquaintance 
with logical works it was however the conclusion to which 
my inquiries so far as they extended led me i had examined 
several logical treatises and found that the majority made no re 
ference at all to a quantified predicate that the few who noticed 
it two of which are quoted treated it in the manner described 
in the text while so far as my reading extended i had not 
found a single instance in which it was admitted in any form 
since writing the essay i have naturally been curious in my 
occasional logical reading to mark any references which might 
be made to this subject and as the result of a somewhat fuller 
knowledge of the historical development of the science i am able 
to establish upon somewhat wider evidence the general truth 
of the statement made in the text the full scientific signifi 
cance of the principle certainly never has been appreciated it 
has been for the most part rejected that is to say it 
has been denounced by the vast majority of logicians as 



 appendix 

useless and false some exceptions however to this sum 
mary rejection of the principle are to be found a few of these 
i have met with some of which as in themselves curious and 
as lying out of the way of ordinary reading it may be worth 
while explicitly to notice in order therefore to place the essay 
on a level with my present knowledge i shall briefly establish 
historically the common rejection of the principle of a quantified 
predicate and then notice some of the exceptions to this treat 
ment of it which are to be found 

i the common doctrine which altogether rejects the express quan 
tification of the predicate 

this doctrine dates substantially as do most logical truths 
and heresies from aristotle he refers explicitly in two 
places — in his book on the doctrine of enunciation and in his 
prior analytics — to the quantification of the predicate and 
in both rejects it in a very summary manner in the book 
touching enunciation he says — et hs rou xarriyopovfisvou

anal pri i c § the quantification of the predicate is 
to be absolutely rejected such is the judgment of aristotle on 
the pointf that this judgment vas given rashly and without 

 other references are made to the subject by aristotle in the book of the 
categories and the posterior analytics but the above are the most decisive 



 it is right to state that the only case which is here explicitly contem 
plated by aristotle is that in which the predicate is quantified unitersally 
his dictum however in relation to this is not true since we may often 



appendix 

due consideration is however manifest both from the fact that 
aristotle himself explicitly quantifies the predicate in other parts 
of his writings as also from the fact that his formal rejection of 
such quantification is unsupported by a single argument all 
that is offered in its defence is an illustration so inept and one 
sided that its fallacy seems almost transparent he says in 
effect that it is impossible to quantify the predicate because it 
is false to say all man is all anirnal which is surely no better 
as an argument than it would be to say that it is impossible to 
divide a foot into inches because it is false to say that one inch 
is a whole foot with the exception of this example and one 
or two others of the same kind aristotle wisely abstains from 
offering any defence of his hasty judgment his wisdom in 
this respect has not however been imitated by his followers 
who have in various ways endeavoured to explain and defend 
the dictum of their master 

passing over the greek commentators with whose labours 
i am not sufhciently familiar to enable me to speak of them 
with confidence we come to the first as in some respects he 
still remains the best latin expositor of aristotle — boethius 
boethius flourished during the latter part of the fifth and the 
beginning of the sixth centuries he translated all the books 
of the organon and wrote elaborate commentaries on more 
than one besides furnishing other and more direct contributions 
to logical science in the form of original treatises to his ver 
sions and commentaries the schoolmen were mainly indebted 
for their knowledge of aristotle and to these accordingly 
may be traced several of the particular interpretations which 
subsequently became current in the science and were indeed 
for the most part authenticated as of aristotelic origin to deter 
mine therefore the opinion of boethius on any particular point 

quantify the predicate universally but as he implicitly makes this case re 
presentative of the whole doctrine it is obviously altogether false since we 
may and must always quantify the predicate unirersalli or particularly 

univeksitr 



s appendix 

is of some importance as it will be often found to be that which 
subsequently prevailed 

he gives the point in question fuller consideration than it 
receives at the hands of aristotle but in his treatment of it 
nevertheless he confines himself to the same restricted aspect 
and arrives substantially at the same onesided conclusion 
considering exclusively the case in which the predicate is 
quantified universally he proves triumphantly what seems to re 
quire really very little proof that the genus cannot receive a 
mark of universal quantity when it is predicated of its species 
commenting on the passage already quoted from the book 
touching enunciation he says as follows — 

quod dicit hujusmodiest — omnis propositio simplex duobus 
terminis constat his saepe additur aut universalitatis aut particu 
laritatis determinatio sed ad quani partem hae determinationes 
addantur exponit yidetur enim aristoteli praedicato termino

in the opening sentence of this corrected extract boethius 
states the question fairly and looks at it from a higher point of 
view than that in which it had been considered by aristotle 
he begins by saying that every simple proposition is composed 
of two terms that to these a determination of universality or par 
ticularity is often added and then proceeds to inquire to which 
of the terms these determinations should be affixed from this 
introduction it might reasonably have been inferred that the 
question would be discussed on broader grounds than those on 
which it had previously been treated and that quantification in 
relation to the predicate would be considered in its generic lati 
tude and not in one of its species alone this expectation is 



 appendix 

however as we have said not fulfilled for immediately after 
having said that the terms receive marks o universality ii par 
ticularity and that the inquiry is to which of the terms these 
marks should be appended boethius proceeds to consider the 
mark of universality alone and decides on this restricted con 
sideration of the matter that the marks of quantity are to be 
affixed exclusively to the subject and never to the predicate 

the whole passage is however curious and valuable not only 
in itself but also in its historic relation from its having as al 
ready hinted determined in effect nearly all that was subse 
quently said by others on the subject there is not i think in 
all the subsequent refutations of a quantified predicate which 
have been attempted a single argument which is not substan 
tially contained in this quotation 

the next name of authority after boethius is that of the 
arabian averroes who from the extent and value of his labours 
as expositor of aristotle was called the commentator xar 
soytjv he flourished in the twelfth century and by his almost 
incredible devotion to aristotle and his unwearied zeal in ex 
pounding and epitomising his works contributed not a little to 
promote the complete ascendency which the peripatetic philo 
sophy subsequently obtained 

averroes treats the point in question with much greater 
brevity than boethius but arrives at precisely the same con 
clusion 

in his commentary on the passage in the book of enunciation 
he says et non dividuntur enunciationes ex parte conjunc 
tionis clausura cum praedicato quia clausura cum adjungitur 
pradicato est falsa euunciatio aut superfua et falsa quidem est 
 omnis homo est omne animal superflua sicut cum diximus 
 omnis homo est quoddam animav averrois opera omnia venet 
 tom i fol he has another sentence to the same 
effect in his commentary on the twentyseventh chapter of the 
first book of the prior analytics it is as follows — oportet 



appendix 

ut sepimentum hoc est determinatio semper coaptetur subjecto 
propositionis acceptae non autem prcedicato quoniam si conjun 
getur praidicato erit aut impossihilis aut inutilis ad syllogisraum 
secundum quod declaratum fuit in libro praecedente fol 

the first of these extracts from averroes though so brief is 
curious inasmuch as he there explicitly takes account of what 
is not noticed by aristotle or boethius before him or as far as 
i remember by any of the rejectors of a quantified predicate 
after him — the case to wit in which the predicate is quantified 
particularly he considers with aristotle first the case in 
which it is quantified universally all man is all animal and 
with him rejects this as false and impossible he then pro 
ceeds to consider the case in which it is quantified particularly 
 all man is some animal here he was free to act as he would 
for of this second case nothing had been said but the spell of 
aristotles rejection of the universal quantification was still 
strong upon him and accordingly he rejects the particular also 
as superfluous and useless the grounds of this rejection are it 
need scarcely be said totally extralogical for the particular 
quantification of the predicate in the given example is superfluous 
only by an appeal to the matter of the proposition with which 
logic has nothing whatever to do and so far from being useless 
such quantification is absolutely necessaiy before the predicate 
notion as the constituent of a reasoning can be turned to its 
full scientific account 

from boethius and averroes the logical treatises of aristotle 
with the traditions founded upon them passed as we have said 
to the schoolmen among these albertus magnus and st tho 
mas aquinas are quoted as having anew defended the rejec 
tion of a quantified predicate the hereditary confession of 
logical faith now become venerable through constant subscrip 
tion passed from the schoolmen to the later commentators on 
the organon these while throwing off to a great extent 
the formality of the scholastic style are yet rarely wise in imr 



 appendix 

portant points above the teaching of their masters on the 
point in question that of a quantified predicate they seem to 
have remained with scarcely an exception faithful to the re 
ceived traditions in illustration of this we will take two 
which are among the best and most valuable of the later com 
mentaries on the organon that of julius pacius and that of the 
college of the society of jesus at coimhra 

julius pacius the pupil of zabarella and preceptor in philoso 
phy of casaubon was both a very learned and a very acute man 
and his works accordingly exhibit the accuracy and penetration 
resulting from these blended excellencies his commentary on 
the organon was first published in the year it was so 
full clear and precise and altogether such a useful book 
that it speedily attained a high reputation and has ever since 
maintained its place as a standard work on the organon pacius 
discusses the question of a quantified predicate in connexion with 
both the passages which we have quoted from the organon 
and as his opinion in this matter stands in much the same rela 
tion to the later philosophy as that of boethius did to the earlier 
it may be worth while to quote it in full the more so too as it 
is in itself the fullest discussion of the matter probably to be 
found among the later writers 

the first passage is from his commentary on the book of 
enunciation it is as follows — 

 in duabus primis particulis sejunxerat indefinitas ab uni 
versahbus quoniam universales subjecto universali addunt 
notam universalem omnis vel nullus indefinitas vero nullam 
notam subjecto apponunt unde potuisset aliquis suspicari 
tale discrimen quod modo exposuimus in subjecto nempe 
recipere notam universalem aut ea nota carere tale in 
quam discrimen etiam in attribute spectari posse quasi vel 
simpliciter proponi possit vel cum nota universali hunc er 
rorem ut aristoteles tollat ostendit universalem notam nunquam 
posse adjungi attributo quia tunc omnis afiirmatio falsa esset

esset quodlibet sensu prseditum proinde hac ratione fieret ut 
homo esset equus et bos quandoquidem equus et bos sunt

the second passage is from the commentary on the prior 
analytics and is as follows — 

 quintum prasceptum est ne sumamus consequens quod 
totam consequatur sed quod toti sit consequens id est ut nota 
universalis omnis vel omne jungatur subjecto non attributo pro

etiamsi non sumas esse omne animal tamen recte colliges 
omnem hominem vivere postremo cum ait sed cui aliud 
concludit universalem illam notam omnis esse subjecto adjun 
gendam pacius in arist analyt pri i cap § 

the commentary on the organon by the college of coimbra 
was first published in the year a few years after that of 
pacius it was one of those able works on philosophy to 
which after the decline of scholasticism the zeal and energy of 
the jesuits in letters and philosophy gave birth it is far 
from being a mere slavish transcript from previous writers but 
has on the contrary acuteness and originality enough to enable 
it to stand out in its individuality from the works of the time 
in relation to the point in question it is however in harmony 
with its predecessors and contemporaries the following is its 
deliverance on the matter — 

 docuerat aristoteles in propositionibus universalibus signa 
universalia addi subjecto ambigeret quis an praedicato etiam 
addi oporteret ut quemadmodum dicimus omnis homo est 
animal libeat ita loqui omnis homo est omne animal re

appendix

i confess that boethius and averroes appear to me to be but 
hardly treated in the above passage in being held guilty of error 
for saying that the universal quantification of the predicate 
when it was equal in extent to the subject was simply super 
fluous instead of denouncing it as false boethius indeed as 
we have seen hypothetically does the latter but considers the 
whole case with far greater wisdom than his censor since he 
says in relation to it that the quantification is superfluous if the 
subject be taken collectively but false if it be taken distributively 
with the exception of the admission that the predicate of a 
negative judgment may be quantified without making the 
proposition false the above extract is at one with the previous 
authorities 

keckermann adds nothing new save one example which is 
however something where the whole question is solved by 
examples if possible still more inept not to say absurd 
than the common ones a number of other logical writers 
about equal in authority to keckermann such as burgersdyk 



 appendix 

hereboord stahl derodon c might be referred to as giving 
deliverances to the same effect there is nothing however in 
their statement of the common opinion that merits special atten 
tion or that need be quoted here 

such is the position which the opinion of the illegality of 
quantification in relation to the predicate has maintained in the 
history of the science it has been held from the earliest to the 
latest times nor is it by any means yet obsolete with the 
exception of the comparatively few quarters in which sir w 
hamiltons refutation of the old and application of the new doc 
trine have become known it is as firmly and as widely held to 
day as it ever was the marvellous acuteness of kant in rela 
tion to everything connected with formal thought which did 
good service in other parts of logic brought no help here nor 
has the newlykindled zeal on behalf of aristotle and his philo 
sophy manifested in germany and france been of any more 
avail the last german editor of the organon theo waitz 
still says on the classical passage in the book of enunciation — 
 quum additur omnis non id de quo praedicatur univer 
sale esse significatur sed de re aliqua universa aliquid prse 
dicari judicatur si vero quod praedicatur quum univer 
sale est universum prasdicatur enunciatio exit non vera — 
aristotelis organon edidit t waitz pars i p 
finally the last french translator and expositor of aristotle m 
j b saint hilaire in his excellent version of the organon 



 stahl and derodon have been quoted already in the essay while 
referring again to stahl may mention here what ought to have been 
stated in the note respecting him at page viz that in what he says of 
comprehension and extension he but repeats cajetanus quoted indeed him 
self to the same effect ear her in his work reg plul p the work of 
cajetanus on the categories from which stahl quotes dates from so 
that the discrimination of these quantities by the epithets cxtemlxe and in 
tensive is of some antiquity the term intensire was commonly employed 
in the leibnitian school in the same sense and was probably revived by 
leibnitz immediately from cajetanus or mediately through stahl 



appendix 

still reiterates without a reason in his notes the rejection of the 
text — lattribut na jamais la marque duniversalite et ion 
ne saurait dire tout homme est tout animal on dit simple 
ment et dune maniere absolue tout homme est animal le 
signe duniversalite nest jamais qu a iantecedent eestadire 
au sujet — lofjique dartstote trad paris tom ii 
p 

to sum up then the evidence we have obtained the whole 
question as commonly treated by the logicians may be stated 
as follows — the predicate they consider with a single excep 
tion can only be quantified universally now this being the 
only possibility contemplated two cases arise for either in the 
first place the predicate is greater than the subject and then such 
quantification is false as all man is all animal or it is equal 
to the subject and then such quantification is superfluous as all 
man is all risible the later commentators however are not 
satisfied with this comparatively mild dismissal of the second 
case but maintain that in any case in the latter as well as in 
the former the quantification is necessarily ase and this on 
the apparently inconceivably inconsequent ground that if azz man 
is all risible then necessarily each man is all risible or to take 
a parallel example one however which they do not take 
that if twelve inches are one foot then necessarily each individual 
inch is also one foot 

when we consider these grounds and remember the real 
ability of the men by whom they were successively urged we 
cannot but be struck with a wonder amounting to marvel that 
they could remain satisfied with them and that a truth so obvious 
on its first enunciation so imperative on its fuller exposition 
should have been so uniformly and so long thus rejected allow 
ing that the original judgment of aristotle was given rashly 
upon but a partial consideration of the subject we still cannot 
at all understand how his followers should not on the one hand 
having undertaken its examination have discovered its fallacy 



 appendix 

or on the other having adopted and undertaken to defend it 
have offered something better — something at least not absurd — 
in its vindication it is however but another instance per 
haps the most illustrious of all of what has been often noticed 
of how completely the weight of authority often prevails against 
the clearest evidence as in physical science the older philoso 
phers refused to believe the evidence of their senses against the 
recorded judgment of aristotle so in mental science they re 
fused to accept the equally obvious evidence of their understand 
ings where it testified against the same infallible authority 

the only explanation which can be offered of this strange 
oversight and it is probably the true one is that the logi 
cians for the most part after aristotle limited their attention 
to the single case of universal quantification this considered 
in relation to the rules which were already laid down for predi 
cation according to which the predicate notion was always of 
greater extent than the subject notion would not only naturally 
but necessarily lead to the rejection of such onesided quantifi 
cation 

some exceptions do however as we have said occur in which 
the subject is looked at in a wider aspect and to these it is time 
that we should more explicitly refer 

 some exceptions to the common doctrine in which the prin 
ciple of a quantified predicate receives a more enlightened considera 
tion and is partially either in principle or practice formally alloived 

laurentius valla was so far as i know the first by whom 
the express quantification of the predicate was in any form or 
to any extent allowed and if indeed the force of the tradi 
tion against it was ever to be broken through this was a service 
which we might naturally have expected to receive at his hands 
since he was assuredly one of the most independent and active 
thinkers not alone of his own but also of any age the same 



appendix 

orijinality of wliich his life and writings were the constant ex 
pression characterises also his logical inquiries he complained 
of the diffuseness and defects of the existing logic undertook a 
thorough examination of its doctrines and accepted none but such 
as appeared founded on the truth of things whatever there 
fore rested simply on authority he at once threw aside while 
whatever appeared to have scientific evidence in its favour he 
with equal readiness adopted as the result of this thorough 
independence he was doubtless sometimes led into error from 
which an adherence to authority would have preserved him but 
he was often also led into truth to which the force of authority 
would as certainly have denied his access so that on the whole 
he certainly introduced more truth than error into the science 
and had he been less hasty and capricious the result of his 
labours would probably have been still more valuable as it 
is however his treatise has all the freshness and vigour of in 
dependent thought and with no loss of accuracy possesses the 
rare merit of being a really interesting introduction to a science 
not proverbial for the attractiveness of its elementary works 

valla flourished during the first half of the fifteenth century 
having been born at rome in and dying in his 
logical work de dialectica dates therefore from the middle of 
that century i cannot find however any account of a printed 
edition of it before the one published at venice in the year 
 though in all probability it must have been printed much 
earlier from the title of this earlier edition de dialectica 
contra aristoteleos it would seem at first to have been avow 
edly published against the logicians of the day as it is quite 
certain from his short defence of himself at the close of the 
work that valla did not escape severe censure and indeed per 
secution the boldness of his criticisms on the current doc 
trines indeed though these were coupled for the most part 
with the most respectful references to aristotle himself 
when taken in connexion with the enmity aroused by his 



 appendix 

stubborn adherence to the truths which he had obtained by 
his own industry and his contemptuous rejection of those which 
were merely traditional — his criticisms we say taken in con 
nexion with the enmity avhich his conduct in these respects had 
excited were likely enough to provoke active and fierce opposi 
tion his attack or what seemed an attack upon the time 
honoured and sacred fortress of the aristotelic logic would 
naturally be the signal for a general assault on the part of his 
enemies there are none however but must be struck with 
the calm beauty and dignity of his protest against the meanness 
and the malice of the persecutions to which he had been sub 
jected for his defence of what he held to be the truth and 
none too however wayward haughty and petulant that de 
fence may sometimes have been who will not heartily respond 
to the noble sentiment wdth which he closes — verum im 
perator noster deus railites suos ex acie fugere non vult sed 
aut vincere aut strenue fortiterque pugnantes mortem oppetere 
non enim ipsis pereuntibus veritatis gloria perit sed vivit sed 
vincit sed illo piissimo cruore sancitur atque consecratur 
for myself i feel that i could freely forgive the errors of his 
life had they been far more serious than they were when i 
find him consciously upheld by such high inspiration and see 
that amidst all its pride and storm he cherished so sincere a love 
for the truth and so stern a determination to defend it against 
all odds and at every hazard 

some apology we feel is due for having dwelt so long upon 
the man when it is in strictness of speech with his doctrine 
that we are here alone concerned we trust that this may be 
found in the fact that he is at once the least known and the 
best worth knowing of all logical writers to return however 
to his work — the only edition of this with which i am acquainted 
is that printed at paris in the year to and it is from 
this accordingly that i uniformly quote this edition has not 
the title given above but simply the following — larirentii 



appendix 

vallce romani de dialectica libri iii in this work as we have 
said valla allows the express quantification of the predicate in 
theorj and to a certain but very limited extent adopts it in prac 
tice before however referring to the passages which contain 
the evidence of this it may be worth while to look for a moment 
at what he says of conversion this is very curious and acute 
and though it does not explicitly bring out his doctrine of the pre 
dicate will yet very well serve as introductory thereto in his 
chapter de convertenda enunciatione he says as follows —

this subject which may be found in valla i give only the passages which

valla has here manifestly penetrated into the true nature of 
conversion his doctrine in effect is that by explicating the 
proposition the conversion is in any case a simple turning of 
the sentence thus for example when we say all man is 
animal what do we mean obviously that all man is some 
animal or a species of animal or a certain species of animal 
therefore a certain species of animal is all man in other 
words that though the predicate notion is in general absolutely 
considered of wider extent than the subject notion yet that 
when considered relatively in a proposition its extent is always 
restricted to that of the notion with which it is connected so 
that by expressing this restriction that is by explicating the 
proposition the subject and predicate are always convertible 
terms and thus all conversion is necessarily simple he accom 
plishes this it will be seen by explicitly quantifying the predi 
cate as no man is a satyr — that is any satyr he has how 
ever blundered in the example he should have given ullus 
for nullus or est for non est 



appendix 

we pass on however to his more explicit judgment in this 
matter in the third book of his treatise valla considers the 
right of the predicate to the marks of quantification in a brief 
chapter devoted expressly to this subject it is headed dum 
signum applicatur prcedicato dumque abest a toto syllogismo signum 
and is as follows — hactenus locuti sum us cum signum uni 
versale applicatur suhjecto quid cum applicaturroe jcato certe 
pari ratione quae exerapla breviter subnectam tu amas omnes 
tuos cives hi autem omnes sunt cives tui ergo tu amas hos 
omnes hoc universaliter particulariter vero si assumas hie 
est civis tuus concludasque ergo tu amas hunc sive diverse 
exemplo deus est ubique id est in omni loco tartarus est 
locus ergo deus est in tartaro hoc affirmative negative sic 
 tu nullum civem tuum sive nuuos cives tuos amas hi omnes 
sunt cives tui ergo neminem vel nullum horum amas item in 
nuuo loco scelerato est deus tartarus talis est ergo non est in 
eo deus exempla quae attuli per signa universalia si touamus 
signa eandem vim habebunt redacta ad infinita ut superiore 
libro probavi ut deus non est in loco scelerato sive in locis 
sceleratis subauditur enim ullo sive ullis tu non amas cives 
tuos suhintelligitur omnes idem fit in superioribus exemplis 
ac caeteris omnibus — cap xlvii fol 

here the quantification of the predicate is explicitly allowed 
and though the examples given of its lawfulness be incorrect the 
rules of the common doctrine are falsified for these examples 
are affirmative syllogisms of the second figure contrary to the law 
that all valid reasonings in that figure must be negative it is 
also further shown in this chapter that the quantity of the pre 
dicate is invariably a determinate one and that when not so ex 
pressed it is nevertheless always understood 

valla here accordingly allows the quantification in theory 
elsewhere he follows it in practice besides the examples given 
above i remember two other passages in which he does this 

the first is when speaking of subcontraries he employs the 



 appendix 

express quantification to prove that these cannot both be false 
the passage is as follows — 
j quocirca propria et pene sola subcontrarietas est in pro 
nominibus ac propriis nominibus nunquam ut dixi utraque 
parte vera quo magis illorum confutatur opinio quibus pla 
cuit duas aliquando subcontrarias simul esse falsas vhi eorum 
prcedicatis adest signum universale ut plato est omne animal 
 plato est nullum animal neque enim sunt verse subcontrarias 
quarum secunda non negat quod prior affirmat habet itaque ilia 
affirmativa plato est omne animal suam negativam plato 
non est omne animal et hsec negativa suam affirmativam plato 
est aliquod ammal quia ullum dicere non possumus — cap xxxv 
fol the whole passage is longer and the quantified predi 
cate is used in illustration of the same point to the end of the 
chapter but the above extract may suffice to illustrate this use 
the second passage is contained in a brief but important 
chapter headed syllogismi per totum et partem the two last 
sentences contain the specific examples but the whole chapter 
is well worth quoting and the more so since in some of the 
earlier examples also the predicate is quantified it is as fol 
lows — 

 similis ratio in toto et parte quae in genere et specie quas 

 valla seems somewhat strangely to employ the terms whole and part 
exclusively in relation to physical wholes and parts in this chapter accord 
ingly under the general head of whole and part he confines his attention 
entirely to these without making any reference to the wholes and parts 
which had been commonly discriminated as logical and metaphysical to 
the logical or extensive whole indeed no express reference was necessary 
since all ordinary syllogistic reasonings his own amongst the rest pro 
ceeded in this quantity it being the only one formally recognised in the 
science to the metaphysical whole he himself refers elsewhere in a 
previous chapter devoted to the consideration of the order of the syllogistic 
parts he gives an example of a reasoning in the metaphysical or compre 
hensive whole and very sagaciously asks why the syllogism does not pro 
ceed in this order from the individual or species to the genus — from the 
narrower to the wider notion what is the reason says he that we 
may not construct a syllogism thus — socrates is man but all man is

 item negative nihil corporis anima negligit toti ungues 
sunt aliquid vel pars corporis sive hie unguis est aliquid vel 
pars qucedam corporis ergo nihil unguium aut non hunc unguem 
anima negligit — cap xlix fol 

it will be seen that in these last examples the rules of the 
common doctrine are again falsified for they contain syllogisms 
of the second figure some of which are affirmative and others 
particular the examples may indeed be objected to 

such is the doctrine of laurentius valla on the point in ques 
tion and it will be seen from the extracts we have given that 
he recognises though appreciating very partially and imper 
fectly its significance the express quantification of the predicate 

animal therefore socrates is animal ascending as it were by certain 
steps socrates the individual man the species animal the genus this 
vras in effect asking though he himself probably did not see the full mean 
ing of his own question why the syllogism in logic did not proceed in the 
whole of comprehension as well as in that of extension a wise question which 
was not replied to by subsequent logicians and remains still unanswered 



 appendix 

the two next witnesses whose evidence t have to quote in 
favour of a quantified predicate have this much in common — 
that they were contemporaries — were both men of great learn 
ing and ability — both acute writers on logic — both well and 
widely known in their own day and that their names and works 
have long since passed into utter forgetfulness it may i be 
lieve be added that i am the first in modern times to have 
directed any attention to their writings — they are jodocus t 
isenach of erfurt and ambrosius leo of venice of these we 
shall take the latter first since as a fellowcountryman his 
evidence will naturally enough follow that of laurentius valla 

ambrosius leo was a physician at venice and flourished 

 ambrosius leo called fiom nola the place of his birth nolanus was 
one of that noble band of men distinguished for varied genius and scholar 
ship whose labours towards the close of the fifteenth and commencement 
of the sixteenth centuries conferred on venice a name of imperishable re 
nown he was as stated in the text for many years a physician in that 
city but like several of his craft at that time was not only skilled in medi 
cine as a physician but also profound as a philosopher erudite as a scholar 
and accomplished in all worthy and noble arts as a gentleman his very 
name however seems to have been long since forgotten and his works to 
have passed into complete oblivion for a time indeed these seem to have 
been kept in some remembrance since they appear in some of the older 
catalogues of distinguished works and authors thus simler in his epitome 
of the bibliotheca of conrad gesner says ambrosius leo nolanus scripsit 
opus quaestionum turn aliis plerisque in rebus cognoscendis tum maxime 
in philosophia et medicinae scientia impressum venetiis idem edi 
dit castigationes in averroem qui liber magnus est ac totius philosophiae 
thesaurus sunt enim quasi commentarii quidam ordine in singulos aris 
totelis libros excusae venetiis actuarii johannis zachariae fihi de 
urinis libros septem ex graecis latinos fecit impressi basileae apud cra 
tandrum — epitome bibliothecce conradi gesneri per josiam isim 
lerum tiguri 

and vossius adds to this comment the following — anno ac 
deinceps non exiguae eruditionis laudem reportavit ambrosius leo no 
lanus vir latine graecequ doctissimus philosophus idem ac medicus in 
signis hie prabter ea quae a simlero memorantur reliquit libros tres de 
nola non incuriosfe perscriptos quorum saepius meminit leander albertus 
in descriptione italiae imprimis quo loco agit de nola— de hist lat 
l iii c xii 

he appears to have soon lost even such distinction as this for his name 



appendix 

during the latter part of the fifteenth and the beginning of 
the sixteenth century he was the author of several smaller 
treatises but his greatest production is a work against averroes 

does not appear in any of the later catalogues of a similar kind which i 
have been able to examine indeed for some time after having obtained 
his work against averroes i could not find out who or what he was at 
length however i discovered that he was a friend of erasmus the latter 
having become known to leo during his stay in venice and having after 
wards corresponded with him in the epistles of erasmus accordingly 
there are a few scattered references to ambrosius leo and to this source 
i am mainly indebted for the few particulars of his history with which i 
am acquainted 

the first mention of leo which we meet with in the epistles is in a letter 
written to erasmus by john watson and dated from cambridge in the 
month of august speaking of a recent visit to venice watson says 
 i conversed almost daily with the physician ambrosius leo in the apo 
thecarys shop at the sign of the coral i remembered him from what you 
had said of him in connexion with the proverb tis a vcttrut he did 
many things for me for your sake the reference here is to the adagia 
of erasmus who in his commentary on the proverb quoted above refers to 
ambrosius leo in the following manner — etenim cum hsec meis illinirem 
commentariis forte fortuna supervenit ambrosius leo nolanus philoso 
phus hujus tempestatis eximius et in pervestigandis disciplinarum mys 
teriis incredibili quadam diligentia solertiaque praeditus neque vero medio 
criter exercitatus evolvendis et excutiendis utriusque linguae scriptoribus 
— adagia erasmi in h 

in the summer of the year leo himself writes to erasmus and after 
referring to a small work which he had written on the history of his native 
town and district nola and to other labours in which he had been engaged 
tells him that he has completed a great work divided into fortysix books 
peripatetic in doctrine and written against averroes erasmus writes a long 
and very interesting letter in reply almost a twelvemonth afterwards in 
which he calls to remembrance the pleasant intercourse he had had with 
leo and his brother scholars at venice and congratulates him upon the 
happy fortune which had cast his lot among the most learned scholars 
and in the first city of the world — quo minus expectatae venerunt tuae 
liter ae ambrosi doctissime hoc mihi plus voluptatis attulerunt sic enim 
mihi totam illam nostras consuetudinis memoriam renovarunt ut eas legens 
apud venetos mihi viderer agere veteres amicos meos tueri coram et am 
plecti aldum baptistam egnatium hieronymum aleandrum m musu 
rum te cum primis amicorum omnium suavissimum agnosco lepidissimos 
tuos mores in epistola tua quae tota jocis ac salibus scatet te felicem 
cui contigerit in pulcherrimis studiis et in urbe facile omnium magnificen 
tissima inter patricios et eruditos viros consenescere 



 appelsdix 

entitled ambrosii nolani castigationes adversus averroem 
this was first published at venice in the year and again 
at the same place in the first part of the work is occu 

he afterwards expresses his earnest wish that the book against averroes 
were published 

we hear no more of leo in the epistles till the year in which year 
he seems to have died for in the month of october in that year erasmus 
writing to a friend says — ambrosium nolanum nobis ac studiis ereptum 
doleo sed quandoquidem omnibus semel est moriendum ille nee vixit in 
qommode multos annos nee infehciter mortuus est — opera omnia erasmi 
ed clerici lugd vol iii pp 

the most considerable of the works of ambrosius leo both in value and 
extent is evidently this one against averroes it is a large folio volume 
containing upwards of pages and comprises within itself as simler 
says a perfect storehouse of philosophy he follows averroes pertina 
oiously into almost all subjects and seems equally at home in logical mathe 
matical physical or metaphysical discussions i speak of course only from 
a limited knowledge of the work having only consulted it in relation to 
particular subjects in which i felt specially interested but the acuteness 
and knowledge it displays seem equally balanced and both great the 
reading of leo indeed appears to have been not only very extensive but 
critical and exact he is critically read as were all the learned men of his 
time in ancient greek philosophy and what was a less common accom 
plishment seems also quite familiar with all the later greek and latin com 
mentators the wide reading and varied sagacity which it displays as well 
as the size of the work itself are quite sufficient to explain the declaration 
he playfully makes in writing to erasmus that he did not waste away his 
nights in bed 

this volume is as i have said now of the greatest rarity the biogra 
phers of averroes as far as i can find are ignorant of its existence the 
ordinary bibliographers make no reference to it it is not so far as i can 
ascertain in any of the public libraries of the country and what per 
haps is a stronger proof of its rarity than anything else and proves it to 
be as little known on the continent as in this country is the fact that a 
man so curiously and widely read as morhof should not only never 
have seen it but expresses his belief that it was never published in his 
jpolyhistor morhof while referriig to the notices in the letters of erasmus 
that such a work was in preparation says at the same time that he does 
not believe that it was ever really published 

in abatement however of the statement as to the utter obuvion into 
which the name of ambrosius leo has fallen i should say that it is still 
remembered in connexion with his small work on the history of nola which 
is not very rare and is still i see referred to in connexion with the history 
of the italian states 



appendix 

pied with a detailed criticism of the commentary of averroes 
on the organon and in this he examines among other state 
ments what averroes says on the passage in the book touching 
enunciation relative to the quantification of the predicate we 
have already given the passage from averroes leo joins issue 
with him on this statement he takes the case which is also 
taken by averroes but not referred to by aristotle — that in 
which the predicate is quantified particularly — and he defends 
against averroes the validity and usefulness of such quantifi 
cation the passage in which he does this is a somewhat long 
one but as the rarity of the work is such as to preclude any 
thing like general reference it may be worth while to give it 
entire it ought to be premised however that the text is in 
such a state partly through carelessness in printing partly 
through excessive and strange contraction that the making it 
out in many cases is a kind of divination it is as follows — 
 aliud est non recipere rem et aliud non recipere divisionem 
rei ut aliud est non recipere esse genus id quod dicimus pe 
destre et aliud non recipere divisionem pedestris in bipes et 
multipes unde aristoteles genera facillime recipit divisiones

in praedicato habent clausuram non dividuntur etiam non reci

this is on the whole the most elaborate and acute criticism 
on this passage from aristotle which i have met with and it 
quite triumphantly establishes against averroes the particular 
quantification of the predicate the way too in which aris 
totle himself is made to uphold this view is somewhat ingenious 
— that since on the one hand he does not reject it in theory 
and on the other actually adopts it in practice he must be held 
to have received and approved of the particular quantification 
of the predicate leo is very careful while rejecting the inter 



 appendix 

pretation of averroes not to oppose aristotle and i am half dis 
posed to think that he was led into the adoption and defence of 
this particular quantification as much through a determination 
to oppose averroes when this was possible without directly 
contradicting aristotle as from any previous insight into the 
question his opposition has however in this case led him 
into the partial adoption of a truth which few of the commen 
tators on aristotle have at all perceived but which he has so 
far very well stated and defended 

jodocus isenach or justus jodocus of eisenach was pro 

 justus jodocus trutvetter isenach or as he was more commonly styled 
dr jodocus isenach was one of those devoted adherents to the ancient sys 
tem of things who formed so numerous a class m germany at the begin 
ning of the sixteenth century monastic scholars they were for the most 
part who were hostile to the reformation because they discerned in it a 
reaction against scholasticism rather than because it menaced the imity of 
the catholic church in the seats of learning in germany in particular in 
deed the battle of the reformation was fought rather on the ground of 
letters than on that of religion and when a religious plea was ostensibly 
urged in defence by those in authority it was generally only as a mask under 
which they could more eflfectually attack their opponents by these men 
the true faith was identified with an ignorance of letters and a knowledge 
of scholasticism those therefore who sought to disparage the latter and 
to introduce the former were necessarily heretics and were persecuted as 
such the fierceness of this persecution indeed combined with the ob 
stinacy of those in power in clinging to a system now obsolete deter 
mined a crisis in the struggle for improvement which had long been gradu 
ally going on and hastened the complete reformation which soon followed 
they would admit no innovation whatever in the existing system of instruc 
tion they resolved not to modify in any particular their philosophical faith 
or teaching and by thus blindly refusing to give up anything lost all 
to this class as we have said isenach belonged and to this it is probably 
to be attributed that so few particulars can now be gleaned of his history 
hardly any amount of individual genius was sufficient to save a single 
one of the vanquished in that warfare from the oblivion into which all 
speedily fell to those who were interested in the revival of letters and 
the general progress of the reformation it became almost a duty to forget 
the names and reject the works of the abettors of ignorance and barbarism 
amidst the general enthusiasm which the new life had inspired few were 
sufficiently interested in those who had sought to crush it at its birth to 
redeem their names from forgetfulness or hand down any record of what 
ever virtues they possessed to posterity 



appendix 

fessor of theology and philosophy at erfurt during the latter 
part of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century 
and if the slender accounts which i have been able to obtain of 
him be correct was afterwards called to teach in the new uni 

accordingly with the exception of the very few particulars mentioned in 
the text no specific biographical account of isenach is to be obtained from 
any of the ordinary sources of information the particulars there given 
are obtained from the zedlerian lexicon which being one of the older en 
cyclopaedias devotes six lines to his memory — that being i believe the 
longest biography of isenach to be found 

i have obtained however if not some additional particulars of his his 
tory at least some materials for forming an estimate of his character from 
another source viz the letters of luther which contain some interesting 
references to him isenach may indeed be said to have been specially con 
nected with the reformation in germany since luther himself was first his 
pupil and afterwards i was about to say his murderer but i ought rather 
to say the cause of his death many grave accusations have been brought 
at different times against luther but none that i am aware of have ever 
laid this particular crime to his charge he was notorious indeed for the 
summary manner in which he dealt with his opponents but it was still 
not exactly in this literal sense that he was in the habit of destroying them 
he was known to be a mighty man — mighty in the practical power which 
force of will and fiery enthusiasm bestow — mighty in the scriptures — 
mighty for that matter in bodily strength but it was nevertheless of the 
former kind of force rather than of the latter that he was used to avail him 
self in controversy so that there would seem no just ground on which to urge 
such a serious charge it is one however to which luther himself in part 
pleads guilty how far he really was so must be judged of from the sequel 
luther was as we have said the pupil of isenach he was placed imder 
his care as it would appear by his parents in the year and con 
tinued for four years to attend his teaching at erfurt the two first of 
these were occupied with grammar rhetoric and other elementary studies 
the third was devoted to logic but he does not seem to have displayed 
any particular aptitude for the detail of that science as he certainly does 
not afterwards recall the time thus spent with any particular satisfaction 
after leaving erfurt luther seems still to have kept up some communica 
tion more or less direct with isenach in particular he seems to have 
been very urgent with him on the subject of scholasticism directly by 
personal converse and by letter and indirectly through his friends luther 
laboured earnestly and incessantly to modify his views as to the value of 
dialectic in theological training and to abate his zeal in the interest of scho 
lasticism he was often indeed carried away by the strength of his feelings 
on these subjects and what was intended as remonstrance became down 
right and stern denunciation it was hardly to be supposed that isenach

been a distinguished man since none but the best men of the 
time were called to occupy posts in that university that he 
really was so is confirmed by the manner in which he is referred 

would be prepared to listen calmly to these denunciations of his favourite 
studies he regarded them indeed with the greatest grief and indigna 
tion — feelings which deepened in proportion as luthers zeal increased 
and were aggravated by the reflection that this contemptuous rejection of 
what he held most valuable proceeded from one of his own pupils this 
was indeed that most unkindest cut of all that went far to sever the 
thread of his earthly life so that luther on hearing of his death writes 
to a friend that he fears he is responsible for having hastened that event — 
so grievously had isenach taken to heart his rash and profane condemna 
tion of the sacred writings of the schools in short that he had died of his 
luthers contempt of scholasticism — hac hora says luther writing 
to spalatin december ex socero lucas cranach pictoris audivi 
excessisse e vivis d doctorem isenacensem erfordiae timeo et me causam

doluit incredibiuter contemni dominus misereatur animae illi amen 
— luthers briefe ed de wette vol i p 

how far this was likely to have been the case will be better seen from the 
following extracts which i translate from luthers letters on account of 
their interest as illustrating the character of luther of the times and of 
isenach 

the first extract is from a letter written in february to john 
lange prior of the augustinians at erfurt inclosing a letter which he had 
written to isenach against the existing course of study it is as follows — 

 i send you this my letter to the excellent d jodocus isenach full of 
discussions against logic philosophy and theology — that is to say of blas 
phemies and maledictions against aristotle porphyry and the sententiaries 
— the accursed studies to wit of the age for so it will be interpreted by 
those who have vowed not for five years as the pythagoreans but con 
stantly and to all eternity to keep silent as the dead — to believe all things 
— to be obedient listeners — and never even in joke to venture a skirmish 
or to breathe the slightest word against aristotle and the sentences for 
what will not be believed as truths by those who have such faith in aris 
totle — who himself the most caliminious of all calumniators attributes to 
others things so absurd that an ass or a stone could not possibly hold their 
peace at them 

 see to it therefore that you carefully deliver these to that same excel 
lent man and be sure to smell out what judgment he or any of the others 
may give concerning me in this matter and let me know for i desire 
nothing more earnestly than to immask that actor who has so befooled the 



appendix ill 

to by luther who speaks of him as princeps dialecticorum 
nostra aetate isenach was the author of several works on 
various branches of philosophy his logical treatises are how 
ever two a larger and a smaller one the former was en 
church with his greek guise and to make his shame manifest to all had i 
only leisure 

 but the greatest sorrow to me is that i am compelled to see so many 
of our brother monks endowed with excellent genius for all worthy studies 
waste their lives and lose their labour amidst such filth as this nor do the 
universities cease to condemn and burn good books while at the same time 
they dictate or rather dream out bad ones 

 i wish that magister usingen and isenach to boot would abstain in 
fact contain themselves for a while from these labours my repositories 
are all filled with writings against their publications which i am con 
vinced are worse than useless and all others would think as i do were 
they not as i have said laid under an obligation of silence — pp 

the second extract is from a letter written in may to spalatin in 
which luther gives him an accoxmt after his return to wittemberg of the 
good reception which he met with from the count palatine at heidelberg 
and of his conferences with isenach and usingen he says — 

 to the erfurthians my theology is a dish of death in the pot — re 
warmed and dr isenach made himself remarkable at heidelberg by 
prefixing to all my theses a black theta a mark of reprobation accord 
ing also his written testimonial that he considered me an ignoramus in 
logic not to say divinity 

 i would have disputed likewise among them those of erfurt to wit 
on his return from heidelberg had not the litany days prevented i 
had however a private conference with doctor isenach and if i did no 
thing more made him understand that he was unable to prove his own 
positions or to confute mine nay that their opinions or perhaps sen 
tences in which case the word will refer to those of lombard were that 
beast which is said to devour itself but the fable falls on deaf ears they 
obstinately stick to their distinctions confessing howbeit that these are 
established upon no authority except what they call the dictate of natural 
reason which in our eyes who preach no other light than christ jesus — 
the true and only illumination — appears simply as a night of chaos 

 with dr usingen i strove more than with any other for he was my 
companion in the carriage to persuade him of the truth but i know not 
whether i made any way i left him in thought and wonderment so 
strong is prejudice when we have grown old in evil doctrines but the 
minds of all the young were diametrically opposed to these veterans and 

 in the old uniyersities there were certain holidays on which the prelections were iut a 
stop to and certain others on which not only the prelections but also the academical dis 
putations were intermitted the days on which the litany was used marked the latter 



j appendix 

titled summa totius logicce and was printed at erfurt in the 
year the latter which seems to be an abridgment of the 
previous work is entitled epitome seu breviarium dialecticce 
it is without any date but was probably published not more 

my hope is good that as christ passed to the gentiles when rejected of the 
jews so now his true theology which these opinionative seniors repudiate 
may be embraced by the young — pp ill 

the third extract is from another letter written in the following month 
of the same year to spalatin touching the value of dialectic in theological 
studies — 

 you ask how far i think dialectic is useful to theology verily i do 
not see how it can be other than poison to a true divine grant that it 
may perhaps be useful as a sport or exercise for youthful minds still in 
sacred letters where simple faith and divine illumination are to be awaited 
the whole matter of the syllogism is to be left below even as abraham 
when about to sacrifice left the youths with the asses and this john 
reuchlin in the second book of his cabbala sufficiently confirms for if 
any dialectic be necessary that given by nature is enough by which 
a man is led to compare one belief with another and so to arrive at the 
truth i have not unfrequently engaged in discussions with my friends 
as to the profit to be gained from this so sedulous study of philosophy and 
dialectic and truly with one consent we have marvelled at yea bewailed 
over the calamity of minds finding in these studies no help but rather a 
whole flood of hinderance 

 finally i have written to doctor isenach the prince of dialecticians 
as it seems in this age insisting most strongly on the same thing which 
indeed cannot be denied to wit that dialectic cannot help theology but 
rather hinders it because the same grammatical terms are used in a widely 
different sense ia theology and in logic how therefore i say can dia 
lectic be of any use when after i enter on theology the same term which 
in logic signified such a thing i am compelled to reject and to receive in 
another sense and that i may not multiply words take for example the 
following — body in the tree of porphyry signifies a thing made up of 
matter and form but such body cannot belong to man seeing that in the 
scriptures our body signifies matter only not also orw — as where it is 
said fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul 
farther i instance the absurd statement that an angel is neither rational 
nor irrational as also that it is of no use to the scriptures for a man to 
be called sensitive rational corporeal animated and briefly the whole of 
that arrangement of the tree of porphyry i have said and still say is more 
trivial than an old womans fancy or a sick mans dream and justly there 
fore is it called porphyrean that is bloody from the christian souls to 
wit which it has slain 

 the good man took it much to heart and affirmed that my sophisms 



appendix 

than a year or two after the former since its presswork mani 
festly identifies it with the earliest productions of the sixteenth 

could not be credited even by myself but these worthies are the bondmen 
of aristotle and porphyry and consider not vhat is said but simply vho 
says it hence it comes that they are not able to understand a single 
chapter of scripture much less to render it 

 if therefore you accept my judgment dialectic of whatever use it be 
in other things in sacred letters only does harm i myself have observed 
the doctrines and rules of the scholastic theology and have designedly en 
deavoured to treat the inspired writings and those of the fathers of the 
church according to them but may god condemn me if i lie i recoiled 
in horror from the confusion worse than that of tartarus which this treat 
ment caused but i will make the same attempt on you when we meet 
and shall then detail what you now briefly hear — pp j 

these extracts are very characteristic of luther — of his honesty — his 
thorough outspokenness — his utter want of sympathy with the ancient 
barbarism and his fiery zeal for its destruction when we remember how 
ever that such deliverances as these were addressed to a man of whose 
character and history the only remaining record is that he was a lover 
of the scholastic theology and remember also that they came with the 
bitter aggravation of having been given by one who had enjoyed the best 
opportunities of knowing the worth of the things he despised since he had 
heard theu value expounded by the ablest lips — the case certainly assumes 
a very grave aspect and one can hardly wonder that luther should have 
felt some misgivings as to his innocence in the matter on the somewhat 
extravagant hypothesis that such a catastrophe was possible to the abet 
tors of scholasticism there is here amply enough to explain a broken 
heart and certainly the mildest jury that ever was empannelled could not 
have acquitted luther of manslaughter 

the works of isenach are now altogether forgotten this smaller one 
on logic is the only one that i have ever seen my copy is quite perfect 
but contains no date printers name or place of printing nor has it catch 
words or paging of any kind its title is curious and except the pimc 
tuation is as follows — 

 epitome sen breviarium dialecticae hoc est disputatricis scientise 
iterum jam recusum planiori siquidem et praeceptorum et exemplorum 
filo 

 per doctorem judocum issennachenum 

 niitium empturienti

aliud quo sacri deo flamines supplicia fundunt sed logicae quo pueri 
prima ejus rudimenta haurire poterunt eme modo non dices olim quod 
calcearius romanus de corvo suo — opera et impensa periit 

then follow a dozen of verses by daripinus poet and orator laureate 
which occupy the rest of the titlepage 

h 



 appendix 

century this is the only work of isenachs with which i am 
acquainted but the general knowledge and acuteness which it 
displays certainly go far to vindicate the justice of the title 
which luther bestows upon him and to prove that he was not 
only an accomplished logician but what is far more rare an 
independent thinker in the science it proves clearly among 
other things that he was familiar with the use of a quantified 
predicate but what precise value he attached to it or how far 
he really employed it in the science it is extremely difficult 
from the work to determine this difficulty arises mainly from 
the circumstance that this treatise being simply designed as an 
introductory one the longer more novel and abstruse discus 
sions are left out of it and we are referred for them to the 
larger work this is the case with those which relate to the 
quantification of the predicate when we come fairly upon 
the subject and hope to have it fully discussed we are dis 
appointed in this and get instead a quiet reference to the opus 
niajus which to those who only possess the opus minus and have 
no access to the other is provoking enough quite sufficient 
however remains in this smaller work to establish the fact 

 this work though relatively less is not absolutely small it is a 
quarto volume of some thickness printed very closely in the most con 
tracted style of the most contracting era of blackletter printing in this 
ipespect it is sometimes worse even than the work of leo three letters being 
often deemed amply suflbcient for a word of three syllables and sometimes 
for one of four the text is indeed a perfect forest of large blackletter 
contractions overrun with a tangled underwood of smaller blackletter con 
tractions in the shape of notes and intersected continually with tables de 
signed to render clearer and sometimes to supersede the divisions of the text 
but which owing to the ingenious interpenetration and general confusion 
of their bracketting are in themselves a new and independent source of 
perplexity and bewilderment this being the case i will not undertake to 
§ay that i am familiar in detail with every part of the work i have looked 
through the whole read some parts carefully and marked the passages 
which seemed specially to bear upon the subject in hand it is more than 
probable however that some point of interest may have foimd its way into 
some of those labyrinths of note or table which i have not yet perfectly 
explored the extracts here given illustrate clearly enough however the 



appendix 

that he was familiar with the quantification of the predicate 
and that he employs it to some extent in the science i shall 
accordingly extract from various parts of his work some of the 
passages which go to show this these passages will neces 
sarily be given out of their own connexion and as i shall 
often be obliged to forego the comment they tempt in order 
that this note may not be unduly extended they will often be 
found to have no other relation to each other than their com 
mon reference to the principle in question i shall first give 
some extracts from isenachs exposition of terms and their signs 
then from what he says of propositions and their relations and 
finally select one or two passages from his comments on the 
special rules of syllogism 

in relation to terms he adopts the common division of cate 
gorematic and syncategorematic — the former including the sub 
ject and predicate of a proposition — the latter the various affec 
tions or modifications of these on this second division he has 
the following passage which i quote both on account of its 
own precision and for the sake of what is to follow — 

 sincathegorema quod per se et solitarie non est significa 
tivum alicujus rei vere vel imaginarie sed junctum termino sig 
nificativo et cathegorematico variat modum concipiendo rem 
significatam per ipsum quod denotat ipsum accipi pro suo 
significato vel significatis aliquo more puta universaliter par 
ticulariter singulariter et cum iis ut omnis aliquis iste non 
nam dicendo omnis nuuam rem concipio vel intelligo sed 
dicendo omnis homo concipio vel intelligo hominem non simpli 
citer sed universaliter omnem ita quoque dicendo iste nihil 
addendo vel subintelligendo nuuam rem intelligo sed quum 
dicitur iste homo intelligo singulariter hunc hominem demonstra 

point in question and are sufficient for the present purpose i have 
some hope of being able to obtain the larger work of isenach and should 
it prove of sufficient interest will hereafter give a fuller account of his 
doctrine 



 appendix 

turn idcirco dicuntur hujusmodi signa nihil significare sed

passiones 

this passage will serve to show his just appreciation of the 
value of modifying marks as affixed to terms in restricting or 
extending or in general in rendering definite their meaning 
a little further on he says very significantly in relation to 
these —

quod ipsum determinate dempto sincathegoremate sumpto ir

i give a single extract from a long chapter on signs in which 
isenach often employs propositions with their predicates quan 
tified mainly to illustrate his use of the terms determinate and 
confused at first from his casual use of these terms in other 
places i thought that by the former he meant a term with a 
mark of quantity and by the latter one without such mark 
but it appears from his exposition and illustration that he 
simply means by confused a universal subject and by determi 
nate a particular or individual subject the following is the 
passage — 

 confuse ita quod alteram extremorum denotatur ipsi con 
venire pro aliquo omnium suorum significatorum hoc vel illo 
et nullo certo vel determinato ut omnis homo habet caput 
ubi denotatur quemlibet hominem habere caput nee omnes aut 
plures unum sed quemque suum et hie dicitur supponere 
communiter confuse tamen disjunctim sive non collective 

 determinate ita quod alteram extremorum denotatur ipsi 
convenire inter omnia sua significata pro aliquo certo et deter 
minato vel aliquibus certis et determinatis ut caput habet 
omnis homo ubi denotatur esse aliquid certum et determinatum 



 appendix 

caput quod quilibet homo habeat hie dicitur supponere de 
terminate to illustrate this by an example which is given a 
little below — omnis homo non est omne animal ubi ani 
mal supponit confuse tantum anna non est omnis mulier 
ubi mulier supponit determinate 

we pass to the consideration of propositions isenachs view 
of the logical relation of a proposition is singularly just and 
his exposition of its scientific capabilities and significance is at 
once comprehensive and exact he explains in detail that the 
matter of a proposition is its terms and that its true logical sig 
nificance ever lies in the affections of these and the manner in 
which they are connected with each other he divides the affec 
tions of propositions into those which belong to them considered 
in themselves and those which arise out of their relation to each 
other the former are of course quality and quantity it is 
with the last member of this division alone that we are now 
concerned in relation to it isenach first gives the common 
doctrine with its fourfold division founded exclusively on the 
quantity of the subject he endeavours to explain the prin 
ciple of his onesided division by saying that the subject was 
selected as being the more important part of the matter of a 
proposition — quantitas propoitionis hoc modo sumpta penes 
subjectum principale vel partem principaliorem subjecti dici 
tur quantitas propositionalis et ab ea propositio simpliciter de 
nominatur aliqua denominationeexjam dictis yocatur autem 
hoc nomine propter hoc quia subjectum est prima et principalis 
pars materialis propositionis atque principale fundamentum prae 
dicationis de quo cetera enunciantur 

he then gives a statement of his own as a supplement to the 
common doctrine founded on a far wider and juster considera 
tion of terminal quantity he asserts in effect that the affec 
tion of quantity belongs to the whole matter of a proposition 
and not to one of its parts alone as hitherto exclusively con 
sidered and that whether it fall on the subject or the predi

cate it is equally of logical account his statement is as fol 
lows — 

 de quantitate terminali solet etiam nonnunquam suml 
quantitas propositionis penes quamquam partem materialem 
propositionis ie quemlihet terminum cdthegorematicum non cu 
rando quocunque loco ponatur in hunc modum —

accepttts determinate proprie est 
particularise ut hominis alter 
oculus est dexter 

acceptus confuse tantum vel de 
terminate reductive est inde 
finita ut petrus est musicus 

he then goes on to make the following somewhat curious 
statement — 

 hoc modo una propositi© potest esse universalis particu 
laris indefinita et singularis ut patet de ilia alter oculus 
est cuj usque hominis vel istius hominis dexter oculus haec 
quantitas vocatur terminalis et ab ea non denominatur propo

den©minatur simpliciter universalis sed ratione illius termini 
hominis nee denominatur simpliciter particularis sed ratione 
illius terminus oculus simpliciter ver© denominatur indefinita 
quia subjectum accipitur determinate reductive 

this he proceeds to apply t© m©dal propositions whose pe 
culiarity indeed is icgically ccnsidered in the last resort but 
an affection of the predicate 

the affections which belong to propositions considered in 



 appendix 

their relation to each other are three — opposition equipouence 
and conversion we shall extract without comment one or two 
sentences from what is said touching the first and last of these 
and then pass on to the syllogism the following passages are 
from his discussions — the one of subalternate the other of sub 
contrary opposition — 

 terminus qui in subalternante stat confuse tantum respectu 
termini distributi in subalternata non stet determinate respectu 
ejusdem termini distributi sed accipiatur confuse tantum 
 omni tempore risibile est omnis homo aliquo tempore risi 
bile est omnis homo sed subalterna prioris est aliquo tem 
pore a risibile est omnis homo posito quod ly a faciat terminum 
risibile stare confuse tantum vel ilia aliquo tempore omnis 
homo est risibilis vel ista aliquo tempore risibile est homo 

 si in una subcontrariarum ponitur aliqua universalitas in 
altera omnia debent particularisari quare hoc non sunt sub 
contrariae aliquo tempore risibile est omnis homo aliquo 
tempore nullum risibile est omnis homo sed subcontraria 
prioris est aliquo tempore risibile non est omnis homo 

the last sentence on this subject is the following which is at 
once significant and disappointing — 

 oppositio non solum sumenda est penes quantitatem pro 
positionalem sumptam penes subjectum propositionis seu prin 
cipaliorem ejus partem sed penes quantitatem terminalem quce at 
tenditur penes quamque partem materialem propositionis potest 
itaque sumi oppositio ex parte subjectorum prcedicatorum et 
determinationum tarn subject quam praedicati atque etiam 
copularum hoc est quod aliter dicitur 

the following is from his exposition of conversion — 

 quod secunda sive convertens sequatur ad conversam in 
bona cousequentia sic quod con versa non possit esse vera sine con 
vertenteret propter hoc nihil debet universalisari in convertente 
quod non fuit universalisatum in conversa nee terminus stans in

i quote the following passage mainly to show that isenach 
saw clearly what indeed he elsewhere more fully explains that 
exclusive propositions distribute the predicate it is the last 
passage in a chapter on exponibles — 

 tantum homo est animal sic probatur hoc prasdicatura 
 animal enunciatur de hoc subjecto homo et de nullo alio ah 
eo sive negatur ab omni alio et ita denotat per hoc signum 
tantum — omnis homo est animal sic probatur hoc praedi 
catum animal universaliter verificatur de hoc subjecto homo 
sive convenit subjecto pro omni supposito et ita denotatur 
per hoc signum omnis ergo c de quo alibi latius diximus 
hcec pro rudimentis puerorum sujiciant 

it will be seen that both in this passage and in the closing 
one treating of opposition reference is disappointingly made 
for fuller discussion of the matter to the other work 

isenachs discussion of the syllogism is in every respect the 
most important part of his book he gives an acute prelimi 
nary exposition touching the general rules of inference some of 
which as partially relevant to the question in hand i had 
designed to quote his discussion of figure too is curious and 
interesting especially his doctrine in relation to the fourth 
these points of interest must however give way to those which 
more immediately refer to the question of the predicate these 



appendix 

are the exceptions which he takes to the universal validity or 
necessity of the special rules of syllogism he partially falsifies 
these by quantifying the predicate as will be seen from the fol 
lowing passages — 

 ex puris affirmativis nihil sequitur formaliter 
in secunda figura 

 cujus ratio est quia contingeret medium in neutra pre 
missarum distribui aut singularisari nam prasdicatum non dis 
tribuit in affirmativis saltern de communi forma propositionum

vel sic nullus homo est omne animal

ex parte minoris extremitatis haec enim distribueretur in con 
clusione universali in qua subjicitur et non in minore affirma 
tiva in qua prsedicatur ut est cernere exemplo omnis homo 
est animal et omnis homo est substantia ergo omnis sub 
stantia est animal verum si illud cavetur quomodocunque 
firma est argumentatio ut hie omnis lucidissimus planeta lucet 
omnis lucidissimus planeta est omnis sol ergo omnis sol lucet 

 majore particular nihil sequitur formaliter et 
syllogistice in prima et secunda figuris directe con 
cludendo 

 cujus ratio est quantum ad primam figuram quia contin 
geret medium in neutra praemissarum distribui vel singularisari 
nam quum major sit particularis medium quod in ea subjicitur 
non distribuitur et quum minor non posset esse negativa ex 
superiori regula in qua medium praedicatur nee in ilia distri 
buitur de communi forma propositionum uti hoc claret exemplo 
 animal est asinus et omnis homo est animal ergo omnis 
homo est asinus omitting his application of his rule to the 
second i pass on to his refutation of it in relation to the first 
figure verum si hujusmodi inconvenientia vitantur ut puta in 
directe concludendo vel quolibet filter valebunt argumentationes 
ut lucidissimus planeta lucet et omnis sol est omnis lucidissi 
mus planeta ergo sol lucet animal currit et omnis homo 
est idem animal ergo homo currit 

it is here clearly stated that if the syllogism be taken in its 
regular form as commonly considered and as exclusively al 
lowed by logicians the rules are valid the reason of this is 



appendix 

explained by showing what logical vice would be committed if 
they were violated but it is quite truly added that if we can 
avoid committing this vice in any other way than by obeying 
the rules the syllogism is good and the rules therefore no 
longer hold this isenach shows can be done by quantifying 
the predicate he accordingly falsifies the two first rules by a 
syllogism of the following form — 

all a is au b 

all c is b therefore 

all c is a 
he partially falsifies the third rule by a syllogism in the follow 
ing form in which the predicate is not quantified in the premises 
but in the conclusion — 

all b is a 

no c is b therefore 

some a is not c or 

not any c is all a 
the fourth rule is falsified by a syllogism in the following 
form — 

all b is a 

all b is all c therefore 

all c is a 
and finally the last rule is falsitied to its first division by one 
in the following form which except that it is less definite in 
quantity is much the same as the preceding one — 

bis a 

all c is all b therefore 

cis a 
such is a brief outline of the doctrine of isenach in relation 
to the quantification of the predicate it is clear even from 
this imperfect account that he was familiar with its use and to 
some extent appreciated its value i am disposed however to 
think that he was far more familiar with its somewhat indiscri 
minate use in practice than conversant with its true scientific 



 appendix 

significance in principle his insight into this does not appear 
to be great hence he often uses it capriciously and without 
any particular end in view and though without doubt he does 
occasionally employ it to simplify the working of the science 
yet after all he does this very sparingly and by no means to 
the extent we should expect from one apparently so familiar 
with its use it is of course however as we have said some 
what difficult to determine upon such partial evidence what 
precise value he did attach to the principle since we are re 
ferred for this to discussions to which we have at present no 
access 

the last two writers whose names we have to quote in 
support of a quantified predicate are both much later than the 
preceding ones we shall briefly quote from these the pas 
sages in which they partially allow in theory or adopt in prac 
tice such quantification 

the first is an englishman joshua oldfield who in his 
curiously discursive and ingenious essay towards the improve 
ment of reason which was published in london in the year 
 touches among other subjects upon logic without pro 
fessing to give anything in the shape of a regular system he 
has some acute remarks on the syllogism and among them the 
following relative to the point in question — 

 the predicate of each enunciation is also supposed to be uni 
versally taken if denied and particularly when affirmed so that 
in this latter case it ought to have a note of universality added 
if it he universally designed as it may be in imagining a property 
and must be in giving a just definition or a right description 
for these ought to be made universal when the proposition is 
converted and such predicate put in the place of the subject 

 now when the affirmed predicate is thus universally taken 
the argument will certainly admit of being otherwise formed 
than according to the usual allowed moods or modes — p 

 now whereas it is commonly said the enunciations must be 



appendix 

so and so as in the technical words before mentioned and 
that there can be no more concluding moods in such respective 
figures it must be understood to be so upon the forementioned 
suppositions as to the quantity of the predicate for otherwise 
where this is universally affirmed there may be e g such a 
mode as itali in the first figure thus — 
i raliquod trilaterum est aequiangulum 

ta • omne triangulum est omne trilaterum 

li vergo aliquod triangulum est aequiangulum 

in english thus — 
i rsome threesided figure has equal angles 

ta every triangle is any threesided figure 

li therefore some triangle has equal angles — p 

these are the passages relative to the point in question which 
are to be found in oldfield who is the only english writer so far 
as i know by whom the quantification of the predicate is in any 
form allowed it will be seen however from these extracts 
how little he understood the principle which for the time he 
uses since he even attributes to it none but a material cogency 
and grants that the syllogisms commonly recognised by logicians 
are the only ones which are of formal and thus of universal 
validity it is also further manifest how limited was his view 
of its practical application since both in its statement and 
illustration he confines his attention exclusively to the case of 
universal quantification and this is considered only in relation 
to affirmative propositions which contain a definition or descrip 
tion 

the last instance to be adduced of the partial use of a quanti 
fied predicate is that of godfrey ploucquet he lived during 
the greater part of the last century was for many years pro 
fessor in the university of tubingen and published many small 
but acute and often original treatises in connexion with logic 
and philosophy the only work of his however with which i am 
acquainted is that entitled fundamenta philosophiae specula

of propositions to simplify their conversion the following are 
the passages in which he does this and they fully explain its 
use in his hands i quote first however in order to render 
what follows intelligible his own explanation of the peculiar 
symbols he employs —

it will be seen from these extracts that ploucquet compe 
tently understood the use of a quantified predicate in relation 
to propositions strangely enough however he makes no use 
of it in his treatment of syllogisms where especially or rather 
exclusively its higher scientific value rises into view with 
the exception of two short sentences if i remember aright for 
i speak only from past reading he gives no intimation of its 
use in relation to syllogisms these sentences are both notes 
the first which is appended as an exceptional provision to the 
rule that from two particular propositions nothing follows is 
this — hie tantum agitur de expressione conclusionis con 
sueta ubi praedicato non addi solet signum quantitativum 
the second which is given at the end of his consideration of 
the third figure and is to the effect that valid negative syllo 
gisms may be obtained in it is as follows — si in proposi 
tionibus particulariter negantibus adjiciatur praedicato signum 
particularitatis figura hsec procedit in omnibus modis supra 
recensitis 

this want of anything like a scientific application of the prin 
ciple to the syllogism may indeed be said to be universal 



appendix 

none of those to whom we have referred as having partially 
appreciated it seem to have been at all aware of its value in 
relation to the forms of reasoning but after having applied it 
to some particular detail in the treatment of propositions or at 
most to some exceptional case of syllogism appear to have 
abandoned it altogether 

the promised historical evidence touching the previous partial 
appreciations of the new doctrine properly terminates here i 
cannot however close this note without quoting a curious pas 
sage from a recent british writer whose contributions to logical 
science have not met with the attention which their merit de 
serves this writer is mr thynne who would probably have 
become better known but for the comparatively humble form 
which he has chosen as the vehicle of his logical discussions 
these discussions were published in the form of notes to walkers 
compendium of logic which has been for many years and for 
anything i know to the contrary still is the textbook of trinity 
college dublin these notes evince a careful study of logic 
and an acute comprehension of the science both in its general 
scope and in its particular detail they show also an amount 
of independent thought in relation to the science very rarely 
indeed to be met with in recent logical writings the para 
graph i am about to quote is really a very curious one on ac 
count of its strange prophetic significance it is given as a 
note to a passage in the text in which the author after giving 
the common statement that there are in all moods and that 
so many are mvalid adds accordingly there are concluding 
noods the note is as follows — 

 this as logicians say is gratuitously assumed suffi 
cient has been said by our author to establish that all other 
modes than these are inconclusive but nothing has pre 
ceded to verify the conclusions in these modes this may be 
done by the axioms even more easily perhaps than by the 



 appendix 

famous rules of aristotle but in the application of the axioms 
the distinction of the premises and extremes into major and 
minor vanishes if all men and sone animals agree with a third 
they agree with each other and it is indifferent whether it be 
understood that all men are certain animals or certain animals 
are all mankind and it is certain that if syllogistic reasoning 
had been thus viewed and followed up it would be more readily 
brought into practice or rather — as it is already in the general 
practice of reasoning thus treated imperceptibly because en 
thymematically — it would receive less distinction of mode and 
figure and consequently require less rule and admit of simpler 
and readier although not more ingenious complete or elegant 
verification than as at present treated 

this prophetic foresight however exercises no beneficial in 
fluence on mr thynnes own treatment of the science logic 
certainly receives no simplification at his hands on the con 
trary the whole subject of mood and figure is made if possible 
still more intricate by the ingenious involution and evolution of 
detail which mr thynne has introduced into its treatment 
he therefore does not accept the doctrine he foreshadows he 
may be said indeed to have explicitly rejected the quantification 
of the predicate for he has propounded a theory of his own in 
relation to quantification which is to say the least of it of the 
strangest kind mr thynne holds that quantification is an af 
fection of the copula this is a confusion so strange and com 
plete that were it advanced by a less able author it might 
be rejected at once anything however which is seriously 
urged by so careful a student of logic as mr thynne proves 
himself to be is entitled to consideration and if found to be 
erroneous merits at least the courtesy of a refutation 

mr thynne adverts to his doctrine in several of his notes 
but the passage in which he most clearly propounds it is the 
following — 

 such marks of quantity although grammatically qualifying 



appendix 

the subject do in sense qualify the copula intimating the ex 
tent in which the agreement or disagreement of the terms is 
declared — that this extent is implied to be either general or 
partial every man is an animal implies that man is uni 
versally an animal no man is a stone that man — is uni 
versally not — a stone and some men are just that man — 
is in part of the extension — just 

on this i would remark generally that even supposing it to 
be correct and that we may thus explain the quantity of the 
subject still no account is given of the quantity of the predicate 
which on the same principle ought also to be an affection of the 
copula and to be represented accordingly in the same manner 
thus to take the last of the above examples since this is the 
only one which is given in the regular form mr thynne hav 
ing in effect quantified the predicate in the others by the articles 
— this is some man is just which says mr thynne is truly 
expressed thus man — is in part of the extension — just but 
whether is this part of the extension of man equal to all just or 
some justi this is a pertinent inquiry for just is indefinite 
and must be formally limited or amplified in the same way as 
the subject on mr thynnes doctrine therefore two parts of 
extension must be expressed by the copula in some such man 
ner as the following man — is in part of its extension — just 
— in part of its extension all of this on the doctrine in ques 
tion save man and just belongs to the copula in short mr 
thynne maintains that the terms of a proposition are always 
taken absolutely and that all modification of this absolute mean 
ing belongs not to themselves but to the copula the absur 
dity of such a doctrine will be better seen from an example in 
which the modification of the terms is of a more definite numer 
ical kind than that usually found in the ordinary examples 
for as all modification of the terms that is everything indicating 
the extent of the agreement or difference existing between them 
belongs to the copula then necessarily numerical modification 



 appendix 

of extent belongs to it also take then the following proposi 
tion — ten horses are equal in strength to a hundred men 
this expounded according to mr thynnes doctrine will become 
the following — horse taken absolutely — is considered under 
the relation of ten — equal to man taken absolutely considered 
under the relation of one hundred or a part equal in extent to 
ten taken out of the whole concept horse — is equal in a given 
relation that of strength to wit to a part equal to a hundred 
taken out of the whole concept man the former way of stat 
ing it is contradictory enough and in the latter surely no one 
will seriously say that the true subject is the whole concept horse 
and the true predicate the whole concept man 

this criticism would be in part inapplicable did mr thynne 
with aristotle and some of the older logicians and indeed with 
the compendium itself on which he comments — did he hold we 
say with these that the copula is included in the predicate 
it is manifest however partly from his remarks and abundantly 
from his practice that he does not do so but with logicians in 
general considers it simply as the bond of connexion between 
two terms and in the last resort therefore always the substan 
tive verb 

mr thynne gives the following illustration in confirmation 
of his doctrine — 

 this is not the only respect in which a circumstance gram 
matically associated with the subject is logically associated with 
the copula in the proposition above no man is a stone no 
man is surely not the subject for the declaration is intended to 
be made of man and not of that which is not man nor is the 
copula zs for the relation is intended to be one of disagreement 
the negation therefore is here logically a modification of the 
copula although grammatically of the subject 

if the principle was unfortunate the illustration is certainly 
equally so in the proposition no man is a stone says 
mr thynne noman is surely not the subject for the declara 



appendix 

tion is intended to be made of man and not of that which is not 
man now what is the declaration made in the above propo 
sition it must surely be is a stone which says mr thynne 
is intended to be made of man and not of that which is not man 
but which i cannot but think notwithstanding is intended to be 
made of that which is not man since it cannot be truly said that 
any stone is a man and accordingly that noman is the subject 
speaking generally it may be said that in any negative propo 
sition the negation may fall on the subject on the predicate or 
on the copula but that on whatever member it falls it becomes 
truly a part of that member falling on the subject therefore in 
the proposition above noman is the true subject 

let us look however for a moment more closely into the 
matter a proposition is but the reflex in language of a judg 
ment a judgment is the product of a particular mental act 
now the whole question is determined by ascertaining specifi 
cally ivhat that act is it is in brief one of comparison two 
things terms of any kind are compared together in order to 
ascertain whether they stand to each other in the relation of de 
termining and determined of whole and part in a word to 
discover what is the extent of their agreement or difierence 
now does this extent of agreement or difference belong to the 
objects which are compared together or to the mind which com 
pares them surely when two things are compared together 
and found to stand to each other in the relation of part and 
whole that affection of quantity belongs to the things and not 
simply to the mind which perceives them but on the theory 
in question the act of judgment is not only cognitive hut creative 
it not only perceives a relation but also creates the relation which 
it perceives this involves a double confusion a confusion in 
philosophy of the perceiving mind with the things perceived of 
the mental act with its object a confusion in logic of quantity 
with quality of the matter with the form of a proposition of 
things to be connected with the bond of their connexion it is 



 appendix 

indeed an error so manifest that we need not dwell upon its re 
futation and one which could only have been committed by so 
able a logician as mr thynne through great haste or greater 
oversight 

we have thus the subject of quantification viewed in almost 
all the aspects in which it can possibly be considered the 
common doctrine considers it in relation to the subject sir wil 
liam hamilton as it aifects the predicate mr thynne maintains 
that it is an affection of the copula while mr de morgan 
after lambert has elaborated a particular quantification of the 
middle term this last scheme however as but a trivial and prac 
tically useless refinement on a doctrine universally held by logi 
cians may be thrown out of account mr thynnes notion we 
have endeavoured to show must as the result of a strange 
confusion be at once rejected the subject and predicate 
therefore alone remain to be considered the quantification of 
these terms as the ultimate constituents of logical analysis is 
we need scarcely say allimportant through the working out 
of quantification in relation to the subject the existing logic has 
attained to whatever of perfection of detail it can pretend to 
through its working out in relation to the predicate it will at 
tain to the whole perfection of which as a science it is suscep 
tible the former is substantially the work of aristotle the 
latter is equally so that of sir william hamilton 

to sum up then the evidence we have gained we have 
found on the one hand that the express quantification of the 
predicate has been rejected with singular uniformity throughout 
the entire history of the science on the other hand that it has 
been sometimes partially adopted in theory and at other times in 
various ways applied in practice only however to amend some 
particular detail of the science — it may be to simplify the process 
of conversion — it may be to modify by a problematical excep 
tion some particular rule of syllogism but we have also seen 
that its want has never been signalised as a fundamental de

feet in the original logical analysis — a defect through which 
the science had been encumbered by unscientific supports — dis 
figured by unscientific additions — dwarfed by unscientific re 
strictions and thus shorn of its true beauty of proportion and 
completeness that it has never therefore been employed as a 
principle to reconstruct the whole edifice of the science and by 
removing what was useless rejecting what was false and sup 
plying what was wanting to restore it to its perfect and har 
monious beauty 

despite therefore the evidence of partial perception which 
we have adduced the original statement that the principle in 
its full scientific significance has been altogether overlooked by 
logicians is vindicated 




no ii 



on the catholic doctrine touching the implicit 
quantification of the predicate 



though logicians have with one consent rejected the eoqlicit 
they have nevertheless always held an implicit quantification 
of the predicate this was indeed absolutely necessary to the 
existence and working of the science for since all reasoning 
is in the last resort but the comparison of two terms with a third 
term — but the perception of how far two terms mutually agree 
or disagree through the perception of how far they agree or dis 
agree with a third — it is obviously not only important but im 
perative that the extent of these terms themselves should be 
taken into account this is indeed the very essence of the 
reasoning apart from this there can be no measurement of 
extent and no conclusion of identity or difference of extent ad 
the result of such measurement •ia

 appendix 

in other words in any syllogism the process of the reasoning 
and the evidence of its validity is the same and it is the follow 
ing — the middle term is the mean or measure in the first place 
one extreme is compared with the middle term and seen to agree 
with it so far then the other extreme is compared with the middle 
and also seen to agree with it so far and thereupon this iden 
tity of agreement is affirmed but in either case if i do not 
know the extent of the term compared cannot take it that is 
in some definite extent i cannot tell how far it agrees with the 
middle or again if i do not know the extent of the middle 
term cannot take it in some definite extent i cannot tell 
whether the term to be compared agrees with it in extent or 
not — whether it is part or whole or none the predicate no 
tion however in every reasoning is one of these terms and 
stands in one of these relations it is therefore absolutely 
necessary as we have said to the validity of the reasoning that 
it should have a definite quantity and a definite quantity accord 
ingly it always has had in the science this quantity how 
ever instead of being left like that of the subject to reflect 
itself in language according to the whole extent of its possible 
variation as an element of formal thought was made the sub 
ject of arbitrary legislation logical law enacted that the quan 
tity of the predicate should always be held particular in affirma 
tive propositions and universal in negative ones that logicians 
by this arbitrary and unjust enactment crippled their science — 
crippled it too in a useless and preposterous manner — could be 
very easily shown the natural scientific action of one of its 
parts was at once interfered with it could only work now under 
given artificial restrictions — restrictions which had not the 
slightest shadow of scientific warrant for their imposition 
these restrictions are indeed not only artificial but capricious 
for no reason whatever can be shown why one term of a rela 
tion of quantity should be made the subject of arbitrary legis 
lation rather than another it would have been just as wise 



appendix 

and just as scientific to have laid down arbitrary rules for the 
quantity of the subject as for that of the predicate why not 
it may be asked of the logicians place the subject under the 
same restrictions and enact for instance that its quantity shall 
always be held universal in affirmative propositions and parti 
cular in negative ones 

the whole subject may be illustrated more fully in detail by 
the use of a figure which we have already partially employed 
the subject and the predicate may be said to be the legs on 
which the syllogism stands its free progress of course de 
pends on the natural unrestricted action of these members 
logicians have however crippled one of these — the predicate 
— by preventing such natural action in order however that 
the syllogism might work at all after having been thus maimed 
it became necessary to provide some support for the crippled 
limb this accordingly was found and in the shape of a body 
of special rules a crutch which partially supplied the place of 
the natural support was realised why did not the logicians 
we ask since they had thus endorsed the principle of such a 
procedure destroy the natural action of the other limb also 
and provide it with the same artificial support they would 
thus have solved the problem how far the syllogism could pro 
ceed when altogether deprived of the native strength of its own 
members and supported on two crutches instead of one — an in 
genious experiment enough certainly but one which bears 
exactly the same relation to the natural development of the 
science that racing in sacks does to the natural exercise of the 
limbs in walking 

this ingenious problem however the logicians have not at 
tempted in its integrity they have remained satisfied with its 
partial solution in relation to the predicate the laws which 
they have laid down for the regulation of its quantity are as 
we have said two viz — 



 appendix 

° that in all affirmative propositions the quantity of the 
predicate is particular 

° that in all negative propositions the quantity of the pre 
dicate is universal 

on these two axioms as they are commonly but of course 
erroneously termed the whole detail of the existing logic rests 
they have determined its peculiar form and necessitated its 
special rules these special rules may indeed be appropriately 
described as a body of provisions to secure that the predicate is 
always really taken according to the quantity assigned to it in 
the axioms this will be at once manifest by an examination 
of the demonstrations of those special rules which are sometimes 
given in logical works these demonstrations contain of course 
the reasons on which the rules rest and these will be found in 
every case to arise from the necessities of the predicate in rela 
tion to its implied quantity we quote the following in illus 
tration from the port royal logic where all the special rules 
are briefly but adequately explained 

 rules of the first figure 

 the minor must be affirmative 

 for if it were negative the major would be affirmative by 
the third general rule and the conclusion negative by the fifth 
therefore the greater term would be taken universally in the con 
clusion since it would be negative and particularli in the major 
for it is its attribute in this figure and would be affirmative thus 
violating the second rule which forbids us to conclude from the 
particular to the general this reason holds also in the third 
figure where the greater term is also attribute in the major 

 ihe major must be universal 

 for the minor being affirmative by the preceding rule the 
middle term luhich is its attribute is taken particularly therefore 
it must be universal in the major where it is subject which 
renders this proposition universal otherwise it will be taken 



appendix 

twice particularly contrary to the first general rule — pp 
 

 first rule of the second figure 

 one of the two propositions mmt he negative and consequently 
the conclusion also hy the sixth general rule 

 for if both propositions were affirmative the middle which 
is here always attribute would he taken twice particularly contrary 
to the first general rule — p 

the necessity of these special rules is manifest for of those of 
the first figure if the former were violated a term which as 
the predicate of an affirmative proposition was particular in the 
major premise would as the predicate of a negative proposition 
become universal in the conclusion if the latter were violated 
the middle term would as predicate in the affirmative minor 
premise be particular there as well as in the major and thus 
remain undistributed the same reason holds in the first rule of 
the second figure the other special rules are susceptible of a 
similar explanation as may be readily tested by taking them 
and the two axioms of quantity and working out the relation 
of determination which exists between them these axioms 
are thus as we have said operative through the whole detail 
of formal reasoning as it stands in the existing logic re 
jecting the explicit and accepting only the implicit quantification 
of the predicate the question to be determined by logicians was 
— how many of the possible forms of reasoning are valid with 
out such explicit quantification the commonly accredited 
syllogisms were the result of this examination the special 
rules which protect them were generalisations from the causes 
which rendered the rest invalid those which severally accord 
ing to their figure obeyed the conditions of these rules were 
alone accepted these reasonings were declared moreover not 
only to embrace all the valid syllogisms which could be obtained 
under such restrictions but also to exhaust all the possible forms 



 appendix 

allowed by the laws of thought this is indeed one of the 
grounds expressly taken by pacius in his rejection of a quan 
tified predicate he says at the close of the second of the ex 
tracts given from him earlier in the appendix that the quan 
tification of the predicate is of no use to the syllogism — that it 
does not at all aid its validity and gives a syllogism in barbara 
of the first figure in illustration of his statement the answer 
to this is easy the express quantification of the predicate will 
not of course help the validity of those syllogisms which have 
been expressly constructed so as to be independent of its aid and 
the cogency of which therefore is complete without such quan 
tification all the syllogisms of the existing logic are of this 
kind and their validity accordingly is independent of any such 
expressed quantity but this does not at all prove on the one 
hand that even these would not possess a higher formal com 
pleteness with the quantity of the predicate expressed or on 
the other hand that there may not be other syllogisms whose 
validity entirely depends on such expressed quantity this is 
indeed the case for on the one hand everything of force in a 
formal science ought to be formally expressed and on the 
other there are a number of forms of reasoning guaranteed by 
the laws of thought whose validity is not only contributed to 
but constituted hy the expressed quantity of the predicate 
looked at therefore from the lower ground of the axioms of 
quantity and the reasonings possible through them the ex 
pressed quantity of the predicate is not absolutely necessary 
but regarded from the higher ground of the laws of thought 
and their scientific development this quantification is not only 
imperative but indispensable 

these socalled axioms of quantity it may be worth while to 
notice are but corollaries from the laws laid down touching 
regular predication for if the only lawful predication is that in 
which a genus is predicated of its species since the genus is al 
ways of wider extent than its species when so predicated it can

only be taken in some part of its whole extent that is say par 
ticularly again if it be unlawful to affix marks of quantity to 
the predicate we cannot deny some part of a genus of one of its 
species and all negative propositions must therefore contain 
repugnant species or genera which will accordingly be denied 
of eacu other in their ivhole extent the rules for predication 
and those for the quantity of the predicate thus at bottom im 
ply each other it would perhaps be difficult to say which were 
cause and which effect or rather it would probably be nearer 
the truth to say that they are both the result of the same defec 
tive analysis and want of scientific insight out of this original 
defect have arisen as we have shown the complexity the re 
striction and the disorder of which the special rules and the 
syllogisms they indorse are at once the evidence and the result 
the simplicity of the reasoning process contrasted with the 
complexity of the rules devised for its guidance and protection 
could hardly however fail to arrest the attention of some of 
the many thinkers who have from time to time undertaken their 
exposition they accordingly have in various ways betrayed 
their sense of the want of thorough scientific simplicity and com 
pleteness which these rules indicated some as we have seen 
by falling upon stray syllogisms which violated the rules but 
which were nevertheless quite valid without however being 
able to offer any theoretic explanation of the fact others 
again by simplifying the syllogistic law in theory without 
being able to show how this theoretical simplification could 
be realised in actual practice a curious instance of this latter 
kind occurs in the logic of caspar wyss which was published 
at geneva where he was for some time professor in the year 
 he reduces all the rules of syllogism both the general 
and the special to the single one that every syllogism should have 
three and only three terms we subjoin his reduction of the 
special rules as a specimen of the way in which he accom 
plishes this —

all that is here said touching the certainty of obtaining valid 
syllogisms if we only avoid having more than three terms is 
quite true but the question arises how are we under the ex 
isting syllogistic forms to avoid having more than three terms 
the answer is more simple than satisfactory it is by observ 
ing those very precautions which the special rules enjoin — in 
other words by recalling in practice the code which bad been 
theoretically abolished the reduction of the special rules is 
so far just but not a single step is thus taken towards relieving 
the science in its practical working from the necessity which 
imposed them this could only have been done by the express 
quantification of the predicate without which indeed many of 
the syllogisms given by wyss in his reduction are formally 
worthless but of which he does not seem to have had a glimpse 



no iii 



on figure 



the opinions which have been from time to time held by 
logicians touching the nature and value of the figures that is 
to say of the second and third seem to have been very fluc 
tuating if not inconsistent and even contradictory some have 
maintained their independence as separate forms of reasoning 
others again and these are the great majority have maintain 
ed that whatever value they possess is reflected on them from 
the first figure and thus solely derived from their connexion 



 appendix 

more or less direct with it of the former some inconsequently 
retained the doctrine of reduction and thus neutralised by a 
vicious practice their purer faith a few again altogether 
rejected it while valla abolishing the third even proposes 
to reduce the moods of the first figure to those of the second 
then again with regard to the different members of the syllogism 
in these figures opinions seem to have been almost equally 
divided the great majority maintained that the syllogisms in 
these figures had a determinate major and minor premise and 
consequently a single determinate conclusion others again 
could see no grounds sufficiently decisive on which to establish 
such certainty of premise and held as apuleius and valla 
in certain cases two conclusions the former however while 
at one in their belief are by no means unanimous as to the 
grounds on which they vindicate a determinate major and minor 
premise to these figures they all agree of course that the 
major premise is that in which the major term is found all 
the difficulty lay in discovering the major term and the ways in 
which this was attempted to be done are so far as i have met 
with them of the most inconsequent and assumptive kind 

sometimes the major term was held to be the predicate of the 
question or rather the term occupying the predicate place in 
the question that to wit touching which the doubt arises 
for example if it were inquired whether man were a stone 
stone would on this doctrine be the major term sometimes 
again the major was held to be the term which was first 
enounced and often enough a major term was conveniently 
postulated through the arbitrary assumption of a major pre 
mise the methods indeed by which it has been attempted 
to vindicate determinate members to the syllogisms of these 
figures all resolve themselves in the last resort to a beg 
ging of the question this was generally done in one of two 
ways either a determinate conclusion was begged in order to 
establish determinate premises or determinate premises were 



appendix 



 



begged in order to obtain a single determinate conclusion i 
had intended to have gone into this whole question at some 
length historically and for this purpose had marked a number 
of references in various logical writers but though those are 
numerous and varied in character i do not feel that i am by 
any means in possession of sufficient evidence to determine his 
torically what the catholic doctrine in relation to the above 
points really was i have accordingly thrown them aside and 
must for the present leave the statement given in the body of 
the work as it stands 

one thing however is plain that from the earliest to the 
latest times the procedure of the other figures was felt to be less 
direct and their conclusion less authoritative than those of the 
first to rectify this imperfection two processes have been 
devised the first — that of reduction — is of old date in the sci 
ence and is that usually practised by the logicians the second 
— which may be termed that of exposition — is comparatively 
new for though anticipated in some of its details it is substan 
tially kants this process is that briefly expounded and ap 
plied in the text these two processes have this much in com 
mon — that they accomplish their end by the transposition and 
conversion of propositions in the former however the change 
made in the proposition is accomplished by formal conversion 
in the latter by real inference of reduction we have already 
spoken in the essay and need not dwell upon it again here 
with regard to the process of kant it is itself as tedious and 
involved as are the reasonings which it is employed to explicate 
it is at best but a roundabout way of accomplishing what per 
haps there is no need for doing at all the new doctrine in 



 kant first expounded this speculation of his in a tract published in 
 and entitled the false subtilty of the four syllogistic figures demon 
strated die falsche spitzfindigkeit der vier syllogistischen figuren er 
wiesen this is i believe republished with kants logic in the french 
translation of that work by m tissot 



 appendix 

deed does away with the necessity or usefulness of any such 
process on that doctrine this exposition is itself expounded 
and this abolition of the figures itself abolished — figure appears 
in its true character as an unessential variation of syllogistic 
form the several figures remain in their integrity with what 
ever of special value they ever possessed while the essential 
form of the reasoning when fully stated is manifest through all 
the accidental positions of its constituent elements the same 
reasoning may be given in either of these accidental varieties of 
position but since it obviously appears as essentially one its 
cogency remains the same and reduction and exposition are 
therefore equally vain and useless

on notation 



the notation employed in the text is that of one of the 
systems devised by sir w hamilton in order to represent to the 
eye the various possible forms of reasoning by distinctive sym 
bols it has all the virtues of a perfect notation it is simple 
distinctive perspicuous and complete it can represent any 

 that it be distinctive is a virtue of first account in any system of logical 
notation for to borrow the accredited signs of any other science is on 
every account to be avoided i need scarcely say therefore how earnestly 
i unite with mr mansell in deprecating that mathematical method of ex 
position which is as he truly says in relation to logic alike injurious 
to the science and repulsive to the learner 

the introduction of mathematical symbols and methods of working into 
logic is indeed on every account to be protested against by all who are in 
terested in the welfare of the science the rejection of these is the more 
to be insisted on as wellmeaning efiorts still continue to be made to im 
prove logic by mathematical treatment if not indeed to afford it mathe

relation of the terms any order of the propositions any extent 
of quantity the letters represent the terms the points their 
quantity and the lines with the letters the propositions the 
letters express by position to the eye the relation which the 
terms have in thought the middle being placed between the ex 
tremes the meaning of the points has been already explained 
the colon denotes universal quantity all the comma particu 
lar quantity some of the lines the shorter denote the pre 
mises the longer the conclusion the thick end denotes the 
subject the thin end the predicate thus the first syllogism given 
in the table would read as follows — 

all b is all a 

all c is all b therefore 

all c is all a 
negative propositions are marked by crossing the copulative 
line on which the negation falls as shown in the premises of the 
negative syllogisms given in the table i may here notice that 
the cross is absent from the lines of conclusion in these syllo 
gisms by accident and not by design it was omitted in the 
cutting of the type and i must request the reader to be good 
enough to supply it by the pen 

this system of notation will now probably be generally known 
to logical students through the exposition of it given by mr 



matical protection with all such help however it can well afford to dis 
pense if it could not — indeed if this were not to it hindrance rather than 
help — it would have no claim to rank as a separate science the notion of 
extending the sphere of mathematics so as to include logic is as theoreti 
cally absurd as its realisation is practically impossible to identify logic 
with mathematics is to make the whole equal to its part while to subor 
dinate the former to the latter is to increase the marvel by making the 
whole less than its part and those who without attempting this display 
their skill by translating logical forms into mathematical language accom 
plish a work just about as useful and praiseworthy as that of the two 
zealous but thickheaded logicians — herlinus and dasypodius by name — 
who rendered the first six books of euclid into formal syllogisms all 
such endeavours possess the singular merit of making logic as repulsive as 
possible without doing the least service to mathematics 



 appendix 

thomson in his outline of the laws of thought where further 
details respecting it may be found mr thomson says in intro 
ducing his explanation that many of the different elements 
of the notation are not new with all respect for the statement 
of so careful and zealous a student of logic as mr thomson i 
must say i cannot but think that this is a mistake i do not 
know of course what authority mr thomson may have for his 
statement but with some general knowledge of most of the 
previous systems of logical notation which have been employed 
i cannot recall any which anticipate the present either in no 
tion or detail unless indeed the bare use of lines though in a 
totally different manner can be said to do so i cannot think 
however that this is what mr thomson refers to for the linear 
notation is a separate system altogether distinct from the one in 
question 

i had intended to have introduced here fuller tables running 
the positive and negative syllogisms through all the figures as 
well as some specimens of other systems of notation which sir 
william hamilton has kindly placed at my disposal i am not 
without hope however that sir william will himself publish 
them in full before very long and i need scarcely say there 
fore how gladly i relinquish their partial introduction here i 
know how earnestly all who are interested in logical science 
will unite with me in the hope that sir william hamiltons 
health and leisure may be such as to enable him to carry 
through the press at no distant interval some portion of his 
promised work 



appendix 



note by sir william hamilton 

the following note contains a summary of my more matured 
doctrine of the syllogism in so far as it is relative to the pre 
ceding essay 

all mediate inference is one — that incorrectly called categori 
cal for the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of hypothetical 
reasoning are reducible to immediate inferences 

mentally one the categorical syllogism according to its 
order of enouncement is either analytic or synthetic analytic 
if what is inappropriately styled the conclusion be expressed 
first and what are inappropriately styled the premises be then 
stated as its reasons synthetic if the premises precede and 
as it were eifectuate the conclusion these general forms of 
the syllogism can with ease be distinguished by a competent 
notation and every special variety in the one has its corre 
sponding variety in the other 

taking the syllogism under the latter form which though 
perhaps less natural has been alone cultivated by logicians and 
to which therefore exclusively all logical nomenclature is rela 
tive — the syllogism is again divided into the unjigiired and 
the figured 

the unfigured syllogism is that in which the terms compared 
do not stand to each other in the reciprocal relation of subject 
and predicate being in the same proposition either both sub 
jects or both predicates here the dependency of breadth and 
depth extension and intension extension and comprehension 
c does not subsist and the order accordingly of the pre 
mises is wholly arbitrary this form has been overlooked by 
the logicians though equally worthy of development as iny 

l 



 appendix 

other in fact it affords a key to the whole mystery of syllo 
gism and what is curious the canon by which this syllogism 
is regulated what may be called that of logical analogy or 
proportion has for above five centuries been commonly 
stated as the one principle of reasoning whilst the form of rea 
soning itself to which it properly applies has never been gene 
ralized this canon which had been often erroneously and 
never adequately enounced in rules four three two or one is 
as follows — in as far as two notions notions proper or indivi 
duals either both agree or one agreeing the other does not with a 
common third notion in so far these notions do or do not agree 
with each other — the propositions of this syllogism in nofigure 
are marked in the scheme of pure logical notation by horizontal 
lines of uniform breadth 

in the figured syllogism the terms compared are severally 
subject and predicate consequently in reference to each other 
containing and contained in the counter wholes of intension 
and extension its canon is — what worse relation of subject and 
predicate subsists between either of two terms and a common third term 
with which one at least is positively related that relation subsists be 
tween the two terms themselves — in the scheme of pure logical 
notation a horizontal tapering line marks this relation the sub 
ject standing at the broad the predicate at the pointed end 

there are three and only three figures — the same as those 
of aristotle and in each of these we may distinguish the orders 
of breadth and of depth 

the first figure emerges when the middle term is subject 
of the one extreme and predicate of the other that is when we 
pass from the one extreme to the other through the middle in 
the order whether of extension or of intension in the nota 
tion of this figure we may of course arbitrarily make either of 
these orders to proceed from left to right or from right to left 
that is two arrangements are competent — there is here deter 
minately one direct and one indirect conclusion 




appendix 



the second figure arises when the middle term is the predi 
cate of both extremes the order of breadth proceeding from 
middle to extremes the order of depth from extremes to middle 

the third figure is determined when the middle term is the 
subject of both extremes the order of extension proceeding 
from extremes to middle the order of intension from middle to 
extremes 

in the second and third figures there is thus only one ar 
rangement possible in logical notation and as extension and 
intension are here in equilibrium there is no definite major and 
minor premise and consequently no indirect but two indifferent 
conclusions — this is best marked by two crossing lines under 
the premises each marking the extreme standing to the other 
as subject or as predicate 

of course each figure has its own canon but these it is not 
here requisite to state the first figure besides its more 
general canon has also two more special — one for syllogisms 
in the order of extension and one for syllogisms in the order 
of intension and what is remarkable aristotles dictum de 
omni c in the prior analytics gives that for extension 
whilst his rule — prcedicatum prcedicati c in the categories 
affords that for intension although this last order of syllogism 
was not developed by him or the logicians — both inadequately 

in regard to the notation of quality and quantity in the syllo 
gisms unfigured and figured — negation is marked by a per 
pendicular line which may be applied to the copula to the 
term or to the quantification — as to quantity for there are 
subordinate distinctions it is sufiicient here to state that there 
is denoted — by the sign or for the quantity of one term 
ought to face the other some — by the sign all — by the sign 
 half — by the sign or more than a half the last 
two are only of use to mark the ultratotal distribution of the 
middle term of a syllogism between both the premises as af 
fording a certain inference valid but of little utility this i 



 appendix 

once thought had been first generalized by me but i have since 
found it fully stated and fairly appreciated by lambert to say 
nothing of fromraichen 

above p is a detail of ray pure logical notation as ap 
plicable to the thirtysix moods of the first figure the order 
there is not however that which i have adopted the follow 
ing is my final arrangement and within brackets is its corre 
spondence with the numbers of that given above — the moods 
are either a balanced or b unbalanced in the former class 
both terms and propositions are balanced and it contains two 
moods — i ii i ii in the latter class there are two sub 
divisions for either a the terms are unbalanced — iii iv 
xi xii or b both the terms and propositions are unbalanced 
— v vi vii viii ix x xi xii vii viii iii iv v vi ix 
x the following equation applies to my table of moods given 
in mr thomsons laws of thought — i ii xi xii vii viii 
iii iv v vi ix x — the present arrangement is also more 
minutely determined by another principle but this it is not 
here requisite to state 

if we apply the moods to any matter however abstract say 
letters there will emerge forty two syllogisms for the formal 
identity of the balanced moods will then be distinguished by a 
material difference on the contrary if we regard the mere 
formal equivalence of the moods these will be reduced to twenty 
one reasonings — seven affirmative and fourteen negative of the 
balanced moods i and ii are converted each into itself of the 
unbalanced every odd and the even number immediately fol 
lowing are convertible and in negatives the first and second 
moods a b of the corresponding syzygy or jugation is reduced 
from or to the second and first moods b a of its reciprocal 

there are no exceptions the canon is thorough going 
only it must be observed that the doctrine is erroneous which 
teaches that a universal negation is not a woise relation than a 
particular and that the identity of a negative with an aflnirma 



appendix 



 



five mood is regulated exclusively by the identity in quantity of 
the two syzygies or antecedents the greeks in looking to 
the conjugation of the premises alone are more accurate than 
the latins who regard all the three propositions of a syllogism 
in the determination of a mood 

it is not to be forgotten that as the correlation of the logical 
terms ought to be known only from the expression ex facie 
propositionis aut syllogisrai for all other knowledge of the re 
ciprocal dependence of notions is contingent material and ex 
tralogical and as the employment of letters following upon 
each other in alphabetical order may naturally suggest a cor 
responding subordination in the concepts which they denote i 
have adopted the signs c and f which are each the third letter 
in its respective alphabet for the extremes and the sign m for 
the middle term of the syllogism the scheme is thus eman 
cipated from all external associations and otherwise left free in 
application i also transpose the former symbols in the in 
terconvertible moods so that whereas in the one stand c m f 

in the other stand f m c

logic or the art of thinking 

being the portroyal logic 

translated from the french with an introduction 

by thomas spencer baynes 



this work possesses nearly every quality desirable in a textbook and in 
this point of view stands in remarkable contrast to the feeble superficial and 
incomplete compilations with which even our best schools of learning have 
hitherto been contented there have been two previous translations into eng 
lish but the present is the only trustworthy one we have to express our en 
tire satisfaction with the manner in which mr baynes has discharged his duty 
and to express the hope that a gentleman who can write so well as he has done 
in his introductory essay may soon appear before the public again in the char 
acter of author critic 

 with regard to this translation we need say little the ability accomplish 
ments and competence of mr baynes are a suflbcient guarantee for its ac 
curacy we have examined several parts of it and can freely affirm that the 
terseness and precision of the original are admirably preserved in the transla 
tion the manner in which the publishers have performed their part is every 
way worthy of the work itself we would therefore earnestly recommend this 
treatise to all who are desirous of acquiring habits of accurate thinking no 
modern work in english with which we are acquainted is at all so well 
adapted to secure this end — whately not excepted we trust then that 
the success of this book will be proportioned to its merits and in parting 
with mr baynes we would express our hope that he will ere long favour us 
with other similar contributions from his pen which are at present so much 
needed in this country and for which his acute philosophical powers and great 
stores of knowledge so well qualify him ediiburgh news 

 the portroyal logic though familiar to the more advanced logicians of 
this as of other countries and appreciated by them as it deserves to be has not 
hitherto met with an english translator capable of doing or who has done any 
thing like justice to the work mr baynes has a freedom and power which 
could only have been achieved by one fully conversant not only with both the 
languages he has to deal with but the subject of which the book treats while 
we instinctively feel the rendering to be faithful without necessity for reference 
to the original from its reticence of that idiomatic spirit which so pleasantly in 
troduces us to the individualities of its authors without that undue deference to 
the mere idiomatic form which might have painfully obtruded on us continually 
that they were men of another country and another era

 the translation is evidently the product of an accomplished scholar and an 
expert logician — who has done good service to the cause of mental improve 
ment by the publication of this volume appropriately dedicated to sir william 
hamilton professor of logic and metaphysics in the university of edinburgh 
to whose kind encouragement the author expresses many obligations

 we have much pleasure in commending this volume to the favourable 
notice of students and intelligent general readers and have to bear testimony

 mr baynes has performed a welcome service to the student the port

mr mcosh on the method of the divine 
government 



in the press second edition of 

the method of the diyine goyemment 

physical and moral 
by the rev james mcosh am 



 aloof from any difference of opinion and though i have as yet only read 
the work in part it appears to me worthy of the highest encomium not only 
from the excellence of the intention but for the ability with which it is exe 
cuted it is refreshing to read a work so distinguished for originality and 
soundness of thinking especially as coming from an author of our own coun 
try sir william hamilton bart 

 in the writer of this work we meet with a man of extraordinary calibre 
alike remarkable for the vigour and originality of his thinking — for the fine 
taste and freshness of his writing — for the extent of his learning and the 
breadth and minuteness of his acquaintance with those sciences which from 
the circumstance that they are prosecuted with avidity by the greater minds of 
the age impart more than the others colour and tone to the ages thinking 
mr sicoshs work is of the compact cast and thoughteliciting complexion 
which men do not willingly let die and we promise such of our readers as may 
possess themselves of it much entertainment and instruction of a high order 
and a fund of solid thought which they will not soon exhaust witness 

 to the great task which he has thus set himself mr mcosh has brought 
great powers and ample resources he is evidently a man of a profoundly plii 
losophic spirit and at the same time a man of extensive and varied culture in 
science and literature his philosophic reading seems to have been very ex 
tensive embracing not only all the better authors in theological metaphysical 
and ethical science but also the most approved writers on the various branches 
of physical speculation he combines with this a power of independent think 
ing and original speculation which enables him to move easily under the accu 
mulated mass of his learning and at the same time to apply what he has learned 
from others to purposes of his own perhaps for most readers less copious 
ness of matter and greater condensation and point in respect of argumentation

serviceable we may add that he possesses an enviable power of apt and 
striking illustration by which he is enabled both to relieve the attention and 
facilitate the comprehension of the reader in the abstruse parts of his book
