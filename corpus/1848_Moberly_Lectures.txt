preface 



it seems now to be acknowledged that the 
science of logic is to be divided into two 
branches and that in the first of these are to 
be considered the fonns of reasoning while 
the second is to make clear the method of 
their application to the various departments 
of knowledge 

the writer of this volume has endeavoured 
to compose a manual of the form of reason 
ing continually keeping in mind their sub 
sequent application in methodised and con 
nected arguments and as part of the same 
system he has followed the steps of the latin 
logicians in considering those properties of

terms which make them elements in pro 
positions and those qualities of propositions 
which make them capable of entering into 
arguments this was not the constant or 
exclusive practice of aristotle in composing 
separate works on terms or propositions he 
was naturally led to treat them in some 
manner independently and without respect 
to their character as elements of reasoning 

the subject of method has been entered 
upon in part v but only as respects the 
general characteristics of demonstrative sci 
ence and the use of probable arguments it 
is important that the method of particular 
sciences should be treated of separately and 
a work has lately appeared on this wide sub 
ject which although far from complete gives 
promise that the subject will not be neglected 
any longer 

in sketching the forms of reasoning it has 
been considered important to distinguish as 
clearly and broadly as possible the charac

logical training and its importance 

 there are three powers of the mind by in univer 
the happy employment of which the logical 

mind of one man is mainly distinguished from 
the illogical mind of another these are the 
powers of simple apprehension judgment and 
reasoning for it is plain that we should praise see pp 
a man for his logical mind if we constantly 
see him apprehending distinctly judging with 
truthfulness and reasoning conclusively 

 he must have the power of distinct simple apprehcn 
apprehension that is he must be able topi ex 
observe distinctly and to the point those things 
whatever they are about which he is to reason 

b

 logical training 

but to do this requires a mind either logically 
acute or trained to acuteness for 

• the objects about which men reason are 
often very remote from ordinary experi 
ence and therefore hard to be observed at 
all e g gravitation — national wealth— 
the balance of power 
 even when they are not so they come 
complex before us in a complex kind of way the 

points in them which it is to our purpose 
to observe with a view to our intended 
reasoning are mixed up that is and en 
tangled with a number of other points 
which it is not to our purpose to observe 
because we do not want to reason about 
them our simple apprehension has then 
a complex object and may be called a 
complex simple apprehension 

on the other hand before we reason 

about any thing or species we must needs 

ineora determine which of its particular qualities 

append are lse on which our reasoning is to be 

note a based when we have confined for the 

present our notion or apprehension of the 

thing within the limits of these particular 

qualities it is plain that the object has 

become incomplex and the apprehension

 logical training 

arsdiri ft must aim at keeping the mind right in 

gens men 

tenu full possession that is of its best natural 

powers while it enquires or reasons on any 
given subject it must aim at preserving the 
mind from indistinct apprehension selfcontra 
dicting judgments and inconclusive reasonings 

 yet every art or science which we study 
faithfully is seen to answer these purposes in a 
greater or less degree geometry for instance 
or astronomy if so studied are almost certain 
to improve us in all these respects the fine 
arts in general and also many of the mechanical 
arts require clear observation and consistent 
judgment and conclusive reasoning and if 
we have practised these powers in any one art 
or science we are likely enough to find them 
avail us in any other which we undertake our 
faithful pursuit of one such subject gives us 
the logical temper as regards many others 

 in this way it is that most men become 
good reasoners it should be remarked how 
ever that while on the one hand it makes them 
firm and practical in their reasonings on any 
subject to which they are perfectly accustomed 
or on any subject nearly allied to their ordinary 
occupation so on the other hand the farther 
they recede from the common subjectmatter of

and its importance 



their reasonings the more likely they are to 
reason erroneously the geometrician has not 
necessarily the best appreciation of the argu 
ments in the wealth of nations far less of the 
kind of reasoning which moral science employs 
and the moralist or metaphysician who learns 
reasoning only by direct practice would pro 
bably be found unable to sum up the evidence 
in a criminal case so as to direct the verdict of 
the jury 

 it is this defect which the logical teacher 
attempts to supply he endeavours to shew 
clearly directly and explicitly what the mental 
conditions are on which all clearness in appre 
hension all consistency in judgment and all 
conclusiveness in reasoning must depend and 
thus to cultivate in his pupil a power of rea 
soning which shall apply to all subjects of 
enquiry whether moral metaphysical or simply 
practical there being in fact but a very limited 
number of processes applicable to reasonings 
however various he endeavours to investigate 
them one by one and to lay down the laws 
which must always regulate them whenever 
and to whatever subject they are applied 

 consequently he has to consider and treat instru 
of reasonings in so far as they are purely

 logical training and its importance 

mental and unaffected by the subjectmatter 
to which they are applied the reasonings of 
astronomical science are considered by him so 
far as they are purely mental processes inde 
pendent of the facts of astronomy he enquires 
not whether an argument observes or contra 
dicts the laws of astronomy history or poli 
tics but whether it observes or contradicts the 
general laws of reason and the general con 
ditions of knowledge such laws of reason 
are the following that two contradictories 
cannot be true at once — that if one of them 
is true the other is false — that if a law or cause 
is ascertained to be existing and uncounteracted 
all its instances or effects are sure to happen — 
that a law or cause cannot be true if it is un 
counteracted and yet some of the effects which 
ought necessarily to follow it do not do so in 
fact 

 these and a few others of the kind are 
plainly laws instrumental to all reasonings 
laws on which the validity of all reasoning on 
whatever subject must depend therefore the 
science of logic which enumerates and teaches 
us how to apply these laws is rightly called an 
art or science instrumental to all natural arts 
or sciences

 all reasonings so soon at least as they vox sig 
issue from the mind which conceived them conceptus 
must be clothed in words voces therefore 

it is to be expected that the logician who is 
happy and distinct in his apprehensions will 
also be happy and distinct in the words by 
which he expresses them 

 indeed the former distinctness depends in declarat 
great measure upon the latter we cannot tum ei 
have clear and distinct notions of any great 
number of objects without having clear and 
distinct names for them uncultivated minds 

in particular are absolutely unable except in 
objects of sensation to discern any distinctions 
which are not registered in common language

towards this logical accuracy in two ways in 
theatr the first place men of accurate and scientific 
knowledge are continually busy in the process 
of assigning to the objects which they investi

denote their fundamental qualities e g

psilanthropism these determinations of the 
learned as respects a language may be called 
by the general term institutum theatri 
according to the wellknown expression of 
lord bacon 
fori in the second place the common people with 

a kind of rude felicity are continually giving 
names to those things which interest them 
and those names generally express with homely

qualities of these things e g topgallant

is called a term when we assert or deny one 
term of another or rather the thing or quality 
implied by one term of the thing or quality 
implied by another we are said to make a 
proposition and if from one or more pro 
positions known to us we infer the truth of 
some other unknown or less known proposition 
then we have made an argument 

 the old logicians called a term a vox 
simplex a proposition a vox complexa and 
an argument a vox decomplexa for by 
 vox they understood not a word but an 
expression of thought in language

complete and finite apprehension or act of the

have not meaning enough for a term because 
unlike most adjectives they express not a 
quality which may be considered apart from the 
things possessing it but a process of our mind

are of the kind the only ones which there are 
c these forms of reflection are plainly inse 
parable from the things on which we reflect

they are joined with some predicate and are

plainly that which has no qualities which we know of— quod 
nihil habet dividui — but is an object of sensation known to 
us only by its occupying a certain space at a given time in

 above mere existence in time and space but that the qualities 

which they do express must be disengaged from individu

that tiling but as constituting a class of all possible things 
which possess these qualities the word individuum is 
therefore used in the less accurate but more common sense 
of an object of inward or outward sensation endued with 
very many qualities and existing in time and space this 
is what is meant when the individual is defined to be

be one and not more than one predicable they 
must express whenever they are used either 
one and one only predicate or else one and 
one only kind of subject e g elephant and

because the quality of sagacity is always the

is said to be equivocal 

 in like manner a predicable without analogum 
altering its sound or written form may express j 
two meanings different though connected i 
e g the word foot which when it means a j 
measure expresses part of the entire meaning j 
which lies in the word foot the human limb 
namely its length again review when it i 
means an examination of soldiers expresses 

part of the entire meaning of review when it 

means an examination of a new book and 

review in the latter sense also expresses part 

of its entire meaning in the former the 

former of these two examples then is of a 

partial meaning analogous to an entire meaning 

the latter of a partial meaning analogous to 

another partial meaning 

 every predicable whether subject orsecunda 
predicate must be secundae intentionis nis see 

 bp sanderson has defined the secunda p fi

i 



 predicables 

about which we are going to reason conse 
quently he would have defined the prima in ten tio 
to be the modus contemplandi materialise the 
way of noticing those things about which we are 
not going to reason 

 if we take any notice of objects of 
sensation about which we are not going to 
reason we notice them first as individual un 

w and known objects of sensation occupying a certain 

 space at a certain time and secondly as objects 

of sensation known to us by their individuality 

and by a vast number of facts and qualities 

from time to time observed by us 

 if on the other hand we endeavour to 
observe or understand these objects of the 
prima intentio for the purpose of drawing an 
inference about them e g as when a farmer 
artist or naturalist takes notice of a horse or 
an ox then we bring them under the second 
intention by subjecting them to those degrees 
of abstraction which make them subjects or 
predicates or propositions all the reasonings 
of the agriculturist about these subjects would 
probably end in assigning to them predicates 
connected with their strength so that when 

 when we are going to reason— not when we are going to 
write a treatise on logic

ever the subject horse or ox has occurred to 
him in the course of his reasoning it has 
suggested to him not an animal possessed of a 
vast number of qualities but an animal pos 
sessing in a certain degree the quality of 
strength he has therefore made abstraction 
from all the qualities which they possess as 
oxen and horses or as animals except the one 
quality of strength in like manner the sub 
ject horse or ox as occurring in the reasonings 
of an artist means an animal possessing a certain 
degree of picturesqueness and in proportion 
as the naturalist who classifies all natural ob 
jects is absorbed in the reasonings required for 
this purpose so will he be likely to contract 
his notion of horses and oxen and consider 
 them only as animals possessing horns hoofs or 
teeth of a certain kind 

 the most educated man is he who is 
capable of discerning most second intentions append 
in the things which he observes to discern ote 
most qualities in them on which reasonings 
may fasten but each of his separate trains of 
reasoning on any subject must depend on 
some one quality or some few qualities which 
we conceive it to possess and therefore each 
train hangs on a separate second intention

 when terms do not represent objects of 
sensation at all but objects of our own inward 
perception e g utility discretion wisdom 
desire c their common use is mostly so 
definite and restricted to so few qualities as 
to differ little if at all from their use in the 
secunda intentio 

 and lastly if any subject or predicate 
is made known to us by the immediate power 
of our own minds e g god truth eternity 
equality relation proportion c then in it 
the first and second intentions absolutely 
coincide since we have to abstract neither 
individuality of the subject vov and nor 
any irrelevant qualities in order to attain the 
sense in which such terms are used in any 
reasoning whatever 



chap iv 

abstraction 

 abstraction is the process by which weabstrac 
notice some part or parts of the nature of an 
individual thing or object of sensation without 
noticing for the time any other part or condition 

of its nature its object as an instrument of 
reasoning is to notice those parts of the nature 
of several things in which they agree with one 
another in so doing we are said to abstract 
their points of agreement from their points of 
difference b 

 its first degree is the abstraction from from od 
individuality ttov and wore in which it is incon 
ceivable that any two objects of sensation should 
agree this gives the logical subject or nomen 
logicum i e a class of things constituted 

• no qualities but those which we derive from objects of 
sensation afford a complete example of all the processes of 
abstraction subjects or predicates which come to us from 
any other source can of course undergo no abstraction from 
mv and irorh 

b not their differences from their agreements 



y 



 abstraction 

by their possession of very many qualities in 
see p common with which qualities any qualities 
henceforward to be observed will coexist e g 
if from any observed horse or ox we abstract 
its vov and wore it becomes to us not a single 
animal but a representative of its species a sub 
ject made what it is by the possession of certain 
see p kind qualities from the individual caesar in 
like manner we may abstract his vov and xori 
then his name becomes a nomen logicum 
implying all persons whatever if there are any 
such who possess all the same qualities which 
caesar possesses 
from many its second degree is the abstraction from 
q toes this subject of all qualities except those which 
involve some other quality e g in speaking 
of this tyrant i abstract not only from his 
individuality but from many of his qualities 
see p when i say this tyrant is odious in fact 
i think of none of his qualities except those 
which make up his tyrannicalness and involve 
his being odious 
from all its third degree is the abstraction from 
quality h an a qualities which we know of in 
individuals except one single quality e g 
when i am thinking of a field i may forbear 
from noticing its vou and woti its shape its

abstraction 



 



value and in fact any consideration whatever 
about it except its being green this gives 
a logical predicate but not a distinct one 
inasmuch as some fields are more some less 
green 

 the fourth step therefore is the abstracfrom de 
tion of degrees in a predicate e g our noticing srees 
that many things are green without noticing 

that one is more so another less this gives a 
distinct predicate 

 lastly when we assume some invisible 
cause or quality such as greenness or valour to qualities 
account for a things being green or resisting tracto 
danger we get a quality in abstracto e a predi

assumption is convenient from the difficulty of

logical distinctness in terms 

 the third and fourth chapters have fully 
answered one of the two main questions of the p 
first part of logic we have now to investigate 

the logical means for reducing to distinctness 
any indistinct term whatever be the kind of 
meaning which it expresses 

 this question is already answered in part 
since the two last processes of abstraction are 
adequate means for reducing indistinct predi 
cates to distinctness what remains is therefore 
to enquire how indistinct subjects be reduced 
to distinctness 

 we may be indistinct either as to the 
meaning of the name which expresses a subject 
or as to the nature of the thing or subject or 
as to both at once real knowledge of a sub 
ject may go along with indistinctness about its 
name because we may not know that the 
name applies to this subject ileal ignorance 
of the subject may go along with distinctness 
about the name because an erroneous applica 



k 



 logical distinctness in terms 

tion of the name may still be distinct but for 
the most part our idea of the name and of the 
thing are both indistinct at once and in the 
same degree 

 any clear statement which we believe 
about the subjects denoted by a term or the 
qualities which it implies is enough to produce 
nominal distinctness as to the term such 

definitio a statement is called either a nominal definition 
because it marks out a certain number of quali 
ties which the term is supposed to imply or a 
nominal division because it divides from all 
other existing subjects a certain class of sub 
jects supposed to be denoted by the term 
£• g red is the colour which we see on fine 
summer evenings in the sky 

 of course any definition which makes the 
nature of the subject distinct is a nominal 
definition also for in doing this it necessarily 
explains the term commonly used to signify 
this subject but not all nominal definitions 
explain the nature of the thing or subject

 but secondly our notion of the nature indistinc 
of the tiling may be too indistinct for the 
general purposes of reasoning that is we may 
not have realized what its most important quali 
ties are those which determine its place in the 
world those which lie most at the root of its 
likenesses and unlikenesses with all other things 
and are therefore seen to give rise to the most • 
numerous and connected reasonings about it 

 it is obvious that to have realized these 
qualities in any subject or species implies that 
we possess complete knowledge about it that 
is that we have compared it with all other 
subjects or species whatever on the other 
hand it is impossible to do this really inasmuch 
as we cannot have observed so many things 
the question is then first whether there are 
any logical marks applicable to all subjects or 
species whereby we may know that we have

marks how are they to be made to distinguish

with all others if we have fully compared it 
with the species most nearly allied to it in

indicated the agreements and differences between 
the species man and all the species which re 
semble him less than the chimpanzee does 
for many of the likenesses and all the unlike

chimpanzee will be unlikenesses between the 
two species man and worm in like manner 
we shall have distinguished him from all higher 
kinds which in any way resemble him e g from 
all other living beings from all other organised 
beings c c

have so many qualities in common as to be not 
easily distinguishable it is certain that some of 
the fundamental qualities of both kinds will be 
found among their points of resemblance we

we left out all those innumerable qualities in 
which they resemble the chimpanzee and which 
are summed up in one word when we call them 
both animals this quality or sum of qualities 
in which two related kinds agree with one 
another is said to constitute their genus or

 much more on the other hand should we differen 
mutilate our notion of mankind if we left out 

all the innumerable points in which their reason 
excels the chimpanzees instinct and which we 
sum up in one word when we call him rational 
this quality or sum of qualities in which two 
related kinds differ one from the other is called 
their differentia 

 when we say that the differentia sums 
up propria and the genus accidents it should 
be clearly understood that the differential 
quality is the cause of all propria which are 
summed up under it but the generic quality 
is not the cause of all accidents human 
reason is the cause of our being able to adapt 
means to ends perceiving tilings to be ridiculous

higher and subaltern kinds 

 two subjects may agree together in beiug 
members of one kind but differ from each other 
in being the one a member and the other not a 
member of some other kind e g two sounds 
may have in common all their various qualities 
which belong to them as sounds and yet only 
one of them may have those other various 
qualities which belong to the kind called 
musical sounds 

 on the other hand two subjects may 
agree together in being members both of a 
higher and a lower kind e g two sounds 
may be both of them musical sounds that is 
they may each of them belong to the kind 
which we call sounds and also to that lower 
kind which we call musical sounds if so 
they belong also to yet higher kinds that of 
vibratory motions that of motions c 

 the whole series of kinds to which any 
subject belongs are called its cognate genera 
a kind lower than any other given kind is 



higher and u baltic un kinds 



called subaltern to that with which it is com 
pared 

 every higher kind requires fewer quali 
ties or predicates as conditions of membership 
tlian a lower one does and therefore is able to 
embrace more subjects or members in it e g 
for a thing to be a motion requires fewer 
qualities than for it to be a vibratory motion — 
and tliis again fewer qualities than for it to be 
a sound or vibratory motion affecting the ear 
c c consequently the number of things 
or subjects which we call motions is greater 
than the number of those which we call vi 
bratory motions sounds or musical sounds 

 hence when the genus or higher kind totum lo 
in said to be a totum logicum as respects fflcun 
its related species or subaltern kinds the 
meaning is that it must necessarily denote a 
greater number of subjects than the species 

docs and when the species or lower kind 

is said to be a totum metaphysicum as re metaphysi 

spects its genus or higher kind the meaning 

is that it must needs imply more qualities than 

the genus does

summum genus 

summom unless every subject may belong to an 
unlimited number of kinds there must be some 
highest kind to which it belongs that is 
some kind containing so many members that 
if it contained more it would contain all things 
which are and implying so few qualities that 
if it implied fewer it would imply none but 
such as are common to all things which are 
the example taken in the last chapter was that 
of musical sounds and the highest kind to 
which they were there referred was that of 
motions if there is any yet higher kind to 
which motions may be referred it is position 
by position then we mean only one quality 
over and above that of existence which all 
things whatever possess and are incapable of 
farther analysis any kind of things which 
had fewer qualities would have no more than 
the quality of existence which is common to 
 since motion is position modified in successive time 



vil 



summum genus 

all things whatever consequently by referring 
any thing to a higher kind than position we 
should not be remedying indistinctness about 
its nature for things must be distinguished 
by means of some quality which one has and 
the other has not 

 again any higher kind of things as 
denoting more members or subjects than 
position denotes would in like manner denote 
all things which are the only higher band 
would be that which embraces all existing 
things or subjects by including any given 
subject in the universal body of entia we 
could of course throw no light upon its re 
lations with any other subject whatever 

 the summa genera or categories enu categories 
merated by aristotle are ten in number j 
substance relation quantity quality place i 
time order of parts state of being action f 
passion each of these implies one quality and 
no more each quality is incapable of farther 
analysis and so fundamentally different from 
all the others that we are not often at a loss 
which of these is the summum genus for any j 
given subject or species e g if we were 

defining republic we should obviously begin 

by calling it a relation between man and man 



 a m n mm if tfma k i k yu tfg t ws anw a ssri z 



 



 summum genus 

if we were defining an injury we should say 
that is an action subversive of certain rights 

 the only difficulty arises when two or 
more of these summa genera are related to 
one subject this may easily be the case 
inasmuch as one thing or subject may often 
be endowed with two or more sets of qualities 
fundamentally distinct one from another in 
defining proportion for instance we should 
evidently refer it to the two categories of 
quantity and relation making one of these 
its summum genus and the other its highest 
differentia paternity again is a quality 
possessed by one person relatively to another 
oppositeness is a relation in place between 
two subjects succession is relation in time 
reciprocation is relative action or passion 
motion as observed above is position modified 
in time 

 it very often happens that distinctness in 
a definition is quite sufficiently provided for 
without referring the subject to be defined to 
such high genera as the categories for in 
stance instead of defining a republic to be a 
relation c c between man and man we 
should simply say that it is a political consti 
tution in which all the members have power

infima species 

infima unless any given subject may belong to 

pecm an unlimited number of kinds there must also 
be some lowest kind or infima species to 
which it belongs some kind implying so many 
qualities that if it implied more they would 
not be kindqualities any longer and denoting 
so few members or subjects that if its subjects 
undergo any farther process of distinction one 
from another it must be on the ground either 
of their accidental qualities or of their indi 
viduality e g if musical sounds are sub 
divided they must be distinguished as being 
high or low sharp or fiat sounds or else 
because they occur at different times and in 
different places and therefore are not indi 
vidually the same sound 

 sandqualities are either generic or diffe 
rential and we have seen that the mark of 
a differential quality is its causing very many 
propria and that of a generic quality its

summing up very many accidents height or 
lowness sharpness or flatness if they are kind 
qualities at all must consequently sum up 
either many propria or many accidents it is 
plain however that they do neither of these 
but are simple accidents looking to and 
expressing nothing beyond themselves sub 
jects then do not differ in kind because one 
of them has any one of these qualities and 
another has not therefore musical sounds 
are a real or infima species distinguished 
from all other sounds by a differentia which 
does involve many propria but not admitting 
any new subdivision by means of any fresh 
quality as pregnant and differential

distinctness by logical division ok 
classification 

 having ascertained these logical or in 
tellectual marks by which the most important 
qualities in any subject may be recognised 
we are enabled to use them for the purpose of 
reducing indistinct subjects to distinctness by 
logical division and definition 
piviuo we shall have fully distinguished any 

given species from the species most nearly 
related to it and consequently from all others 
when we have disengaged or divided all the 
subjects denoted by it from the subjects of 
the summum genus to which it belongs the 
species republic for instance is perfectly 
distinguished from all other governments 
when we have separated all possible republics 
from all other possible relations 

 that is we have gradually to separate 
from the summum genus all those members

of it which do not enter into the infima species 
republic and none will enter into that 
species unless they have those qualities which 
our political knowledge shews us to be kind 
qualities of republics many relations will 
be put aside as not being human not between 
man and man many human relations will be 
put aside as not being social and finally 
many relations of a social kind between man 
and man are not subjects in the species re 
public because they are not on terms of strict 
political equality after this all remaining 
relations will be republics and we can 
realise to ourselves the nature and drift of the 
institutions in any popular state by classifying 
it along with the known class or species re 
publics 

 this process is naturally called division 
because it makes successive divisions of the 
subjects denoted by the name of the summuin 
genus 

 it is also naturally called logical division 
first because that which it divides or lessens at 
every step is the extent or logical quality in see p 
subjects secondly because the division at 

each step is logically that is selfevidently 
exhaustive 

eg

i distinctness by logical 

 the second step of the division in § is 
that in which human relations are divided into 
those which are social and those which are not 
social taking this for an example we observe 
that it is selfevidently exhaustive of all human 
relations every one however ignorant of 
political science or any other science would 
acknowledge that all human relations must be 
either social or not social consequently if 
republics are human relations at all it is 
plain that they must be either social or not 
social that is we have divided human 
relations into two lower kinds one or other 
of which must necessarily include republics as 
one of its subaltern kinds if on the other 
hand the division had not been exhaustive in 
this way we might have in fact divided human 
relations into two kinds neither of which 
would have included republics as one of its 

 subaltern kinds e g into those which are 

physical and those which are moral relations 

 other divisions might be exhaustive in 
fact our knowledge of political science might 
assure us that all human relations are made 
either for the sake of preserving life or for the 
sake of increasing the comforts of life but 
such a division is not selfevidently exhaustive 



division or classification 



 



there may conceivably be human relations 
with other objects but the steps of a logical 
division so accurate as to be a type for all 
accurate subdivision must be dichotomies 
the whole kind that is must be so divided 
into two lower kinds that whatever subject 
is not included in one of these lower kinds is 
selfevidently included in the other 

 hence in the clear language of the oldfinitum 
writers on logic a logical division was said 

to have on one side a nomen finitum the 
name of an exhaustible kind that of social 
relations a politician of sufficient experience 
and sufficient imagination might possibly register 
all existing social relations and devise all which 
are conceivable and on the other side a nomen 
infinitum or inexhaustible kind that of re infinitum 
lations not social for there is no conceivable 
limit to the relations of sympathy influence 
race manners c c which may exist be 
tween man and man 

 in such a series of cognate genera as append 
that we have been investigating it is plain that 

the subjects denoted by each subaltern kind 
are included in the subjects denoted by the 
kind immediately above it every republic 
is one among many social relations each

kind in fact contains among its subjects the

ever f one of the higher kinds may be a genus 
including the infima species 



chap xi 

distinctness by logical definition 

 since the infima species republic is indefinitio 
eluded in its summum genus it must possess 
the quality constituting this summum genus tee p 
that is it must be a relation and since it 
is included in all the kinds subaltern to that 
summum genus it must also possess the 
qualities constituting these kinds that is it 
must be human social and on terms of strict 
political equality these qualities being 
those in virtue of which the species republic see p 
is compared with all other kinds of relations 
must also be those in virtue of which it is 
compared with the relations most nearly re 
sembling itself such as monarchy and timo 
exacy therefore these qualities constitute its 
logical definition that which makes its nature 
perfectly distinct as respects the kinds most 
nearly resembling it 

d logical definition is therefore the process 
of ddup to the one quality implied by the 



 



distinctness by 



name of the summum genus all those kind 
qualities which are necessary to constitute the 
infima species to be defined we see at once 
that a republic is a relation adding to this 
in succession the farther qualities of being 
human social and politically equal we shall 
have registered the whole body of qualities 
which go to constitute the species republic 

 of these kindqualities those will be 
generic or material which sum up many 
see p accidents without causing them those will 
be differential or formal which sum up and 
cause many propria it is plain that the whole 
body of scientific or practical inferences about 
republics will rest on the fact that republics 
are on terms of political equality this is 
the part of their nature which makes them what 
they are to the reasoner their differentia as 
compared with the constitution most nearly 
resembling them and therefore also as com 
pared with all constitutions or all relations 
many qualities on the other hand in re 
publics are connected with the fact that they 
are human and social relations but none of 
the reasoners about republics will attempt to 
derive any of the qualities which they admire 
or reprobate from these considerations about it 



logical definition 



 



they are material and negative conditions to 
the existence of a republic and are therefore 
rightly said to be its generic and material 
qualities 

 in a series of cognate genera all qualities append 
belonging to any higher kind belong also to all 
the lower kinds consequently the infima 
species possesses the qualities constituting all 
its higher kinds in other words these qualities 
are predicated of the given subject or infima 
species either as its propria or accidents

degrees of distinctness 

 so far as we have yet seen the processes 
of logical division and logical definition are 
in fact one and inseparable because we cannot 
perform the one without at the same time 
performing the other we could not dis 
tinguish those relations which are to be called 
republics from all other possible relations 
without knowing what the qualities are which 
in fact distinguish republics from all other 
relations we divide or classify republics by 
means of our complete knowledge of the species 
republic and of the qualities which constitute 
it those qualities which are in fact essential to 
it and at the root of all its likenesses and un 
likenesses with other species and therefore 
make up its essential definition 

 it is however possible to make our notion 
of a species distinct by logical division or 
classification in two cases in which essential 
definition is impossible 



degrees of distinctness 



 



 we may ourselves be ignorant of the true deftnitio 
differentia although it is capable of being talis 
known e g we might know of a republic 

only that it is a social relation between man 
and man which makes individual pomp un 
welcome this last quality is not a differentia 
but a proprium because it is only one of many 
inferences from the fact of political equality 
in republics this definition is completely 
adequate if it is true that all republics dis 
courage individual pomp and that no other 
constitution does but it is only an accidental 
definition because it defines per genus et 
proprium and a proprium is no more than an 
accident except as deduced from a known 
differentia 

 we may be ignorant of the true dif dofinitio 
ferentia because it is beyond human know 
ledge this is the case in all physical species 
we can assign no differential qualities in the 
rafnia or any other species of plants none 
which sum up and cause all the differences 
manifest between it and other plants of such 
species none but a physical definition is possible 
we can make no summary of the differences 
between the rafnia and any other species and 
must therefore content ourselves with enume

 a physical definition like an accidental 
one is completely adequate to the species 
defined if it expresses a sufficient number of 
qualities it denotes all members of that 
species and no members of any other species 
but both these definitions express imperfect 
knowledge only and therefore cannot answer 
all the requirements of logical definition

per se b that is they do not put all the kind 
qualities of the species defined into a form con

will aim at giving us so clear an impression as 
to the acts of understanding expressed or im

intend to state that these two things are one

 general import of propositions 

 all propositions assert either a logical 
predicate of a logical subject or one logical 
subject of another 

 from the former of the two examples in 
logical § it appears that some propositions assert 
tions one logical subject of another so also do the 
append following propositions all meteoric stones are 

planetary bodies some revolutions are tu 
mults many philosophers are investigators of 
nature each of these is the expression of an 
act of logical division and imports that the 
subjects denoted by the word aerolite are in 
cluded among the subjects denoted by the word 
planet and the same as some of them — that 
some revolutions are included in the more 
general class of tumults c 
meuphy from the latter example in § it appears 
positions at other propositions assert a logical predi 
cate of a logical subject so also do the 
following propositions all zinc is malleable 
some republics are unsafe commerce tends 

 this division of propositions is most important if we are 
to distinguish the various processes of reasoning which are 
implied in our use of the various figures of the syllogism — 
as that between those of coexistence and those of dependence 
is most important for induction see pp c 
the terms logical and metaphysical as applied to pro 
positions are explained in the appendix note c

l in ftrgu 

j ment in argument — as when we infer that this tri 

 angle is equilateral and therefore equiangular 

 or that faraday is learned and therefore he is 

i interesting 

i every geometrical student will allow that 

j when we say this triangle is equilateral 

i therefore it is equiangular we mean such 

l triangles as this triangles whose sides have 

j this relative direction are equilateral and 

 therefore they are equiangular for this is the

form in which universals the only geometrical 
conclusions are invariably proved the pro 
position therefore though not universal as 
respects the species triangle is universal as 
respects this kind of triangle for it ascribes 
equilateralness to all such triangles as this 

 it follows that when we say this trade 
is profitable therefore it is to be pursued we 
mean such trade as this is profitable therefore 
it is to be pursued as a matter of fact no trade 
can possibly agree with this in all the qualities 
positive and negative which make it profitable 
and therefore no other is exactly such a trade 
but if there were any such then this trade 
would be a noraen logicum including it as 
well consequently though the proposition 
this trade is profitable therefore c is not 
universal as respects the species trade it is 
universal and exhaustive as regards trade of 
this exact sort 

 no one in like manner can agree with 
faraday in all the qualities positive and ne 
gative which go along with his learning if 
there were any such his name would be a 
nomen logicum including them conse 
quently though not exhaustive of the species 
man the proposition faraday is learned and

g singular propositions 

therefore interesting is exhaustive of all who 
profess the peculiar qualities of faraday 

 this difficult subject may be understood 
more clearly if we consider that in reasoning 
the tendency of the mind is to generalise all its 
terms to the utmost limit of which they are 
capable our knowledge of every subject about 
which we reason becomes a type for fresh con 
clusions about other subjects exactly or very 
nearly resembling it an argument however 
special its immediate conclusion may be has 
not done its work unless it has established some 
principle or generalization capable of directing 
us in parallel reasoning and in framing its 
separate propositions we desire to make each of 
them express a truth which has something 
general in it even such a proposition as 
faraday is learned endeavours to clothe itself 
in the form of a principle the natural ten 
dency of our mind is to think of only those 
qualities in faraday which connect themselves 
with his learning whether as causes or effects 
and to have them in mind when we use his 
name as that of a learned man or make any 
assertion about his learning 

 to this view it may be objected that particular pro 
positions do not aim at any generalisation or imply any 




singular propositions 

 hence chiefly arises the importance of 
the scholastic doctrine about the second in p 

tention what it ought to teach us is first u 

that the subjects of propositions in an argument 

imply mostly very much fewer qualities than if 

the same terms would out of argument when j 

they express mere intuitions from which nothing ji 

has been abstracted and secondly that the 
qualities which they come in this way practically j 

to single out and hold up to view are mostly r 

those which we consider to have the closest 

natural connection with the one quality implied j 

in the predicate and to be probably the cause f j 

of its belonging to the subject the former of j 

these obvious truths is implied when we are j 

said in argument to reform recudere the j 

natural meaning of our terms the latter when j 

we are said to adapt them moderari for the j j 

purposes of the argument in which we are j 
engaged f 

thing beyond what they state tins of course is the case j 

but then the very fact that they are particular and exceptional j •¦ 

propositions proves that no dependence can be established 

betweon the qualities implied by the subject and the one 
expressed in the predicate if i say that some philosophers 
are discontented i imply that there is as for as i know no 
dependence between philosophy and content or between 
philosophy and discontent but this is not the case when 
i say that carlyle and wordsworth are contented •

indefinite propositions 

 indefinite propositions are said to be indefinite in 

quantity when there is no sign to inform us 

 whether they are universal or particular e g 

equilateral triangles are equiangular republics 

i are given to change neither of these propo 

j sitions is preceded by any sign of quantity 

f such as all or some and therefore it is 

j uncertain to what extent we may consider them 

i valid whether as applied to all triangles or 

j republics or only to some of each kind 

ex materia whether they are one or the other sub 
jectively that is in the mind of him who makes 
them must depend on the degree of his know 
 ledge and on his intention in making them 

 if he is ignorant whether all republics are or 

• are not given to change or if again he only 

i intends to assert this quality of a certain 

number of republics then the proposition 
which he makes is particular if he knows 



indefinite propositions 

this fact and intends to assert it about all 
republics then his proposition is universal 

 whether they are one or the other ob 
jectively that is whether human knowledge is 
sufficient to make them universals — whether 
they ought to be universals or can be more 
than particulars must depend on the degree of 
knowledge which the best informed of men 
have yet gained about their subjects if any 
one knows as much about republics as educated 
men know about triangles it is plain that the 
proposition republics are liable to change 
may be universal as well as the proposition 
equilateral triangles are equiangular if on 
the other hand no one knows enough about 
republics to declare from their essential 
qualtoesna farther proprium of changeableness 
it is plain that the proposition republics are 
changeable is to the whole human race a

quantity of predicate 

 we have seen that the quantity universal

the extent ascribed to the subject there is 
another less important consideration about 
every proposition namely the quantity of its 
j predicate 

 this differs from the quantity of the 

j subject in not being dependent either on the 

ii will of the speaker or on his knowledge it 

is a consequence simply of the affirmative or 
negative quality of his assertion and there 
 fore lies midway between considerations as to 

the quantity of propositions and considerations 
as to their quality

 all affirmative propositions have an uninaffirm

with some members of the higher kind denoted

quality the predicate is not applied to as many 
subjects as possible and is therefore undis 
tributed e g all magnetic phenomena are

by opposition and conversion

quantity and quality granting that any tory 
proposition whatever a e i o is true we 
know that a proposition of the same terms 
opposed to any one than in quantity and 
qualities o i e a must be false for it 
contradicts it and it is a law of the mind 
that whatever contradicts truth is false e g 
if all poetry is granted to be corrupting we 
know without reasoning that no one given 
poetical work can be uncorrupting 

 contradictory opposition is naturally the contradic 
relation between any given proposition and the logical 
objection urged against it by an opponent 
the objection to an universal affirmative is a 
particular negative and vice versa any other 
opposition would preclude the continuance of 
an argument if two reasoners made contrary 
statements a and e neither proposition 
would be susceptible of clear and easy proof 
and in many cases neither would be suscepti 
ble of proof at all if two reasoners made f 
subcontrary statements i and o they would

reasonings deduction and induction 



 we call a man logical in his reasonings 
when all his conclusions are warranted by his 
evidence that is when he neither deduces logical 
incorrect inferences from any principles or 
laws which are known to him nor infers in 
correct principles or laws from the instances 

or facts of which he is possessed 

 if he avoids the former fault we should 
say that he is logical in his deductive rea 
sonings or in his syllogisms if he avoids 
the latter we say that he is correct in his 
inductive reasonings or in his inductions

we desire that is to be able to deduce all 
unobserved particulars from our inductively 
obtained universal

those of the mere understanding inasmuch r ea on

that some acids redden vegetable blues but 
that lemonjuice reddens vegetable blues 

 such an inference can be allowed only 
in virtue of a third proposition which connects

position lemonjuice is an acid does 
require the universal and the connecting pro 
positions position together make the evidence in any 
single • deductive argument and are called

 if there are any axioms so general as to 
lie at the root of all deductive reasoning it 
is plain that they will nearly resemble the 
axioms in geometry mechanics c which 
sciences arc the most perfect and simple in 
stances of deductive reasoning in fact the 
axioms of mathematics will bo less general 
examples of the more general axioms from 
which all deductions or syllogisms derive 
their validity 

 one of the two most general axioms in 
the familiar science of geometry is that two 
things which both agree in quantity with any 
third agree in quantity with one another 
this is only selfevident in virtue of the still 
higher and more general axiom that two 
things which agree in any thing with the same 
third agree in the same tiling one with 
another

ative or negative e g mountainous countries

major of their principles are to be a sufficient ground

we have grounds for knowing that all moun

could not necessarily infer of any mountain 
ous country unknown to us that it is thinly 
peopled and unless we had grounds for 
asserting that no uncharitable acts are good 
for states we could not necessarily infer that 
any given act of this character is bad for 
states the major premiss in this figure is 
therefore always universal because it must 
state a principle and all principles are so 
 the minor premiss must be affirmative

second figure 

middle arguments are said to be in the second 

extensive figure when the middle term or term used 
for proof is more extensive than either the 
major or minor term e g in the argu 
ment 

all real wisdom is practical 

the philosophy of m comte is not practical 

therefore it is not real wisdom 

the middle term practical is a predicate 
asserted of our subject and denied of another 
it is consequently more extensive than either 
of its subjects as being the predicate or 
term of greater extent in both premisses 

 hence the business of syllogisms in the 
second figure is to distinguish two subjects 
for no affirmative relation whatever can be 
proved to exist between two subjects on the 
ground of their having one single predicate in 
common £ g man and brutes are both 
animals but this does not inform us either

that all brutes or that some brutes are men nor 
yet that all men or some men are brutes the 
conclusion of any syllogism in this figure is 
consequently a logical proposition negative p 
in quality and distinguishing two subjects 
from one another 

 the use of an argument in this form implies 
implies that our knowledge respecting the sub knowledge 
jects of the argument is deficient our having f ub 
such complete knowledge as our use of the 
first figure implies about the subjects 
of reasoning must make it obvious to us 
whether one subject include another or not 
as soon as we understand the astronomical 
principles of the solar system we know 
whether mars jupiter c are included in the 
species planetary bodies but on the other 
hand there are physical subjects in which we 
do not possess knowledge sufficient for full 
and connected reasoning we may not know 
whether shooting stars e g are fragments 
drawn up from the earth and then returned to 
it or whether they are small planetary bodies 
drawn from their orbits by the earths attrac 
tion in this case we naturally search for 
marks or predicates by which it may be dis 
tinguished from one or other of these kinds

bodies drawn up from the earth would not 
always appear in one part of the sky 

shooting stars do so appear 

therefore shooting stars are not bodies drawn 
up from the earth 

 in particular it implies that we have not 
the kind of knowledge which is embodied in 
the affirmative minor premiss of a syllogism 
in the first figure we should not attempt 
to distinguish two subjects by comparing them 
with the same predicate if it were an acknow 
ledged or obvious fact that they include one 
another or if it were well known in what higher 
kinds or classes each is to be included an 
argument in the second figure must therefore 
when it is used in connexion with other argu 
ments be either 
 a preliminary inquiry as to the relations 
of subjects to one another when our own 
knowledge cannot supply a minor pre 
miss to a syllogism in the first figure 
or 
 an objection to the assumption of com 
plete knowledge which leads an opponent 
to include one subject in another as he 
frames the minor premiss to some syllo 
gism in the first figure 



ecxd figure 

 arguments in this figure as they have 
always a negative conclusion must always 
derive their validity from the canon of nega 
tive arguments if it is selfevident that two 
things differ from one another if one agrees 
with a certain third from which the other 

differs then it is also selfevident that twoctomfor 

d figure 
subjects differ from one another as never 

including or sometimes not including one 
another if there is any predicate which never 
can be said of one but always or sometimes 
of the other therefore an argument in the 
second figure is as plainly selfevident as one 
in the first figure although as we have 
shown it is not equally important in argu 
ments 

 one premiss must be negative because special 
the predicate or middle term must be denied 

of one of the two subjects which are to be 
distinguished in the conclusion one premiss 
must be universal because two subjects are 
distinguished wholly or in part from one an 
other on the ground that the former altogether 
excludes a predicate which the latter always 
or sometimes admits or on the ground that 
the former always admits a predicate which 
the other always or sometimes excludes

deficient in that knowledge of principles 
which is embodied in the major premisses

figure for in knowing accurately what is 
the nature of all the predicates or qualities 
which may be asserted of a subject we know 
also of what principles it is the subject 
and so far as we are ignorant of the true 
nature of its qualities or predicates we do 
not know of what principles it may be the 
subject it follows that if we attempt to 
compare or distinguish two qualities by con 
sidering them as predicates of one subject 
it must be either because we ourselves are 
ignorant of their nature and therefore do not 
know whether and in what degree they in 
clude or exclude one another or because the 
person with whom we are arguing is ignorant 
of these points an argument in the third 
figure is therefore when used in connexion 
with other arguments either 

a an instance bearing upon some principle 
which we desire to ascertain for ourselves

other premiss is problematical only if one 
of the two subjects must possess some one 
quality or predicate which the other does not 
or cannot possess then the conclusion is

ducing its effects for ever if uncounteracted 
but this axiom depends for its validity upon 
the more general principle that it is the 
nature of causes or laws to produce their 
whole effect if uncounteracted 

 from this general principle it follows 

 that if a problematical antecedent or 
cause is granted really to exist without 
counteraction all its deducible instances 
or effects arc sure to follow e g if 
i grant that the sixth commandment is a 
primary duty then murdering tyrants or 
any one else is a crime 

j that a problematical antecedent or 
cause is proved either not to exist or 
to be counteracted if any one of its 
deducible instances or effects is not pro 
duced e g if cruelty to brutes is right 
they cannot be creatures like ourselves 
but they are so therefore cruelty is not 
right 

 these two canons are laws as ele 
mentary and as plainly selfevident as those 
on which categorical syllogisms rest and 
they are so different from these that con 
ditional syllogisms cannot be resolved into 
categorical syllogisms any more than me

reasoning from hypothesis 

chanical reasoning can into geometry this 
may be seen with clearness by referring to 
part ii c vii where it was shewn that con 
ditional propositions cannot be reduced to 
categorical propositions without losing either 
the problematical character of their ante 
cedent and consequent or the dependence 
between them 

 and secondly by examining the relation 
of the two premisses in the conditional syllo 
gism as compared with those in the categorical 
syllogism those in the latter contain asserv 
tions entirely different but both equally certain 
the minor premiss in conditionals on the 
other hand is the antecedent of their major 
premiss repeated over again with more cer 
tainty the major premiss assumes only that 
the antecedent is possible the minor premiss 
assumes it as actual these two premisses 
then cannot be like those of the categorical 
syllogism the assumption of the same person 
at the same time they must be either 
assumptions by the same person at different 
times or by different persons at the same time 

 when the two assumptions are our own usoof con 
at different times we adopt this form of argu uona s 
ment in order to know whether a certain pos

sible cause will account for the effects which 
we wish to investigate before we undergo the 
labour of ascertaining that it is a really exist 
ing cause e g if the axis of the earth varies 
in its direction towards the sun this will ac 
count for the seasons of the year but it is 
constantly varying therefore its directions 
account for the seasons of the year the 
reason why we put an argument in this form 
is that when we desire to account for the sea 
sons of the year it is not to our purpose to 
observe constantly the directions of the earths 
axis with regard to the sun until we know 
that the changes of the seasons will be thus 
accounted for 

 when the cause or antecedent is as 
sumed as real by ourselves but only as pro 
blematical by another person we wish to 
convince him first that if real it will produce 
the effect this is simply a process of rea 
soning of which he is as capable as ourselves 
and secondly that it is real this implies 
knowledge which by the hypothesis we pos 
sess and he does not so that either he will 
accept our authority or be convinced by our 
proof that the cause or antecedent which he 
allows to be possible is also real

disjunctive syllogisms 



disjunc 
tives 



their law 



 syllogisms are said to be disjunctive 
when their principle is a disjunctive proposi 
tion or proposition in which two problematical 
assertions not logically contradictory are 
assumed to be the only possible assertions 
which can be made as to the subject of infer 
ence and therefore as contradictories e g 

either brutus was a patriot or ccesar was 

murdered 
but cresar was murdered 
therefore brutus was not a patriot 

 consequently the principle on which 
they depend is that of two contradictories 
one must necessarily be true and the other 
false so that one of these two assertions 
must needs be admitted and the other denied 
this ground is therefore as plainly selfevi 
dent as that of any conditional or categorical 
syllogism 




 disjunctive syllogisms 

 any attempt to reduce a disjunctive disjunc 
syllogism to four conditionals omits thef b e 
condition implied in all disjunctive proposi 
tions that these two possible assertions are 
the only assertions possible about the subject 
of inference far less could a disjunctive 
be reduced to a categorical syllogism for 
problematical propositions which are to be 
come actual only by denying some other 
cannotbe reduced into propositions expressing 
absolute knowledge 

 the reason why we endeavour sometimes their use 
to bring arguments into this form is that 
whenever we possess knowledge enough of a 

l subject to reason about it at all one of two con 
¦ tradictories respecting it must either be within 
our experience or easily inferrible from it 
e g in the instance given in § we under 
stand too little for the purposes of reasoning 
about the claims of our country and the sixth 
commandment if one or other of the two 
propositions caesar was murdered or brutus 
was a patriot does not come within the range 

ij these reductions hove never been seriously attempted 
in the common works on logic yet they must needs be 
familiar and constant operations of the mind except on the 
supposition that categorical and hypothetical propositions 
are fundamentally different

contradictory propositions about the question

propositions must be so related that either

be shewn to be dissimilar or combined

arguments not strictly logical with a

 arguments cannot be called strictly

 in the premisses e g 

all voluntary deformities are selfimposed 
this lameness is selfimposed 
therefore it is voluntary 

the real premiss on which this conclusion 
rests is that all selfimposed deformities are 

p voluntary but we have seen in part ii that 
this proposition is in fact immediately implied

ethical knowledge or experience could not

conclusions unless the assumed premisses

assumption must spring not from the absence 
of particular knowledge of facts or principles 
in any one department of reasoning but from 
certain general tendencies of the understand 
ing to frame principles amiss in all possible 
departments of reasoning if a proposition 
or principle is assumed because of any such 
tendency it is illogically assumed and the 
operation of any such tendency is a logical 
mark of probable falsehood in principles

ciples of other persons or by certain judg 
ments or principles of its own if so we jj 
reason illogically because it is a mark of c 
the logical mind to know what amount of j 
evidence or principle is required to sustain jj 
a given conclusion jl 
 the undue influence of other mens judgments 
judgments may be briefly summed up under j 
a few principal heads we should consider 
any reasoner to be illogical who relied un 
duly on the authority of wise men in points jj 
where they had fewer sources of knowledge 
than ourselves or on that of a number of 
witnesses when he knows that they arc not 
independent witnesses or on that of the f 
ancients when the question is one of criticism 
or accurate observation and he is aware of 
the difference between the ancients and the 
moderns in this respect or on that of the 
modems when the question is one on which j 
simple meditation or feeling may pronounce 
ex cathedra or on that of the popular voice 
or of his mends or teachers or on that of 
formulae canons of taste proverbs c any 
one likely to be misled by such arguments 
from authority would naturally and rightly 
be said to have an illogical mind 



 false conclusions from 

judgments the undue influence of our own judg 
i merits leads to dogmatism if we maintain 

 and enforce them without connecting or en 

 deavouring to connect them witli any prin 

f ciple e g as when an instinctive dislike 

 for educated servants is made a reason for 

 opposing general education 

 or to fallacies of induction if we main 

i tain and enforce them as leading to principles 

 which they do not warrant e g it is illo 

j gical to reason that states must needs have 

a youth manhood and decay because some 
 states which we remember have passed 

 through these stages 

 • or lastly to fallacies of application 

 if we maintain and enforce them as leading 

to principles warranted in themselves but 

 fundamentally inapplicable to the arguments 

which we are framing 

 it would be illogical for instance in 
a person possessing any information about 
chemistry and mechanics to argue without 
examination that oxygen and hydrogen when 
mixed together must produce a joint effect 
just equal to the sum of their separate effects 
this would be an illogical application to 
chemical bodies of a principle which is 

i i s 



evidence illogically assumed 

familiarized to us only by the action of 
mechanical forces a logical temper would 
have induced the reasoner to examine be 
forehand whether this principle applies to 
chemistry or not 

 again diodotus in the wellknown 
speech accuses gleon of illogical reasoning 
as to the treatment of the mytilenian pri 
soners if principles applicable to one re 
lation between two parties are transferred 
to another without any examination as to 
their applicability to these new circum 
stances the argument violates the common 
laws of the reason which dictate that general 
laws should be applied only to those subjects 
which they include 

 lastly it is illogical in the highest 
degree and a surrender of our better reason 
to make principles of taste an evidence for 
physical or moral facts e g fire is the 
noblest element in the universe therefore 

 the logical temper would not have hindered him from 
mistaking the action of forces after examination but it 
would have hindered his assuming it without examination 
the common use of the terms fallacy and fallacious as 
applied to such assumptions shows that he who makes 
them is popularly considered to be violating some law of 
his own reason

deduction from the higher axiom that 

 this and the axiom from which the second canon is 
derived are incapable of being laws to establish any argu 
ment or detect any fallacy for no two tilings differ so 
much as not to have a single quality in common with one 
another and therefore with any third thing possessing the 
same quality and no two things agree so entirely as that 
no one single quality shall be possessed by the one and not

the other differs they are not proved to 
differ from one another a deduction 
from the higher canon that two things 
cannot be different from one another if

which the other differs 

 any case to which these canons apply 
must be one in which more than two terms

in which the major and minor terms are 
compared with two different middle terms 
or one in which the kind of agreement as

that can be done is to lay down logical marks

they represent little besides these notions

 terms ambiguous in themselves 

by every one as expressing the commonest 
acts of the understanding fallacies there 
fore are apt to arise when they are transferred 
from the institutum fori or common use to 
the institutum theatri or speculative use 
and vice versa such notions are expressed 
more frequently in the major or middle tenn 
than in the minor and consequently the two 
former are those which are most likely to be 
ambiguous for this cause but 

 tenns are likely to be used ambiguously 
when they represent single things or effects 
as we perceive them occurring in nature or 
their first and most obvious generalizations 
for then the qualities which they imply are 
so manifold and so hard to arrange in order 
of importance that the meaning is indefinitely 
altered by the different experience of this or 
that person such are 

 the names of common phenomena as 
heat hardness beauty c 

 names of complex historical events e g

punishment rights of labour organiza

 the terms most frequently made am 
biguous from this second cause are the minor 
and middle terms for the words just enu 
merated are mostly the subjects of our con 
clusions as expressing the things about 
which we reason 

 the middle term is therefore of all the 
terms the most likely to be ambiguous since 
it may be so from either of the two principal 
causes first given the major term is of all 
the least likely because it seldom expresses 
either a complex subject or a merely intel 
lectual quality examples of fallacy for either 
kind of ambiguity may readily be found in 
abp whatelys logic and elsewhere

logical fallacies of quantity in

quantity 



 a reasoner may be perfectly clear as 
to the material qualities which the terms of 
his syllogism really imply and yet confused 

fallacies of as to the logical quantity which they possess 
as included in some one of its propositions 
this is the case if he expresses in his con 
clusion a relation between its major and 
minor term which the premisses did not 
imply or implied less generally 

 drawing any inference from particular 
premisses expresses a relation between these 
terms which the premisses did not imply at 
all eg 

some imitations of war ore useful 
some hunting is on image of war 
therefore some hunting is useful 

all hunting may without contradicting the 
premisses be asserted to be one of those 
images of war which are not useful such an

logical fallacies of quantity c 

argument then implies a deficient induction 
in the major premiss 

 no inference can be drawn from any undistri 
premisses in which the middle term is not middle 
distributed or taken universally e g 

some influxes of gold bring prosperity with 

them 
the repayment of profitable investments is 

an influx of gold 
therefore it must bring prosperity 

this inference is only justified by the major 
premiss that all influx of gold is favourable 
to trade which in this syllogism was not 
assumed such an argument is therefore a 
fallacy because of the insufficient induction 
in the major premiss 

 an illicit process of the minor term illicit pro 
expresses in the conclusion an universal andinor 
constant relation of the minor term to the 
major term when only a particular and 
exceptional one was asserted in the minor 
premiss as existing between the minor and 
middle term e g

if this conclusion is proved the minor pre

independent but this was not the case 
and therefore the argument is fallacious from 
the insufficient induction in the minor pre 
miss 
ofmor an illicit process of the major term 
when by drawing a negative conclusion we 
decide that the major term in the conclusion 
altogether excludes the minor there being in 
the premisses no evidence that it excludes 
the minor term at all e g 

all primary motives lead to good actions 
compassion is not a primary motive 
therefore it does not lead to good actions 

the conclusion is proved only on the sup 
position that all motives which lead to good 
actions must be primary and therefore the 
argument is fallacious from assuming with

difficulty induces employers to attempt level

to say that two things are equal to the same 

as it is to say that they are equal to another 

those who like bentham maintain this view 

 seem to do so from a confused view of what 

the question means objectively and in the 

j • nature of things it is precisely the same 

i j quality which makes things equal to the same 

and equal to one another subjectively and 

j as representing our knowledge these two 

assertions are by no means the same we 

 may be perfectly aware that two things are 

equal to the same third and yet we may never 

have been induced to consider whether they 

are equal to one another or not and on the 

other hand we may know that they are equal 

to another without having ever thought of 

any third thing to which both are equal 

 this is seen still more plainly in the 
case of other axioms two straight lines 
cannot enclose a space but it is not the 
same thing to say that they are straight lines 
and to say that they do not enclose a space 
lines which are not parallel must meet but 
saying that they are not parallel is not the 
same thing as saying that they will sometime 
meet we should not be able to get the 
latter conclusion from the former without the

power which we possess of imagining infinite lj 

space and these lines produced into it • 

 these axioms and others resembling 

them give the form or law to demonstra ji 

tions in geometry and mechanics the acts ¦ 

of reason whereby we perceive and acknow 

ledge the cogency of the remotest mathema v

extensions of the acts of reason implied in 
assuming the axioms on which the science j jj

 the matter of mathematical reasoning detini l 
consists of certain lines figures quantities 
and forces assumed to exist and to be capable 
of entirely accurate measurement or definition 
geometry treats of lines assumed to be entirely 
straight of figures assumed to be exact tri 
angles squares circles c and so to answer 
exactly to the definition of these figures 
this assumption though not rigorously true 
is sufficiently so for the purposes of mathe 
matical reasoning 

 some writers have maintained that the 
law or form of mathematical reasoning is to 
be found in the definitions not in the 
axioms they did not perceive that it is 

 this assumption is contained in the postulates

from observing that its three angles are equal 
to two other angles which are undoubtedly 
equal to two right angles so that the de 
monstration rests on the first axiom and 
not on the definition or description of a 
triangle 

 every step of a demonstration contains 
a syllogism in the first figure and all its 
conclusions must be affirmative for in 
demonstrations we are always acquiring from 
the completest possible knowledge and putting 
our conclusion entirely beyond question 
which only the first figure can do and the

when we read euclid i we have not become f ¦

 higher or fower morals or intellect in 
the writer than the alleged author could have 
had this is a most important element in 
the argument the writer of the epistles is 
 a dreaming pedant with his head upon his 
hand most unlike the rule of a million sub 
jects in early greece he is busied about the 
most trivial subjects intreating odes and 
failing to obtain them from stesichoms whose 
price for odes must have been well known 
rewarding his physician with immense wealth 
in days when the best physicians were hired 
for the use of a city at two talents a year 
and giving us none of the lively details which 
we invariably derive from the familial letters 
of a man of action 

 if the alleged writer had not lived in 
such ancient times and the epistles had been 
in manuscript alleged to have been written by 
his hand then other heads of argument laid 
down by bentham would have applied to this 
controversy we might have been called upon 
to judge whether the character the paper the

 many of these ingredients of controversy 
now seem likely to occur in the ignatian con 
troversy in the hands of bishop pearson its 
arguments were step by step the same as those 
afterwards used by bentley with the additional 
difficulty however that positive signs of truth 
are harder to discover than signs of falsehood 
the burthen of proof therefore lay not with 
the bishop but with his opponents his 
positive proofs therefore generally consist in 
shewing that the opinions and expressions 
objected to as strange and improbable as 
coming from st ignatius were in fact such as 
the theology of the first century was likely

aldrich like the logicians whom he followed 
has chosen to consider simple apprehension as 
applying not to things but to the terms ex 
pressing them he therefore considers that by 
incomplex simple apprehension we take notice 
of one term apart from other terms and that in 
complex simple apprehension we take notice of 
a term along with other terms — cum ordine 
quodam et respectu it is not evident from 
which kind of simple apprehension he derives 
the terms used in argument if we follow the 
natural course and consider that our appre 
hension has respect to the things about which 
we reason then it plainly becomes incomplex by 
considering the things or qualities about which 
we are reasoning as distinct from all other things 
or qualities this is the ground of the explana 
tion in the text

j wc are not to consider that aldrich means to 

express any opinion about the origin of language 
when he states that it is vicarium ex instituto 
the logical quality in language is distinctness 
and so far as this quality is produced by any 
operations of the understanding or keason so 
far is language affected by logic and a subject 
for the logician to consider

notes 

to do bo when a term was said to be used in 
the second intention the meaning seems origi 
nally to have been that it was registered under 
logical ideas or secuiidt© notiones that is 
that it was classed with other similar terms 
under some technical head such as subject 
predicate generic quality accident or the like 
still we do not class terms under technical heads 
every time we use them in reasoning although 
we do when we are writing a treatise on logic 
the later explanation given in the text is therefore 
more in agreement with the brief definitions of 
the term secunda intentio which are given by 
aldrich and bp sanderson and it is incom 
parably more important the words recudit et 
moderate can hardly imply any thing else but 
the modification of the meaning of terms see

note e page 

the subject of real definition has been 
treated here in order to avoid departing from the 
ordinary arrangement of logical manuals the 
teacher of logic should however remember that 
it only becomes fully intelligible when treated as 
it is by aristotle in connection with the subject 
of demonstration wc must have gained the

in part i chap x § compared with chap xi 
§ we leam how it is that when we have reduced 
a term to distinctness we have attained both to 
some propositions and to some arguments about 
it this illustrates the connection of the dictum 
de omni et nullo with aristotles scheme of ovofa 
and explains categ ii § 



note gtpage 

much difficulty has sometimes been felt in 
admitting the canons and the dictum de omni 
et nullo together as concurrent laws of valid 
seasoning any one who examines this question 
will see that they are two parallel forms of the 
principle of contradiction that a thing cannot at 
the same time be and not be another thing possess 
or not possess a given quality nor will he doubt 
that the dictum with the parallel principles in 
the other two figures are the best exposition of 
the laws of sound reasoning whereas the canons

simply logical fallacy 



note h page 

the three figures admitted by aristotle havo 
been distinguished from one another in the text 
because each implies a different amount of know 
ledge respecting the matter of its reasonings 
the fourth figure was not thought of by aristotle 
because it implies no difference of knowledge from 
that which is implied in the first figure it is 
true that a navigator landing upon an unknown 
island would very probably argue in this way 

all the plants in this island are cruciform plants 

no cruciform plants are poisonous 

therefore no poisonous plants grow in this island 

and that there is na absurdity or unnaturalness 
in thus settling the question of fact before the 
principle is applied or even thought of still the 
argument itself when made in no respect differs 
from one in the first figure 

no cruciform plants are poisonous 

all the plants in this island are cruciform 

therefore none of them are poisonous
