by your first establishing and subsequently foster

and publishing inedited oriental mss which has 
made your name known throughout this country and 
the rest of the civilized world leads me in addition 
to the many obliging attentions i have received 
from yourself during an intercourse of several 
years to place under the protection of your lord

nature of language the noblest instrument at the

disposal of man and to which he is as much in 
debted for his privilege as a reasoning being as 
he is to providence for having made him a rational 
creature i am induced to hope that the public at 
large may be roused to feel the high importance of 
the subject as well as the value of correct notions 
wih regard to it in physical science and that 
every man of reflection may become aware of the 
true nature of that upon which as the adjunct of 
reason is founded the moral excellence of the human 
race

preface 



this little work must not be mistaken for an idle 
disquisition about words so far from this being 
the case its object is to consider the very founda 
tion of human reasoning and consequently of 
human knowledge the current of metaphysics 
runs remarkably slack at present in this country 
and perhaps the occasion is only the more favour 
able for sounding the depth of the abyss and dis 
covering the amount of its utility to mankind 
whether a period of the world so peculiarly de 
voted to pleasure and the practical business of life 
is one fitted for fixing the attention of the minds 
of men upon their own misconceptions will be best 
learnt from experiment but should it turn out 
that they are so absorbed in their devotion to party 
politics railways steamengines sonatas and secta 
rian controversy as to preclude all other subjects 
these pages must of course share the fate of every 



 preface 

thing produced out of season in that case they 
must wait for another revolution of the cycle before 
they may be read it is much more natural that 
mankind should prefer what brings them present 
applause without much labour of thought than 
devote themselves to studies that are in some 
measure against the ordinary tendencies of their 
minds though some like the good man in moliere 
who was so surprised when informed that he had 
been all his life talking prose will perhaps be 
astonished to learn that though they absolutely 
detest the name of metaphysics they never draw 
an inference however obvious that is not the result 
of a metaphysical process equalling in difficulty 
the generality of the remarks that i have prepared 
for their consideration 

i have endeavoured notwithstanding to make 
what i had to say as simple and clear as was in my 
power and i have in consequence sacrificed ele 
gance to precision and perspicuity 

the english are in an eminent degree gre 
garious thinkers and whatever is catered for their 
understandings is generally taken up or neglected 
by all should curiosity however lead any one to 
open this volume who has never turned his atten 
tion to metaphysical pursuits let him not throw it 
down in despair as it is particularly intended for 



preface m 



the relief of those whose tender consciences may 
occasionally accuse them of being ignorant of so 
important a branch of knowledge now the 
perusal of this little work will save him a world of 
thought and also of regret for his ignorance this 
will surely be a strong inducement to the lover of 
truth to persevere in reading it through but if 
he be of a bold and inquisitive turn of mind he 
will find in it a guide by the assistance of which 
he may explore all the dark and mysterious laby 
rinths of metaphysics let him however beware 
how he separates himself from it while led on by 
the fascination of the moment for such are the 
charms of some of those exquisite specimens lt 
misapplied genius that he may utterly lose himself 
and stray far from all human relief should such 
a result take place his case is desperate 
having no means of extricating himself he will be 
reduced to the situation of milton s fallen angels 
who are represented as reasoning on these very 
subjects 

and found no end in wand ring maes lost 

under every disappointment in this country i 
feel i have still an unfailing resource in the truth 
inquiring spirit of germany and i do not despair 
of a patient hearing from its philosophers ever 



iv preface 



though i do not bow the neck to their metaphysical 
baals and molochs and may appear before them 
with the disadvantage of having been rejected by 
the sanctimonious worshippers of the golden calf 
at home the motto of germany is fiat justitia 
ruat ccelum and i therefore feel confident that 
if i have discovered any thing useful it will be 
accepted in a friendly spirit and gain an immediate 
hearing for its literary courts are always open 
its judges on their seats and it matters not whe 
ther the appellant be one of the sons of the father 
land or a barbarian as he will in either case be 
judged impartially and obtain the same justice as 
a native of the soil even though he may have 
come like another anacharsis from the scythian 
wastes of france or england 

should any one be of opinion that the truths i 
have brought to light have been previously dis 
covered he should point out where the various 
topics have been discussed with system or investi 
gated with the exactness and fulness they deserve 
he should remember that in this instance as in 
many others of human knowledge the remark of 
solomon must from the greater age and activity of 
the world gain fresh strength every day if it 
were true in his time that there is nothing new 
under the sun it must be much more so after the 



preface v 

lapse of two thousand five hundred years and 
during a period that has been stored by the inven 
tion of printing with the memorials of other men s 
thoughts to an extent that would have formed at 
least one exception to the remark of that wise 
monarch 

the mention of solomon s name recalls to my 
mind a story relating to him that is current among 
mahomedan nations and which i think will help 
to illustrate the design of the following observa 
tions pious moslems are of opinion that much 
of the glory of the hebrew sovereign s reign re 
sulted from the great ability and skill of his prime 
minister asaph whose knowledge of the occult 
sciences was so profound that it enabled him to 
control the gins genii a race remarkable for their 
stupidity and malevolence the fear these beings 
had of asaph was such that during his lifetime 
they refrained from every act of annoyance to man 
kind solomon however was resolved that his 
subjects should continue to benefit by the terror 
which his vizier had inspired and on asaph s 
death he had him embalmed and then placed in the 
treasury where he was dressed and set up resting 
on his staff the gins who were ignorant of his 
death stole from time to time to the treasury and 
peeped in slyly at the window to see what their 



vi preface 

tyrant was about when observing him always in a 
vigilant attitude they invariably fled lest he should 
punish them for their impertinent audacity in 
this state of ignorance they remained for a long 
time but at last it happened that some white 
ants so well known in the east for their destructive 
ravages found their way into the treasury and 
attacking asaph s staff he fell upon the ground 
upon which the gins finding out the trick that had 
been practised upon them began to vex and 
harass the human race as they had been in the 
habit of doing before now reader what is the 
whole host of metaphysicians that have formerly 
existed but so many asaphs merely preserved for 
the purpose of imposing upon mankind and what 
are all their abstract words but the staves upon 
which they rested their arguments while living 
and which still continue to prop up their systems 
now they are dead and finally what are these 
few pages but so many white ants that will i trust 
destroy their props and let those arch deceivers fall 
to the earth never to be set up again as bugbears 
to our race 

to the judicious sentiment of locke which is 
contained in the reflection placed at the head of 
the following remarks i wish to draw the reader s 
particular attention because it is not merely most 



prepack vll 

just but occurring as it does at the close of his 
great work it seems to have loomed upon his mind 
as the consummation of all his speculations and 
even to be a condemnation of the work itself or at 
least to intimate that he had arrived at a convic 
tion that language itself was the parent of much of 
the error it was employed to expose the opinion 
therefore of so masterly a mind is worthy of the 
highest consideration and i have accordingly given 
it its present conspicuous place for though it ap 
pears exactly shaped to suit the following observa 
tions it did not present itself to me till after they 
were written and the same remark applies equally 
to the quotation with which this work concludes 

having been long engaged on a work which is 
intended to demonstrate the necessary connexion 
relation and dependence of physics metaphysics 
and morals i found the whole of these topics a 
perfect chaos from the deceptive character of lan 
guage and i felt accordingly that there was no 
chance of giving a profitable direction to my labour 
without bestowing a thorough consideration upon 
that indispensable instrument of thought the 
following remarks were accordingly written by way 
of preliminary observations as it may be some 
time before that work is ready i have thought it 
as well to send forth this little messenger to ascer 



vlll preface 

tain what degree of chance exists for its meeting 
with a favourable reception it is my hope that i 
shall be able to lead the reader 

 through nature up to nature s god 

and bring home to him with irresistible convic 
tion the inconsistencies and absurdities of mate 
rialism with this view i have laboured to clear 
away the rubbish that has been heaped up so high 
from antiquity to the present time as scarcely to 
allow us more than a glimpse of truth berkeley 
has well said that we first raise a dust and then 
complain we cannot see but he neglected to analyse 
the nature of this dust or mankind would have 
been in possession of the means of laying it when 
ever it clouded their vision 

should any unforeseen circumstance prevent the 
accomplishment of my entire plan i feel i shall not 
have lived in vain if the completion of this portion 
of it shall help to liberate the human understand 
ing from some of its strongest bonds of selfdelusion 
and absurdity

reflection 



 the consideration then of ideas and words as the great instru 
ments of knowledge makes no despicable part of their contemplation 
who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole extent 
of it and perhaps if they were distinctly weighed and duly con 
sidered they would afford us another sort of logic and critic than 
what we have been hitherto acquainted with 

lockk s essay concerning human understanding 
book iv ch xx 



gen kkar note 



the following disquisitions are strictly confined to the objective 
view of nature 




introduction 

 were we to hear of an astronomer who should 
place full reliance on his observation of the stars 
though he had never verified his instruments nor 
depended for their verification on a competent 
assistant we should not merely be extremely sur 
prised but reject with contempt the results of his 
labours nay sensible men would even require that 
a scientific observer should be well acquainted with 
the principle upon which such instruments were 
constructed and assure himself that no possible 
cause of error lay in so essential a point but if we 
are thus particular in the means of obtaining accu 
racy in the results of physical inquiries it is strange 
that we are so indifferent and negligent in the 
examination and verification of the only instrument 
we can employ in philosophical inquiry that is in 
ascertaining the value and scope of the words we 
reason with the cause is simply i believe that 
as we have employed language by rote from infancy 
upwards and have always depended upon it in the 
common routine business of life we are led on 
gradually to use it in higher matters till at last we 
place such reliance upon it that we should almost 

b 



 introduction 

be considered insane to doubt its general accuracy 
it is my object however to show that partly from 
disdain for such investigations and partly from their 
supposed difficulty we have proceeded in a round 
of error till at last we have by our neglect arrived 
at conclusions so irreconcileable with common sense 
that the mass of mankind regard with something of 
scorn the aerial castles of metaphysics and if the 
labours of the mathematician meet with better suc 
cess we must rather attribute it to the certainty 
that attends his calculations when the data are right 
than to any means he possesses of avoiding error in 
his reasoning it will be found however as might 
be expected that the moment he theorizes he falls 
into the same inconsistencies as the metaphysician 
the analytic chemist too will be seen to be in greater 
difficulties than the mathematician whenever he 
attempts to reason on the invaluable facts his experi 
ments and acumen bring to light inasmuch as he 
has to account for the most mysterious results in 
words which are to him only so many counters of 
which he has not previously fixed either the relative 
or absolute value we have acted with regard to 
language as the alchymists did with respect to mi 
neral productions we have made use of it in a gross 
way and if we have been able to make any dis 
coveries in philosophy by its help it is more owing 
to chance than system but i believe that if we 
imitate the chemists of our own times we shall arrive 



introduction f 

at results altogether new and unexpected it is 
only by analysis that we can hope to discover truth 
and it is solely by that process that chemistry has 
taken its station as an exact science next in order 
to astronomy 

 i trust i shall be able to render intelligible 
to every person of ordinary education and capacity 
what i feel to be of such great importance the 
truth has been often seen by glimpses but i am 
not aware that any one has undertaken to give a 
definite and comprehensive view of the subject 
and far less has any one attempted to solve the 
enigma easy as i believe it to be it is therefore 
my intention to make language give evidence against 
itself and render up its secret to compel it to 
confess the manifold impositions it practises on the 
human understanding and to acknowledge that 
notwithstanding all its disguises and its supposed 
riches every word may be shown to mean nothing 
more than thing or state and that even the last 
of these two terms is a mere sound a symbol 
boldly invented by the intellect for the purpose of 
reasoning i shall enter upon the consideration of 
these two classes of words after a few preliminary 
remarks 

 the term intellect is uniformly employed throughout these 
pages for the thinking agent or self see the remarks on the 
intellect 



g introduction 

 all words are but of two kinds to which 
the terms concrete and abstract have been given 
the first class comprehends the names of all objects 
that come under the cognisance of one or more of 
the five senses that is all which we can taste touch 
smell hear or see whatever therefore is not to be 
distinguished by any of our senses nor derived by 
indubitable inference such as god soul and 
power is called abstract this subdivision points 
out with accuracy the mode in which this investiga 
tion should be pursued and i shall accordingly 
commence with the consideration of concrete terms 
or those words which designate real things that is 
things perceived by the senses and those we de 
rive by indubitable inference it might at first ap 
pear that the expression concrete and abstract 
having a scholastic air might be altogether replaced 
with advantage by conceptions and perceptions the 
latter having the great advantage of being referrible 
by our intelligence to the verbs to conceive and to 
perceive but though these are undoubtedly better 

 i limit the word concrete here to nouns that imply the names 
of real things and i except for my present purpose all adjectives 
yet i believe the whole of this class of words not derived from 
verbs to have been originally the names of things just as we now 
employ rose pink copper c for the names of colours 

 for the peculiar sense in which the word power is here 
employed see 

 the reader will find in the reason why i have not in 
this place alluded to ideas 



introduction 



for all familiar purposes the former are not without 
their use as being more comprehensive for in 
stance under concrete we can include both what 
we perceive and what we infer as being both ma 
terial and immaterial such as bodies as well as 
god soul or power but this cannot be said of 
perception yet if we make this exception we 
shall find perception and conception the more use 
ful and significant terms and i shall therefore gene 
rally use them from preference throughout this 
work as the point of view in which these two sets 
of terms are employed is quite different we shall 
find that if we attempt to include such immaterial 
things as god soul or power under perceptions or 
conceptions it must be under the last as they are 
only discovered by inference for all inferences 
phrases opinions conjectures notions proposi 
tions statements arguments c are strictly 
conceptions it is therefore worthy of remark 
that the term conception has here the advantage 
over that of abstract terms and thus more than 
balances that possessed by concrete terms over per 
ception both sets of terms will therefore be found 
occasionally preferable the one to the other con 
ception admirably represents both abstract terms 
as well as the inferences phrases opinions c 
which have been just enumerated in short every 
tiling we have already heard or conceived of our 
selves by the means of language and which are trea 



introduction 



sured up by memory a proof how much of the 
highest intelligence depends upon this faculty which 
is the very basis of thought and without the posses 
sion of which in a high degree no man can shine as 
a just and profound reasoner an examination 
indeed of the most original productions of the 
human mind will show how much they are depen 
dent upon preconceptions and if this is the case 
with them the discourses of ordinary minds will 
appear to be little more than parrotlike repetitions 
slightly modified for the occasion 

s see the note to 



of things 

 i have already said that concrete terms 
relate solely to what is made known to us by our 
senses or by indubitable inference but besides 
these there are many sensations which we are 
almost invariably in the habit of mistaking for the 
things which produce them thus the sensation 
of heat is commonly mistaken for the something 
which excites it and this is fully felt and acknow 
ledged by chemists and other writers on natural 
philosophy who have consequently been obliged to 
introduce the word caloric to prevent the confusion 
of thought that must follow from the use of the 
word heat in two opposite senses but no one ap 
pears to suspect that the same kind of mistake is 
made with regard to light though such is the fact 
all the beautiful illumination seeming to be caused 
throughout nature by the sun is but a sensation 
and if there were no eyes in the world every thing 
would be dark yet that which produced the sensa 
tion of light in us would still remain when we 
say we see a light or a flame or a colour we make 
the same mistake as the person who thinks heat and 
caloric to be one and the same thing so does he 
who supposes that what makes the air vibrate is the 



 of things 

sound he hears and he who thinks that the odour 
he smells is identical with that which passed from 
the flower he holds in his hand or that the taste he 
relishes so much is in the morsel he is pressing 
against his palate falls into a similar error these 
subjects are merely alluded to here that the reader 
may not commit the mistake of classifying under 
concrete terms what are really abstract for 
sights tastes smells sounds and feelings are all 
abstract terms and the things that produce these 
effects on our senses whether they be material 
or immaterial are alone represented by concrete 
terms this is as much as i believe it is necessary 
to say on the subject of what is concrete and i 
shall therefore proceed to the next division of the 
inquiry namely to abstract terms which are all 
included under the word state 



of states 

 every abstract word implies either a state 
or an action thus goodness is the state of a man 
who is goocl that is a goodmart sstate and vibration 
and movement are actions of bodies which vibrate 
and move if any one wished to generalize further 
he might say that all abstract words imply a state 
for we can speak of a state of action and so talk of 
the state of vibration or the state of movement of 
a body still the distinction will be found to be use 
ful in practice as will be seen when i show what 
abstract words are in reality but i must first recal 
the reader s attention to the way he has been in the 
habit of employing them he will remember that 
he talks of goodness virtue and other abstract states 
as something as palpable as the class of concrete 
words already alluded to and he accordingly says 
when occasion requires in goodness from goodness 
by goodness c just as he would employ in from 
by c in speaking of a house or any other tangible 
object though i shall shortly prove to him that this 
indispensable and necessary use of language in the 
common business of life is the root of the most 
glaring fallacies when we have occasion to reason on 
the fundamental principles of things in general 



 of states 

 having thus far introduced the reader to 
this branch of the inquiry i wish to inform him 
that it is my intention to show that though we can 
talk of goodness virtue blackness whiteness c we 
cannot think of them if any one will take such a 
word as goodness and decompose it he will find it 
to contain good and ness if he will do the same 
for other compound words implying a state he 
will always find that he has an adjective and an 
unmeaning termination in a similar manner any 
word implying an action such as movement may be 
reduced to the verb move and to ment a syllable of 
no sense hence it is clear that any word implying 
a state is derived from an adjective or a verb neu 
ter and every one signifying an action from a verb 
active nearly every word in english ending in 
tion is derived from a latin verb and the termina 
tion tio which is void of sense we thus see that 

 the apparent significancy of such terminations as ness ship 
hood head c will if they are referred back to their original forms 
be found to be quite delusive for instance ship does not mean a ves 
sel nor head the upper part of the body and so of the rest see this 
subject further pursued in note a 

 some will perhaps prefer restricting the termination to io in 
stead of tio as the abstract nouns formed with this affix always incline 
in their formation to that of the past participle and not to the present 
tense for example secretio actio c are more connected with se 
cretus actus c than with secerno ago c the reader can choose 
which form he likes best my object on the present occasion is not 
with etymology but simply the elucidation of a general principle of 
language for which i endeavour to find the readiest means 



of states 

these states and actions have no existence except 
as words and consequently that there are no such 
things as abstract ideas but only abstract words 
did abstract ideas exist in the mind before such 
terms were brought into use we must equally admit 
that it had in it the ideas of saltness sandiness 
sponginess ropiness and similar words before we 
knew of salt sand sponge rope or any other thing 
we may in time discover or fabricate should this 
assertion that we only employ abstract words and 
have no abstract ideas create a doubt let any one 
try to form to himself the idea of saltness sandiness 
sponginess or ropiness without any reference to salt 
sand sponge or rope and if he still fancy that he 
can let him try to conceive the idea or image of 
these qualities without calling to mind the sounds 
that express them or the things from which they 
have been abstracted he will i believe discover 
this to be impossible and to prove that there is 
no fallacy at the bottom of the assertion let him 
by way of contrast try to call to mind a house a 
horse a dog or any other object that has been made 
known to him by one or more of his senses and let 
him do this without any reference to the names 
they bear in his own or in any other language and 
he will i think find that he can do it without any 
difficulty his dreams too may be called in to 
the proof of this fact in them he sees and feels 
such things as he may have seen and felt in his 



ii of states 

waking moments but his abstract ideas have dis 
appeared though no one will deny but that it is 
quite possible to dream of salt sand a sponge a 
rope c it is no doubt very startling to have this 
fact brought home to us perhaps for the first time 
nor can such a rooted prejudice that is an opinion 
founded before judgment has been exerted be at 
once eradicated from our minds but it is only ne 
nessary for any one to consider it with the attention 
it merits and he will not fail however liable he 
must be from habit to continual relapses to feel 
its full force 

 let the reader therefore never forget that 
all abstract terms must come under the same law 
as saltness sandiness sponginess ropiness c and 
that if these must be admitted to have arisen after 
the knowledge of salt sand sponge rope c so 
must all others be equally dependent upon the 
knowledge of some previous concrete thing to 
which ness ship hood c have merely been added 
those therefore who hold out for abstract terms 
that is who are realists must be prepared to de 
fend saltness sandiness c or to surrender up 
every abstract word employed in language for 
they must one and all stand or fall together and 
this fact must never be lost sight of throughout the 
following remarks 



of states 

 as to such simple words as cannot be de 
compounded they will be found to be either adjec 
tives used nominally as a good a white c or they 
are verbs such as a run a knock a jump when 
such words are brought into use by convention 
they are understood with the greatest facility in 
their new character for if the language possess an 
article the placing of it before any term is a signal 
to the understanding of the new office the word is 
meant to fill and if it have not this defining par 
ticle the prefixing a possessive pronoun or a noun 
in the genitive case will at once cause the mind to 
class the word with other nouns as in such ex 
amples as his run his knock his jump c or a 
man s run a man s knock c by this process any 
verb may be converted into a noun as we see in 
such expressions as msfiat ms facsimile c and 
the intention of the speaker is comprehended even 
by a child at the very first employment of such 
terms a fact that throws some light on the faci 
lity with which we comprehend forms of speech 
we may not have heard before analogy being in 
all such cases the leadingstring of the understand 
ing but it may be objected that there is in en 
glish and perhaps in most other languages many 
words which cannot be either decompounded or 
traced to their originals this is undoubtedly 
true but they will be found to be words of the 
first necessity in language and for which the com 



 

pound form can be generally substituted as in the 
case of heat and hotness in our own language and 
of vita and vitalitas in latin but though we are 
now unable to trace such words to their remote 
etymons their existence can in no way impugn the 
force of the observations already made for the 
demonstrative clearness of the real nature of such 
as we can trace leaves no doubt respecting those 
of the same class which are obscure 

 it must be evident that in all the foregoing 
examples and also in all others that can be pro 
duced we might with equal certainty of being 
understood particularly after a little use have sub 
stituted the word state and thus have got rid of the 
whole multitude of abstract words and instead of 
speaking of goodness virtue vibration movement c 
have talked of the goodstate the virtuousstate the 
vibratingstate the moving state c had this been 
so we could not have been deceived as we now 
are for whenever we made use of the latter expres 
sions we should never have been led into the error 
of supposing such words as goodness virtue vibra 
tion movement c as having a real existence which 

 the reader will observe that it would be as unnecessary as 
incorrect to subjoin the word action to an active verb and to speak 
of the vibrating action here the generic term state is the right word 
but if we substitute vibratory for vibrating that is the adjective for 
the participle we may then speak of the vibratory action because 
no adjective contains in itself any reference to action 



of states 

is the case at present with all reasoners and even 
with myself as often as i speak without calling my 
mind by an effort to the consciousness of this fact 
one decided advantage which must have resulted 
from this last and more philosophical employment 
of the forms of speech would have been that where 
we spoke of the goodstate the virtuousstate the 
vibrating state the movingstate c we must in every 
instance have referred these states to some individual 
or to a body in which they were conceived to exist 
but as it is we make real and independent entities 
of these abstract words and they are as much a 
stumblingblock to the right use of reason when 
their real nature is not remembered as were the 
quiddities of the schoolmen but here arises the 
obvious and important question namely if all 
abstract words can be traced up to be the state of 
some thing how did mankind arrive at the word 
state or such other terminations significant or 
otherwise that are its equivalent for state in our 
language is the generic term for actions acts results 
relations qualities properties offices c to this 
the answer is that the reason has already been partly 
given in what has been said of the manner in which 
any word can be instantly made to pass for a noun 
by prefixing an article definite or indefinite to it 
or by employing a possessive pronoun or its equi 
valent a noun in the genitive case this however 
only shows hoiv we are enabled by analogy to refer 

c 



 of states 

all other abstractions to a class already established 
but does not explain by what process the mind came 
originally to use an abstract term this part of the 
question therefore deserves to be treated more fully 

 if we attentively consider language we 
shall find that without the aid of abstract terms 
we could never carry on a connected chain of rea 
soning children who in general up to the age of 
eight or ten are extremely sparing in the use of 
such words are not capable of reasoning at any 
great length and their longest discourses are con 
fined to narrations among all races of men that 
we know of at present abstract words are in use 
but of course much more sparingly in proportion 
as their minds are less cultivated hence we see that 
it is a universal principle of our nature to have 
recourse to their aid indeed we should be but as 
little children in thought without them i have 
already shown that it is by analogy that we class 
any new abstract term with those we had previously 
acquired it was by the very same process that we 
classed the first abstract nouns with those that are 
concrete this was one of the noblest steps in 
language for which it effected what the invention 
of algebra did for the science of numbers but 
while it gave man an almost unlimited power in 
reasoning on common subjects it led him into the 
grossest errors as soon as he began to reflect on the 



of states 

nature of the things he supposed to be represented 
by those very abstractions 

 the term state we have received from the 
latin language in which it and a very large class 
of similar words have the same termination in the 
nominative case as the past participle thus in the 
saxon portion of our language past participles are 
used as abstract nouns as for instance the word 
stroke derived from to strike so in french dcstinee 
is a past participle employed for the modern notion 
of fate it is therefore evident from the universality 
of such substitutions that we are driven to their use 
by the very frame of our intellect but when we have 
traced every abstraction to a state and being unable 
to go higher demand of ourselves what we under 
stand by the term we shall be brought to see how 
mysterious the nature of language really is and with 
what a delicate tact we must pursue the inquiry if 
we hope to arrive at a just conclusion in latin 
the word status must from its derivation have ori 
ginally implied a standing or station and in greek 
stasis is not merely synonymous with the english 
and latin but the three languages all derive the 
word from roots of common origin meaning to 
stand in the cognate and copious sanscrit the 
word sthitis might by its derivation be expected to 
express the same meaning but it is rather used in 



c 



 of states 

that language with the sense of stay staying c 
and for the signification of state in its abstract sense 
the word bhavas implying existence nature derived 
from the root bhu meaning being or to be is pre 
ferred in the arabic language state is expressed 
by the term hal which originally meant a turn 
being derived from haw ala it revolved 

 if we consider the foregoing words with 
attention we must be convinced that of them all 
bhavas is not merely the best but the only one 
which is the philosophical representative of what 
nature intended for if we ask ourselves what is the 
real sense of state in such phrases as the state of 
things the state of action sic we must feel that 
we mean the existence beingness of things or 
action here again we are compelled to ask our 
selves what is intended by existence and then we 
find we have got to the utmost bounds of human 
thought and that existence implies the state of 
that which is an answer completely in a circle 
that demonstrates that we can go no further it is 
obvious that that which is is nothing more than 
what is made known to us by sense namely 
existence that is to say visible nature now it is 
impossible that man in his primitive condition 
could have felt the force of these conclusions and 
that too before he had the very instrument with 
which he could have arrived at them namely 



of states 

language this inevitable inference must convince 
us that we must look to some other reason that 
will account for the universality with which such 
terminations as are the representatives of state 
namely ship hood ness c have been brought 
into use previously however to entering on this 
point it must be remembered that the word state 
which they all represent is itself a mere fiction for 
though we can think of something standing or that 
has stood yet the use of either of these two expres 
sions or of state as a reality is merely a bold and 
daring assumption of the intellect this is the 
grand point to which i wish to draw the reader s 
particular consideration nor can i hope that any 
thing i have said or have to say will be compre 
hended in its true light till he has mastered this 
point for though i may possibly be able to supply 
him with food for his thoughts the profitable nou 
rishment of his mind must depend upon his own 
efforts and the degree of attention which he bestows 
on what he reads to borrow an expression 
employed by tyros in euclid the present is the 
asses bridge of metaphysics and every exertion 
should be made to pass over it cleverly however 
uninviting it may appear at first sight let him 
reflect therefore that the understanding being defi 
cient in what would enable it to reason fluently and 
feeling itself arrested in its course by the want of 
something that should correspond to the real things 



 of states 

in nature made known to it through the senses is 
led by the very frame of the intellect to make this 
jump the necessity of which is abundantly proved 
by the fact that the same effort has been made by 
mankind in every condition in which they have been 
found that they might be able to say in a fright in 
a hurry c as they would in a field in a house c 
this otherwise inexplicable fact points out to us in 
conjunction with what i have already said that the 
terminations ship hood ness c as well as their 
corresponding representatives in other languages 
never did mean state or existence and that if they 
ever had any meaning at all it was entirely super 
seded by the new use to which they were applied 
that this is highly probable is evidenced by the 
circumstance that those words which are derived 
from verbs such as sleep anger love c all contain 
covertly to our understandings the force of state 
for we can in each case substitute for them the 
sleepingstate the angrystate the lovingstate c 
without the least danger of being misunderstood 
and that too though the form of expression is not 
usual if therefore as i have said these termina 
tions never did mean that for which they now alone 
stand it is the nature of our intellect that leads us 
by a sort of instinct to their use just as the nature 

 in the chinese language position determines the office any word 
is to fill an abstract word therefore is merely known by the place 
it holds in the sentence 



of states 



of the equally helpless infant guides it unconsciously 
to seek for nutriment from the mother s breast 

 having done all i can to explain the nature 
of the word state which is the very basis of all 
abstract language i now proceed to make a 
few remarks on the consequences that result from 
language being both simple and abstract and 
which fact having been quite overlooked or neg 
lected has given rise to the grossest errors even 
among the most profound thinkers the world has 
ever produced 

 all language then has two forms of expres 
sion the one simple the other abstract children 
always employ the first and those who reason much 
almost invariably the last if it be possible to do so 
thus a child would say alexander is good but the 
abstract reasoner in all probability would praise 
the goodness of alexander there is scarcely a short 
proposition that cannot be expressed in concrete as 
well as in abstract language but it would be 
impossible to put together a sentence of a few lines 
without some direct or covert use of abstractions 
even the words when where how c are only ellipti 
cal forms of phrases in which an abstraction exists 
where means in what place when in what time 
how may mean what degree manner reason cause or 
means and the same remark may be applied to all 



 of states 

 

other adverbs language has made considerable ad 
vances to perfection before such words as when where 
c are made the representatives of phrases the 
reader will now remember that there are two modes 
in which he may express himself namely the simple 
one of children and the more abstruse one of dialec 
ticians both are more or less used on all occasions 
however by every one and if every author s style 
were analysed according to this division it would 
afford a singular appearance of incongruity but 
the most remarkable circumstance is that the com 
bination of the two produces a singular confusion 
and jumble in our reasonings and is the fruitful 
source of error as will be evident by referring to the 
passages quoted from algazel and hume in 
 even the sagacity of newton committed 
the same mistake for when he accounted for the 
reflection of light by supposing that its particles 
were reflected bent back from their direct line 
by attractive and repulsive forces which he con 
ceived to reside in all material bodies and a little 
beyond their surfaces he fell into the common error 
of mixing that which is concrete light and abstrac 
tions forces together had any one asked this 
most cautious of philosophers what he meant by 
these attractive and repulsive forces newton would 
at once have felt that he had turned mere states of 
being into realities and had thereby begged the 
whole question that the same is done by all other 



of states 



mathematicians will not therefore excite surprise 
see 

 the main object of this inquiry is to show 
that we ought to learn to put their just value on 
abstractions but never to forget that they are but 
terms and that to fully comprehend what they 
really are we must become like little children in 
the use of language and restore every abstract 
expression we are desirous to analyse and under 
stand into that form in which a child would employ 
it thus when we speak of cohesion vibration c 
we must refer them to the things in which they alone 
have an existence namely to bodies solid fluid or 
aeriform and then we shall discover that all we can 
say is that bodies cohere vibrate c but as for 
those creations of our fancy called cohesion vibration 
c they have no existence except as sounds and 
have been solely brought into use that we might not 
be arrested in our course of reasoning but be able 
to say by through with in cohesion vibration c 
just as we say by through with in a house field c 
it is by these most useful nonentities that we are 
enabled to make our discourse as it were of one 
piece but unhappily we have so far deceived our 
selves in so doing as to make that which refers to 
something real and that which though it puts on the 
mask of reality means nothing but by an unconscious 
and remote reference to the word from which it 



 of states 

is derived of precisely the same value these abs 
tractions serve the same purpose in thought that 
ciphers do in calculation they are but signs of a 
conventional value and bearing a given relation to 
one another which the intellect feels by a peculiar 
tact with which it is endowed and which consti 
tutes the thinking principle to assign the means 
by which it is enabled to do so is as impossible as 
to comprehend the nature of the memory by which 
such signs are preserved for its employment 

 in drawing the reader s attention so strongly 
to the question of abstract terms i do so from the 
conviction that nothing but a constant vigilance of 
mind can prevent us from being misled by what we 
have been accustomed to consider from the dawn of 
reason as something real and which is only incon 
venient as in the present case when we would raise 
the veil of nature and penetrate into her inmost 
sanctuary for such is the force of habit that the 
delusion of language in which we have been nursed 
from our infancy and which in fact from its univer 
sality being found in every class of men literary 
and illiterate and every state of society civilized 
and savage we may consider as one by which we 
were intended to be deluded and from which we 
can only release ourselves by an occasional effort of 
reflection such as i am anxious to effect on the pre 
sent occasion in the mind of the reader he ought 



of states 

therefore not to think this inquiry either useless or 
irksome as i shall have often to remind him of the 
necessity of bearing in mind the neglected truth it 
enforces arid he will be fully conscious of its value 
as he proceeds 

 when we ask ourselves what we mean by 
abstract terms it is clear that if we have not pre 
viously reflected on the subject it will require a little 
effort to discover that they must imply states of 
bodies but not any thing which we can handle or 
discover by the means of our senses again if we 
ask ourselves what are the states of bodies we must 
immediately perceive that they are forms of speech 
these forms of speech therefore which we call 
states relations qualities c could never have had 
any existence but for the aid of language either 
oral or written thus if we saw a white horse we 
could never separate or abstract from it the idea of 
colour all this we can do by the help of language 
and we can talk but not think of whiteness with 
out reference to any object whatever it is evident 
therefore that there is no such conception in the 
mind as that of whiteness or any other colour or 
quality separate from the image of some object in 
which it is found and that such words are merely 
symbols which we employ to reason with and that 
they are consequently simply conventional terms 
when therefore metaphysicians speak of abstract 



 of states 

ideas it is evident that they make use of a term 
that has no meaning because such words denote 
nothing that has any real existence if then we 
wish to have a definite notion in the place of what 
is called an abstract idea we must find the con 
crete image from which it is drawn or abstracted 
for instance to understand what is meant by white 
ness i think of a swan snow or some other object 
which is commonly white and i have then a clear 
conception of that colour but even then i cannot 
separate it from the thing with which it is conjoined 
and i consequently discover that every idea i have 
is one which to exist must have a concrete that is 
a real existence in nature and that when i talk of 
a general or abstract idea i do so in compliance 
with common usage for a general or abstract 
idea is the same as no idea at all to feel the im 
mense importance of this conclusion let us remem 
ber that when we speak of extension length breadth 
c which are commonly called abstract ideas to 
understand what they really designate we must call 
up the image of something that is extended broad 
and deep as a lake for instance now these words 
have by the foregoing reasoning no existence what 
ever not even mentally being mere symbols pre 
served by the memory for the purpose of reasoning 

 some may suppose that after the fierce dis 
cussions that raged among the schoolmen under 



of states 

the names of nominalists and realists which began 
at the commencement of the twelfth century and 
only terminated with the new subjects of difference 
that were engendered by the reformation it must 
be unnecessary to allude to a subject that has ceded 
to the general feeling that the realists were in error 
and that as a consequence all or nearly all are of 
the side of the nominalists and therefore believe 
that these abstract words have no reality in them 
selves could i believe that all those who laugh 
at the most glaring of the absurdities of the realists 
were truly nominalists and as such reasoned con 
sistently according to this opinion these remarks 
had doubtlessly been spared as unnecessary but 
i believe the matter of fact to be quite otherwise 
and that every man is by nature by practice and by 
habit a realist and for the truth of this assertion 
i appeal to the effect the foregoing remarks have 
produced in the reader be he a professed metaphy 
sician or merely a lover of metaphysical disquisition 
it is therefore with the view of correcting if possi 
ble this natural bias of the mind that i have taken 
the pains of making the matter as simple and clear 
as i can the nominalists including their leader 
roscellinus and their later advocate our country 
man william of ockham have left the subject still 
in dispute the general arguments for and against 
the belief of general ideas were insufficient to con 
vince either side a result think that could 



 of states 

hardly have followed had the nominalists attempted 
the analysis of the terms by which such ideas are 
supposed to be represented this effort would have 
been the eocperimentum crucis that would not merely 
have silenced their opponents but their doing so 
would have conferred a lasting benefit on philoso 
phical investigation they should have done with 
general ideas as saint thomas aquinas did with 
the dreadinspiring automaton of albert the great 
and with one blow have proved their artificial origin 
by laying open fheir internal structure this would 
have destroyed their magic influence for ever 
roscellinus though the first among the moderns to 
broach the notion seems to have come nearer the 
exact truth than ockham as he maintained with 
respect to the general ideas of genera and species 
that they were mere sounds flatus vocis by means of 
which we denoted the common qualities which we 
observe among the various individual objects but 
ockham considered that though they had not a 
subjective they had an objective existence in the 
soul but to have made the matter quite clear 
ockham and his followers should have shown what 
this mysterious process of abstraction is namely 
the manner in which such ideas are formed had 
he attempted this he would have been obliged to 
have substituted the word term for idea and thus

have put an end to the controversy he would 
only have had to show that such words as rope 
stone c might be altered into ropy stony c 
and by a further process of sublimation converted 
into ropiness stoniness c by the mere addition of 
the unmeaning syllable ness and thus have brought 
down what they called philosophy from her stilts 
to the level of the human understanding showing 
her to be little more than a shadow tricked out in 
the gorgeous apparel of highsounding but empty 
words 

 the realists would certainly have been 
thrown into great difficulties if science had anti 
cipated its course and appeared in their days with 
the generalizations divisions and subdivisions of 
modern times if they could not settle the ques 
tion whether a genus had a real existence or not 
what would they have said to the higher generali 
zation of genera into orders and of these again into 
the remoter one of classes but in all such dis 
putes the human intellect appears to be spellbound 
for a certain period and being unable to pass over 
the narrow circle it had marked out for its own 
activity is driven round and round without the 
possibility of making a single movement in advance 
till it is all at once set at liberty from its folly by 
some new absurdity which in its turn becomes the 
subject of those bitter contentions that seem neces

sary in human affairs to create that degree of in 
terest which shall prevent a stagnation of mind 
that classification is a purely artificial process 
would seem to be sufficiently obvious we be 
gin with the individual or variety as john fohi 
and obi among men for every individual is 
strictly a variety we ought then to class these 
into species as the bearded the beardless and the 
woollyheaded race we then see that they likewise 
have a certain general resemblance and we collect 
them together under the term genus which we call 
homo or man afterwards we find we can go 
beyond this for certain genera have a remote rela 
tionship so we connect them under the word order 
and call them primates and finally we carry our 
generalization to a climax by placing all these orders 
under a class to which we give the name of mamma 
lia the distribution of species into subspecies as 
is done in some cases is a proof that such classifica 
tion is not quite correct it seems to have been 
formed inversely to the true order that is by begin 
ning with the class and descending to individuals or 
particulars that which is now called a subspecies 
should have been species as the first generalization 
of individuals or varieties and what are called 
species should have been termed genera c it 
has been well remarked by an eloquent writer that

it is not language however complete that will ren 
der science perfect but science when it is com 
pletely constituted that will perfect language but 
with regard to the particular question of abstrac 
tion the reader must see that mankind are habi 
tually in error and that nothing but a careful 
effort can release us from its delusive influence 
were we to hear of any one who in summing up 
the figures that represent so many things apples 
for instance of which he was anxious to know the 
amount should so far delude himself as to suppose 
the figures were really apples we should be cer 
tainly warranted in pronouncing him insane what 
shall we say of ourselves however when we consi 
der mere sounds to be real things in the case 
i have just put the madman has really something 
before him which he merely mistakes but in our 
own case we cannot even assign the things that 
we think are represented by our sounds if we 
judge the man to be mad who should mistake the 
figures for the fruit they represent we must surely 
admit that we at the least are most unreflecting in 
supposing that the words which we employ merely 
as signs in reasoning are the representatives of 
things called ideas that never existed 

 i think i cannot produce a more appro 
priate specimen of the effects of realism on the 
most acute minds than will be found in the following

cause of time spontaneity merges into it nature 
and time therefore is not cause matter is spon 
taneity nature alone therefore is cause and 
there is no cause of nature this subtle reasoner 
never once suspected that time and spontaneity are 
mere abstractions and that in the use made of the 
former it is actually personified the instance is 
very valuable as it shows how deeply rooted and 
universal this fallacy is in the human mind and 
how much mankind have been deceived by lan

escaping from its delusions examples equally

these however have been dignified from the most 
ancient times as profound philosophy and though 
the novice in metaphysics is confounded when he 
looks into metaphysical works and feels reasonable 
doubts respecting such reasoning he naturally at 
tributes his imperfect comprehension of what seems 
so consistent to his ignorance or inaptitude for dis 
quisitions of so abstruse and recondite a nature 
the truth of this assertion will be rendered evident 
by the remarks made upon hume 

 the effect of realism on our minds in 
leading us to convert these airy nothings into enti 
ties cannot be more plainly exhibited than in the 
universal use of them as faculties of the mind 
thus we speak of our will our judgment our 
fancy our imagination our understanding c as 
realities that form part of our intellect though we 
can in truth only say that we that is our intellec

portance to be more than alluded to here and it 
will accordingly be more appropriately considered

they have likewise received the sanction of great

to those of some more fortunate rivals which are

of blindly following those who have themselves 
received their first notions in science without any 
effort of reflection and who think it enough that

 the atrocious conduct of calvin in causing

a protestant reformer who vindicated liberty of

of the truth of the foregoing remarks and leads to 
more than a suspicion that the toleration so ear

a pleading for exemption for himself and followers 
from fire and fagot the same germs are uni

taught is a good and holy cause the history of all 
ages will confirm this fact heretics were first

spirit of the gospel which inculcates peace on 
earth and goodwill toward men has been essentially 
served and benefitted by pursuits which have 
smoothed down the asperities of our nature and

their religious instructors as had forgotten that 
christianity is a religion which enjoins every man 
to love his neighbour as himself 

 if the abuse of abstract terms has a bane 
ful effect upon philosophical investigation we must 
never lose sight of their extreme value in the ordi 
nary use of reason here indeed it is impossible 
to be too grateful for their existence as they exalt 
man even above his own exalted nature giving him 
a sort of unlimited command over the past and in

almost as much above the rest of mankind as man 
is elevated above the brute but if the tendency 
to realism is one of the injurious consequences of 
using abstract terms it cannot but be admitted 
that the personifying such words is one of the finest 
resources of fiction here at least we are not mis 
led but enter willingly and consciously into the 
pleasing delusion not only are abstractions some 
of the choicest ornaments of poetry but when per 
sonified give it an animation and a movement that 
leads the understanding a willing captive to the in 
ventions of fancy its fascinating effects must have 
been felt by every lover of the muse and before 
i bring a few examples by way of illustration i 
must remind the reader of the celebrated opening 
of rasselas where a writer of remarkable gravity 
and severity has employed it in prose with the 
happiest effect in poetry it constitutes the riches 
of every language that by its genius admits of its 
existence though shakspeare has been sparing 
in this figure he may be quoted for some charming 
instances as when he says 

she never told her love 

but let concealment like a worm i the bud 

feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought 

and with a green and yellow melancholy 

she sat like patience on a monument

as an example of the aid which genius derives from 
this figure of speech

 collins s ode on the passions is too well 
known to require more after the instance just 
given than to be recalled to the reader s remem 
brance as affording one of the most complete and 
perfect instances in our own and perhaps in any 
language of the happy and vivifying effects of per 
sonification its use in allegory has often been had 
recourse to and the wellknown choice of her 
cules from the greek of the celebrated sophist

protagoras may be quoted as one of the most feli 
citous efforts of genius in prose composition di 
rected to a great moral end the poem of cupid 
and psyche by mrs tighe is a most delightful 
production abounding in such soft and tender 
graces as could only spring from the gentle and 
delicate mind of a female bunyan s pilgrim s 
progress as an allegory in prose exhibits what 
may be effected by the enthusiasm of untutored 
genius when it concentrates its efforts in solitude 
and works in the rich mine of the imagination 
the writer trusting solely to his native strength of 
intellect and to but one book which he had made 
the sole object of his waking thoughts during the 
most energetic period of a life that had been roused 
into activity by all the opposing elements of per 
secution and injustice has produced a work of such 
unrivalled merit in its class for originality and in 
vention as must make it a popular favourite as 
long as the english language is understood or its 
literature valued 

 it now remains only to say that all we have 
at any time to talk or think of may be summed up 
by the terms perceptions and conceptions to 
the first belong all objects we perceive when we 
see hear smell taste or touch to the last all the 
combinations relations and other states of the 
objects or things we perceive and of which we are 



of states 

enabled to think or conceive by the mysterious 
operations of the intellect aided by the almost 
equally mysterious mechanism of language which 
it had previously prepared by and for the process 
to which we give the name of thought to this 
last class must likewise be referred those essences 
which we derive by strict inference when we ob 
serve the design harmony and operations of 
nature such as god soul and power the two 
most general words in language must therefore be 
thing and state the first comprising every thing 
that is concrete and the second every term that 
is abstract or in short that can be included under 
the word state 

 the foregoing views demonstrate that all 
reasoning is effected solely by means of words 
either single or linked together in those chains 
which we call conceptions but that no single word 
state even not excepted can be a conception in any 
other sense than as a sound preserved by the me 
mory it must however not be forgotten that 
many single words are really compounds thus the 
word altitude altitudo is such being compounded 
of alti high and tudo state that is astate 



gt this rule will equally apply to other words derived from the 
latin ending in tude such as gratitude magnitude c as well as to 
all other abstractions for whatever may be their termination it 

imply 



 of states 

so likewise the terms came and effect are repre 
sentative signs of the conceptions that cause is 
that general state which necessarily includes in itself 
the notion of an effect and reciprocally that an 
effect is that general state which necessarily includes 
in itself the notion of a cause if any one is willing 
to extend this view and think that every abstract 
term may be considered as the abridged represen 
tative of a compound notion i will not differ with 
him he may say for instance that goodness or 
virtue implies the state of him who is good or vir 
tuous and vibration or movement the state of 
action of that which vibrates or moves indeed the 
consideration of the languages of america which 
are in that state which they must have assumed at 

imply state the words benevolence reverence prudence observation 
reflection will be sufficient to serve as examples the word transub 
stantiation implies the statkofsubstancetranscending appearance 
that is substance the state of which is really different from what it seems 
to be to the senses i beg the reader to bear in mind that my object 
is not as i have before intimated with etymology for instance 
when i say that the tude tudo of the foregoing words implies state 
i merely mean that this word state is the best our language affords for 
the purpose for i have already pointed out in that the sanscrit 
word bhavas meaning existence or being in general is its true repre 
sentative if effects therefore bear evidence of their causes it 
marks that the hindu mind had a just philosophical turn even 
in its infancy a fact demonstrated by the whole structure of the 
sanscrit language and certainly it is no small glory to this ancient 
race that theirs is perhaps the only language in which the prin 
ciple of abstraction is exactly expressed by the word that ought to 
be employed 



of states 

their birth as is proved by the uniformity of plan 
that reigns throughout them all however they may 
differ from one another in the sounds they employ 
would add very much to the belief that even con 
crete terms are but the elliptical forms of longer 
sentences that were employed to represent the most 
common objects of life all therefore that i mean 
to contend for is that while the concrete words 
house dog horse c may be changed or broken up 
into letters there still will be houses dogs horses 
c remaining in nature but that if we decompose 
the abstract terms goodness greatness whiteness 
c there will then remain nothing that they re 
presented for with them must likewise disappear 
by the same process the main word that is to say 
the word state in the examples just given and it 
consequently follows that if there were no lan 
guage there could be no conceptions in short 
abstractions may not inaptly be compared to those 
crazy potentates found in madhouses who assume 
all the airs and attributes of royalty without any 
subjects for their support and who hold their rule 
by an ideal title so these abstract terms when 
sifted have neither subject nor object which they 
represent and are indeed what roscellinus termed 
them mere sounds abstract terms therefore are 
accurately represented by the term conceptions 
which include as has been already stated all 



 of states 

the phrases inferences opinions conjectures no 
tions propositions assertions statements argu 
ments c we have already heard or conceived of 
ourselves by the means of language not the least 
remarkable circumstance that attends the considera 
tion of language is the fact that the limited capa 
city of children at a very tender age is sufficient 
for its attainment and even for its tolerably correct 
employment and that idiots are able to acquire it 
with sufficient facility so as to be no way embar 
rassed to explain themselves though some lan 
guages the basque for instance are extremely com 
plicated in their structure while parrots though 
highly intelligent are unable to do more than re 
peat by rote the sounds they imitate thus forming 
a striking distinction between man in his lowest 
and the brute in his highest state 

 it is worthy of remark that it is r as i said 
before by turning language against itself that we 
make it give evidence on its own nature and thereby 
unfold much of the mystery that veils its great 
parent the human intellect from an indistinct 
feeling of this truth it was that i said formerly 
that we must thoroughly comprehend the nature 
of this first offspring of the human mind before 
we can hope to arrive at any legitimate conclusion 
as to the laws that regulate the phenomena of mind 



of states 

itself the inference to be deduced from the 
preceding inquiry is as follows 

 whatever realty exists must occupy space 
and whatever does not do so is only a state that is 
a symbol invented for the purpose of reasoning 



 it a short inquiry into the nature of language prefixed to the 
author s dictionary of the bengali sanscrit and english languages 

 or in popular language whatever in not body or spirit is only 
a word 



of abstract general and particular 
terms 

 i now proceed to examine in detail those 
primary terms which metaphysicians have been 
in the habit of taking as selfevident truths and 
which form consequently the data and axioms of 
metaphysics but i must first make a few remarks 
on the distinction between abstract general and 
particular terms so little attention has been 
bestowed on the classification of the words with 
which we reason on the most important points 
that no distinction is commonly made between 
terms whether they are abstract general or 
particular yet this want of clearlydefined no 
tions on the subject must lead to much confusion 
in reasoning 

 it matters not whether a word imply a 
perception or a conception that is whether it be 
concrete or abstract it may in either case be ren 
dered general or particular general terms are 
consequently both concrete and abstract good 
ness gracefulness perfection c are abstract 
terms employed in a general sense and they 
may be equally used in a particular sense at plea 
sure thus we may speak of the goodness of the 



of abstract general and particular terms 

deity the gracefulness of a sivan the perfection of 
nature e and when we do so these words have 
then a general sense but when we say he has a 
goodness of heart peculiarly his own the swan has a 
gracefulness that belongs to no other aquatic bird 
nature has a perfection that art can never attain we 
must see that these words which are simply states 
of being can be rendered both general and par 
ticular in a similar manner the name of every 
particular material thing may be rendered general 
by either prefixing the definite article to it or by 
employing it in the plural we may speak indif 
ferently of the horse the dog the oak the diamond 
c or we may generalize by speaking of horses 
dogs oaks diamonds c indeed it appears to me 
that as often as we speak of any thing in an inde 
terminate or indefinite manner we still do no more 
than generalize and so the expressions a horse a 
dog an oak a diamond c have scarcely any dif 
ference from those with the definite article except 
that the figure is less noble and impressive the 
only exceptions in our language to the foregoing 
process of generalization is found in the words god 
and man neither of these can be rendered general 
by prefixing the the first is always rendered 
definite and particular by so doing as when we 
say the god of abraham isaac and jacob we can 
also prefix the definite article to the name of god 
as when we sav the almighty the omniscient or ttltgt 



 of states 

omnipotent god c which likewise it will be 
admitted have a particular and not a general sense 
when so employed there remains one mode of 
generalization to be yet explained which is more 
perfect perhaps than that afforded by preceding 
examples as when we substitute shipping for ships 
literature for letters cavalry for horsemen c thus 
leaving no doubt on the mind in what sense we are 
to understand such terms the reader however 
must not confound this common and natural use 
of language with the artificial abstractions and 
generalization of naturalists such as have been 
alluded to in 

 the object of the foregoing remarks is to 
convince the reader that every abstract term may 
be used either in a general or a particular sense 
and that every concrete word may be equally em 
ployed in the same way but he must carefully 
remember that though we speak of horses dogs 
c they have no more reality when employed 
in a general sense than is the case with abstract 
conceptions this caution is the more neces 
sary as the individual objects being real we are 
apt unconsciously to refer the general term to 
the particular object from which it is taken and so 
to mislead ourselves the distinction here pointed 
out that even a word that signifies something ma 
terial becomes a mere nonentity when employed 



of abstract general and particular terms 

in a general sense is of the highest importance as 
a help to the understanding in the comprehension 
of the nature of abstract terms the reader can 
not but feel that there can be no such thing as a 
general tree or any other object and that the 
word tree is therefore a mere sound and nothing 
more when used in such a general sense because 
it then refers neither to a particular oakash y fir or 
other tree now if this be so with what has real 
representatives how much less if the comparison 
be admissible must it be the case with what are 
merely abstract and which have no representatives 
in nature 

 having thus shown in treating of abstract 
and general terms that all the words implying 
states of being may be either considered under a 
general or a particular point of view it remains 
to say that when they are employed in the first of 
these divisions they are then used absolutely with 
out any reference to a contrast or comparison but 
when we speak of a particular state it may be con 
templated with reference to the same kind of state 
existing in a higher lower or equal degree in some 
other subject thus we can suppose that the ambi 
tion of alexander was greater than that of parmenio 
by the celebrated reply he made to the latter 
when darius proposed a division of the contested 
empire of persia but hen hie poet says 



of states 



 ambition first sprung from your blest abodes 
the glorious fault of angels and of gods 

it is evident that he has employed the word ambi 
tion in an absolute and general way free from all 
degrees of comparison as is clear from the omission 
of the article definite or indefinite the same may 
be said for the word fame in the following pas 
sage which differs from the sentiment contained 
in that just quoted 

 fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise 
that last infirmity of noble mind 
to scorn delight and live laborious days 

here the religious persuasions of milton have led 
him to undervalue one of the most ennobling motives 
to action that can exist in the human breast what 
is either ambition or the desire of fame but the 
love of notice exciting us to deserve the admiration 
and approbation of our fellowbeings and is such 
a universal passion evidently implanted in our 
bosoms by the hand of god himself to be called an 
infirmity this can only be said of its abuse and 
the same can be said if we allow any other feeling 
to obtain an undue ascendancy 

 the next step is to give the reader an 
opportunity of judging of those abstract terms 
that constitute the fundamental notions of meta 
physical reasoning and he should give his whole 



of abstract general and particular terms vgt 

attention to this most important subject as he will 
i am certain be quite convinced if he still should 
require any further proofs of the deceptive influence 
exerted by language in leading the understanding 
astray but he must never forget the result of what 
he has just read namely that 

 evert abstract term may be either general or 
particular and every general term may be either 
abstract or concrete but that a word which is abstract 
or general is nothing but a sound dependent for its 
existence merely upon language 



 

of entity and quiddity 

 there is a fortune among words similar to 
what we see amongst men some are destined to be 
long retained in favour whilst others are discarded 
never to be recalled again this is strikingly exem 
plified in the words entity and quiddity the first 
of these continues to be considered of unexcep 
tionable value but the last having been discounte 
nanced by locke has sunk into insignificance and 
even contempt entity implying beingsiate or 
beingness stands for any thing that is real and is 
certainly a harmless word as long as it is not made 
to pass for something real by its own nature quid 
dity derived from the quidditas of the schoolmen is 
deduced from quid what and therefore implies 
whatsfate or whatness though they used it for 
essence it being held by the realists among them 
that every abstract relation had a real essence 
through which it had its being but locke s rea 
sonings having shown the absurdity of the notion 
which indeed had been long questioned the word 
sank into complete disuse except occasionally to 
whet the wit of modern metaphysicians locke 
however seems to have been in a great measure a 
realist himself and his whole work on human 
understanding is built upon the belief in abstrac 
tions these two words are humourously alluded 
to by butler 



of entity and quiddity 

 he could define all acts 
and knew their natures and abstracts 
where entity and quiddity 
the ghosts of defunct bodies fly 

 the arabs would appear to have represented 
this word by mahiyat which is of very singular for 
mation being contrary to the general structure of 
their language it implies whatisitness in the 
sanscrit language the word tattwam meaning that 
state or thatness seems its exact representative 
these analogies are curious as showing the limited 
resources of the human mind and the similarity of its 
mode of proceeding under any difficulties it has to 
surmount quiddity and entity though they have 
now t parted company seem to have represented the 
essence and form which we occasionally hear con 
trasted with one another 

of habit habitude custom and use 
 these words are very commonly employed 
indifferently the one for the other if however ve 
discriminate we shall at once see that they are 
distinct in the notion the mind entertains of them 
and ought consequently not to be confounded toge 
ther when any act has been repeated a few times 
we perform it again unconsciously from habit 
habit therefore always produces an act of some kind 
or other if we repeat such acts frequently we 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

become from habit habituated or accustomed to 
them and habitude and custom consequently are the 
result of habit when however we are exposed to 
some inconvenience for a continuance we become 
less and less sensitive to its annoyance and we are 
at last so used to it that we become almost indifferent 
to its existence and even unconscious of it and 
we are then said to be reconciled to it from use 



of knowledge and wisdom 

 the words knowledge and wisdom are very 
often employed indiscriminately for one another 
they ought however to be carefully distinguished 
knowledge simply implies every thing we have 
learnt either by instruction observation or experi 
ence hence a man may be very knowing and very 
learned and still never be able to pass for a wise 
man to make a wise man it is necessary that he 
should have reflected upon what he has learnt for 
it is only through having considered any fact in its 
various points of view and in its relation to others 
to which it has an affinity that a man can be said to 
know it to any useful end it is solely by the same 
process that he arrives at those general conceptions 
that store his mind for every emergency and he 
who can only trust to what he remembers of other 
men s thoughts to supply him with the means of 
meeting any exigency will rarely find himself 



of knowledge and wisdom 

prepared to effect a happy result there is no man 
that is not wise in some things for every one has 
more or less reflected on what most nearly concerns 
himself but there are infinite degrees of wisdom 
generally speaking however it is only to the highest 
efforts of reflection that we give the name of wis 
dom indeed it seems from the force of realism to 
be taken in an absolute sense free from all compari 
son where it exists in a high degree it is felt to be 
something almost divine as in the instance when by 
the help of personification we speak of the voice of 
wisdom or as something real when we recall to 
mind the celebrated sentiment of antiquity wisdom 
is the sole imperishable possession in the well 
known and melancholy sentence where it is said 
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that 
mcreaseth knowledge mcreaseth sorrow we must 

 i opa juov twv ktijuqtwv aflaiarwv 

gt ecclks ch i ver in the hebrew original the first word igt 
the correct translation of hukmuli but the second would be more 
correctly rendered science which is the true meaning of duiith this 
passage is remarkable as being in direct opposition to the opinion ot 
cicero i t iui igitur essemus beati cognitione reram et scientiie 
frmj hortciix lte trinitatr as well as to the sentiment of virgil 

 felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas 

as to the sentiment itself it may probably have arisen from the 
difficulties attendant upon study and composition in those days 
of which some notion may be formed if it be true as is said that 
zoroaster committed his doctrines not to paperbut to cowhides 
on which he inscribed them with a knife but in these days when 
tin art of printing has made study so easy it is a different matter 
and it can be almost said that in vlw runs gt rwl 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

not suppose that wisdom and knowledge are placed 
purposely in contrast but that they are merely put 
in a sort of opposition for the sake of the diction a 
figure that is common in the hebrew language and 
to which the appellation of parallelism is applied 
knowledge must by its very nature consist in an 
acquaintance with particulars wisdom with gene 
ralities the first therefore is to be obtained as i 
have before said by instruction observation or 
experience but the last only by reflection the 
ancients were wise with comparatively little know 
ledge and the moderns are extremely knowing 
with very little wisdom those who devote them 
selves to study and observation have but little time 
and opportunity for reflection and the converse 
may be said with equal truth of those who are 
given to reflection the state of mind required for 
each is different and perhaps the kind of mind 
likewise after what i have said on the nature of 
abstract words it is hardly necessary to repeat that 
there is neither wisdom nor knowledge and that 
we can only say that such a man is wise or that he 
knows something more or less perfectly than some 
one else 

of principle 

 principle is a word in the mouth of every 
one and yet it is not perhaps always understood 



of principle j 

as exactly as its importance merits in morals it 
means those first notions which are the regulating 
points of all good conduct thus not to steal to 
lie c are all principles which it is the duty of 
every good man to obey when therefore any one s 
conduct is thus regulated we speak of him as being 
 a man of principle and when he sets the pri 
mary notions of morals at defiance we equally say 
u he is unprincipled principle therefore im 
plies a mind that has arrived at certain primary 
conceptions either by the means of instruction or 
by a spontaneous effort of reason or by both we 
must feel consequently that it is the pure offspring 
of reason and that its birth and value are only 
appreciated in proportion as its parent obtains 
dominion in the affairs of mankind and as its own 
offspring good conduct is duly respected even 
in subjects that do not relate to morals we find 
the word principle commonly employed because 
whatever is the object of reason must contain in 
itself some principle or leading notion thus every 
law and every argument must be referrible to a 
principle which is their guiding reason or they 
will be nothing but nonsense principle therefore 
though a mere word is one of singular importance 
as it is the polar star of the moral and intellectual 
man indeed among the various abstractions that 
have been deified it is singular that principle has 
been overlooked perhaps the reason is that it is 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

only found in languages that have arrived at a high 
perfection and that its value is consequently only 
felt in those advanced stages of civilization in which 
men are too wise to be so grossly duped by a mere 
word yet it is to it that the legislator must look 
as the buoy to which all actions must be moored 
and without which mankind will ever be at the 
mercy of the storms and hurricanes of their pas 
sions 

 principle is alone the true bond of society 
that binds every man firmly to his neighbour and 
enables him to reckon upon his word with the same 
certainty as upon another self when therefore 
communities possess this link in perfection which is 
stronger than any that could be formed of adamant 
they will arrive at a degree of internal strength and 
prosperity at present unknown but unfortunately in 
the hollowness and unsoundness that inevitably lurk 
in the rapid growth of civilization cupidity and lust 
but too often assume its appearance and then spread 
more ruin and misery than could flow from open 
hostility to this uncompromising safeguard of so 
ciety the importance therefore of principle can 
not be too early inculcated on the minds of child 
ren and even one conquest of self in the infantine 
period of life will be of inestimable advantage to the 
future man by giving the child a confidence in his 
own strength of mind that will grow with his 



of principle 



growth and which nothing can afterwards shake or 
weaken unhappily however the truth is quite 
overlooked by the generality of mothers in their 
blind admiration of their offspring expecting in 
their utter ignorance of human nature that good 
conduct must be the natural attendant upon what 
they are pleased to think so perfect and forgetting 
the profound injunction of solomon when he says 
 tram up a child in the way he should go and when 
he is old he will not depart from it if the mother 
therefore neglect to instil good principles the 
schoolmaster s efforts will be next to useless be 
cause bad habits are with difficulty eradicated and 
the future man will be but the enlargement of 
the child in mind and body and be it remem 
bered that a very slight incision made in the tender 
sapling becomes a yawning and unsightly defor 
mity in the fullgrown tree and must continue as 
long as it exists the stubborn oak too may by 
early training be made to retain any form into 
which it is bent moreover all education should be 
directed to meet the peculiar propensities of the 
individual the knowledge of which requires some 
degree of discernment the selfwilled and selfish 
libertine may be seen in the pampered pet of home 
and the remorseless villain is generally shadowed 
out in the cruel and apathetic brat nearly every 
instance of moral excellence may be traced to the 
mother s fostering care for she and not the father 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

is necessarily the child s companion guide and 
example 

 the word principle is often employed 
though perhaps without any necessity for an element 
in physics thus we speak at one moment of che 
mical principles and perhaps at the next of the 
principles of chemistry using the word principle 
in two opposite senses yet it appears to me to be 
a pity to employ this or any other term for more 
than one purpose as it cannot but lead to con 
fusion of thought and consequently to the produc 
tion of error like all other words that do not 
admit of an obvious analysis it fails to impress its 
own meaning on the mind of the hearer were 
we without it in our language we might supply its 
place equally well by such words as leading notion 
prime notion c in morals a principle and a 
rule appear to be alike but in reasoning the 
principle is as the soul and the rule as the body 
which it guides and enlightens when therefore 
we are doubtful of the intention of any rule or 
argument a reference to the principle upon which 
it has been constructed becomes the sole means 
by which we ascertain how either is to be under 
stood 



 

of fortune chance and providence 
 in all periods of the world and among all 
nations certain general words have been in current 
use to account for the events and vicissitudes of life 
in antiquity fortune played a great part and is still 
appealed to though it has ceased to be worshipped 
as a deity chance in the present times has the 
same office though when employed by one who 
believes in an intelligent ruler of nature it amounts 
to a contradiction of his own convictions of such 
words the most unexceptionable is providence for 
though an abstract term as it appeals to the fore 
sight of the deity it is only expressive by the 
reference it contains which is indeed so strong 
that the word is generally understood as represent 
ing the deity himself nor does it as in the 
former terms necessarily preclude the just infe 
rence of reason that every event must have had an 
immediate cause the observations i have made 
on fortune and chance might be extended to fate 
and destiny but i feel it is unnecessary to say 
any thing further on this subject 

of matter substance and body 

 these three words are often employed for 
one another without much attention to the peculiar 
force of each particularly when they are opposed 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

to spirit but contrasted with one another they have 
distinct senses matter is that general term which 
we employ when we speak of the substratum of 
things without any allusion to their peculiar na 
tures it is generally opposed to mind substance 
implies matter existing in some peculiar state or 
condition thus wood stone c are substances 
it may be opposed to essence body however refers 
distinctly to form and is made up of substance 
thus a tree a pebble c are bodies its oppo 
site is spirit though should soul be used it then 
relates exclusively to human kind it therefore 
follows that 

 matter is the substratum of substances and 
substance of bodies 

of nature 

 perhaps no word is used so frequently and 
so indiscriminately as nature nor is there one that 
leaves so many vague notions on the mind were 
we only to attend to such meanings of words as 
result from investigating their etymology nothing 
would be easier than such a process but words 
acquire distinct senses from their primitives by 
convention the term nature we have received 
from the latin through the french in its original 
language it belongs to a class of words which 



of nature 

imply the act of what the root signifies as well as 
the result of its action and which terminate in 
tura and ura such as structura pressura cesura 
c natura therefore as derived from nascor 
am born would seem to mean that which is bom or 
produced in greek nature is represented by the 
word qvffig which is formed from the verb ltpvu i 
bring forth or qvopau i am born and the termina 
tion fig that always expresses the state of whatever 
the root implies and in this case therefore means 
state of bringing forth or of being born but popularly 
nature birth growth c in the sanscrit lan 
guage nature is represented by the word prakritis 
derived from pra the same as the greek and latin 
pro and kri to make which seems to be the very 
original of the latin creo make while tis is the 
same as the greek ltrig just spoken of now as this 
termination always implies the result of the action 
or state of whatever the root may signify we must 
see that prakritis conveys the notion of foremake 
or that which was first formed that is to say nature 
in these words we must feel that nearly the very 
same sense is implied by all namely formation 
production c however different the roots or lan 
guages may be from one another in which they 
exist such words as natura fivtrig and prakritis 
were all brought into use long before man began to 
reason on the mysteries of life and consequently 
required to be turned from their original meanings 

f 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

for the new purposes to which they were applied 
this was as inevitable as unfortunate mankind 
will do any thing with their old materials particu 
larly in the hurry of conversation or the heat of 
argument rather than make something new that 
would suit the occasion exactly and once em 
ployed a word is sure to be used again when the 
same necessity recurs and it is finally fixed in its 
new character by habit and convention this is 
always an unfortunate result in language for the 
multiplicity of meanings of any word is certain of 
introducing obscurity and vagueness in its employ 
ment and of this fact the variety of senses and 
the consequent confusion of thought that results 
from the use of the word nature is itself a sufficient 
proof 

 if we examine the various senses of the 
abstract word nature we shall find that they amount 
to about four in its original and common use but to 
these we must add one more when it is employed 
as it frequently is in a comprehensive sense the 
first and obvious signification of nature is that which 
implies appearance as when we say how lovely is 
nature on looking at any pleasing object such as a 
landscape a flower c the second sense is that of 
contrivance or disposition of parts as when we are 
impressed with the conviction of contrivance in the 
adaptation of animals and their organs to the pur 



of nature 

poses of their being thus we say it is the nature 
of a fox to be cunning of a cat to scratch when 
angry and of a dog to be affectionate so we say 
wings are fitted by their nature for flying and legs 
for walking the third sense in which nature is 
employed is that of materiality as when we ask the 
question of what nature is it meaning of what 
substance is it formed that is is it of wood stone 
shell c 

 the employment of nature as an agent 
which is its fourth sense could only be tolerated in 
those languages that admit of personification by the 
genius of their construction by this figure nature 
is represented as an agent busy in the production 
and support of this universal frame of being in this 
sense it is considered by some as an imaginary being 
but still a question fairly arises as to what extent 
mankind are justified in attributing agency in the 
phenomena beheld around them that there is 
agency in action no one can doubt and though 
they have borrowed a word that by its origin does 
not imply agency but its results their doing so 
cannot overturn the inference derived from their 
observation thus though the words for soul in 
sanscrit greek hebrew and arabic originally sig 
nified air or breath their having been thus turned 
aside from their original sense does not destroy the 
existence of the thiny they may represent more or 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

less aptly a ship has not the less a real existence 
because it is called a manofwar and so of any other 
thing it could not be expected in the infancy of 
society that a name for so subtile an agent should 
have been specifically invented for the occasion and 
in those languages which admit of personification 
its want was not felt as the multitude use personified 
words in a real sense and never doubt of their 
actual existence hence nature stood and conti 
nues to stand in their minds for a kind of beneficent 
being that is not merely the operative agent in the 
universe but lends her assistance as often as the cor 
poreal necessities of animated beings require her aid 
thus we say continually nature came to his assist 
ance nature made a great cure and we say with 
equal indifference either nature or instinct teaches 
the bird to make its nest c nature sometimes fails 
in her works and similar expressions 

 a fifth meaning may be assigned to nature 
as when we sum up all we can conceive under the 
expression god and nature in this last case the 
word has the collective sense of all the others and 

 these observations being written while absent from books of 
reference i have not been able to consult the large edition of 
dr johnson s dictionary where i remember he sums up from boyle s 
essay the various senses of the word nature they may however be 
acceptable to the reader as the result of independent thought they 
will however be given in the appendix note c with some re 
marks of my own 



of nature i 

implies appearance contrivance agency and ma 
teriality these are i believe all the principal 
senses of the word though undoubtedly others 
exist but the only one which really concerns the 
reader is that of agent 

 it may be interesting to compare these 
views with those which cicero puts into the mouth 
of balbus the stoic in his work on the nature of 
the gods 

 some think that nature is a certain irrational 
power exciting in bodies the necessary motions 
others that it is an intelligent power acting by 
order and method designing some end in every 
cause and always aiming at that end whose works 
express such skill as no art no hand can imitate 
for they say such is the virtue of its seed that 
however small it is it falls into a place proper for 
its reception and meets with matter conducive to its 
nourishment and increase it forms and produces 
every thing in its respective kind either vegetables 
which receive their nourishment from their roots 
or animals endowed with motion sense appetite 
and abilities to beget their likeness some apply 
the word nature to every thing as epicurus who 
acknowledges no cause but atoms a void and their 
accidents but when we the stoics say that na 
ture forms and governs the world we do not apply 

 translated by thomas fkanckun dl book ii gt 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

it to a clod of earth or a piece of stone whose parts 
have not the necessary cohesion but to a tree an 
animal in which there is not the appearance of 
chance but of order and a resemblance of art 

 the first signification of nature in this pas 
sage is just the equivalent of what is commonly 
called power as will appear in the following views 
in its next sense in which it is personified it 
approaches very near to that which we call provi 
dence and in the last it is employed very much 
in the general and arbitrary way we hear it used in 
familiar conversation 

of necessity 

 few w r ords have had a greater influence over 
the minds of men than that of necessity so much 
so that it might be almost considered to be supe 
rior to the deity himself by the help of realism 
it has been converted into a reality of the first im 
portance indeed it is not always clear whether 
the deity is not oftener controlled by necessity 
than obeyed put into plain english this mighty 
word means nothing more than unyielding or un 
ceasing state that is unyieldingness or unceasing 

 there is evidently some error in the original which commen 
tators have endeavoured in vain to clear up the context requires a 
word implying design or reason structure for instance as a clod or 
a piece of stone exhibit cohesion as much as vegetables or animals 



of necessity 



ness being derived through the french from the 
latin necessitas a word which in ancient mytho 
logy was personified as the mother of the fates 



of infinity 

 it has been shown in that abstrac 
tions must be referrible to some concrete term that 
has at least suggested the notion that led to their 
formation when however we ask ourselves what 
is the concrete thing that has suggested the notion 
of infinity that is of endless state or endlessness 
we can only reply if we dare venture so far that it 
is derived from what is infinite should it be again 
demanded of the person who might make such an 
answer what the thing is which is infinite he would 
be brought into great difficulty for he could not 
point out or produce any thing which is infinite 
he might possibly say that the universe is infinite 
but as he had never seen the whole of the universe 
he would fairly beg the question and fall into an 
absurdity at the same time for if it could be called 
a whole it would be definite and not indefinite 
which every thing infinite must be by the same 
reason that the moment a thing can be said to be 
definite it is finite either in number or quantity 
the notion of infinity therefore is a mere effect of 
those conceptions that depend upon our putting 
sounds together and is consequently a nonentity 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

for even in imagining a space to be succeeded by a 
space and that by another and so on we can never 
arrive at the notion of infinity and wherever we 
leave off though we have added one system of stars 
to another mentally we have at the best only 
reached even in imagination to what is finite but 
we can take the question up under another point of 
view that will leave us no room to doubt the fore 
going conclusions every thing of which the human 
intellect is cognisant can be considered as repre 
sentable by a definite number thus we must sup 
pose the number of the planets and satellites of our 
system to be of a certain definite amount be they 
thirty forty or whatsoever number any one might 
fix upon but if we were to assert that though they 
did not exceed fifty yet that they were indefinite 
because their number was unknown to us we should 
certainly be deemed insane for every one will 
allow that they must be equal to a certain number 
if they exist at all now what are we to think of 
the number of all the other heavenly bodies is it 
definite or indefinite he who shall answer that 
they are definite in number will then have tacitly 
admitted that they are not infinite and he who 
shall be of opinion that they are indefinite will 
have acknowledged that they have no existence 
here then is a dilemma from which we cannot 
escape and we shall arrive at a similar contradic 
tion between reason and sense as often as we push 



of infinity 

any question in nature to an extreme in every 
point of view therefore infinity is a mere sound 
we here see a ease that points out most clearly to 
us that the intellect is the helpless captive of a chain 
of words it has forged for its own use and which 
never can be permanently burst asunder since at 
the very moment that reason and reflection break a 
few of the links they reunite of themselves by the 
mere effect of habit with these very chains how 
ever man presumes to think he can measure and 
survey all things and in the war of words dares 
to strike down every adversary who from want of 
equal dexterity or opportunity has not been able to 
forge shackles for himself of equal weight and size 
so proud too is he of these bonds made by his own 
ingenuity that he looks down with sovereign con 
tempt upon those who are not equally encumbered 
and as the reward of the fallacies with which he 
has in his own conceit fortified his understanding 
he becomes the theme of admiration and idolatry 
with those who are in fact less benighted than him 
self and who are really his superiors inasmuch as 
they are conscious of the darkness in which all 
things are involved for to have no opinion is better 
than to have one that is false hobbes has remarked 
 as men abound in copiousness of language so they 
become more wise or more mad than ordinary 
from these observations it follows that 

 leviathan part i chap p 



i 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

 infinity is an abstraction abstracted from 
nothing and therefore a pure assumption suggested 
to us by sense and unsupported by reason 



of individuality 

 no question not even infinity itself has so 
much puzzled mankind as that of individuality the 
greater effort we make to gain a clear conception 
of its nature the more we feel bewildered nor can 
any exertion of the mind enable us to grasp the 
phantom that we propose for our comprehension 
it is in vain that we attempt to renew our efforts 
and to exert all the attention of which we are mas 
ters it absolutely escapes from us as we seem to 
approach it and yet maliciously to dance before 
us like some visionary spectre which the daydream 
of the maniac has conjured up for the purpose of 
tormenting its victim nor is it very difficult to 
assign the cause where we are seeking for a sub 
stance when there exists only a shadow in short 
for something where there is nothing but a sound 
as an abstraction individuality can have no exis 
tence and when we resolve it into its elements it 
simply implies individual a which state as i 
have shown being nothing more than a 
figment of the intellect we have of course been in 
pursuit of what is as unreal as the will o the wisp 
which misleads the benighted wanderer to keep 



of individuality 

our understandings therefore in a sane state let us 
always remember that though we can think of indi 
viduals we can only talk of individuality 

of relation abstract 

 my great object in the present work being 
not merely to make the mass of mankind think for 
themselves but to think justly the reader must bear 
with me if i occasionally split a subject to very 
rags in attempting to lay it open to the view of all 
there are many words that we are in the habit of 
using and which we employ with the nicest accuracy 
in reasoning by that delicate intellectual tact with 
which we are endowed through our organization yet 
of which if we were called upon at a moment s notice 
we could not give the slightest account the words 
quality and relation are two of these and indeed 
i may say i never met with any one but who even 
after exhibiting great talent in using them while 
discussing some metaphysical point seemed quite as 
if he was deprived of his understanding upon being 
suddenly asked what he conceived to be the nature 
of quality or relation for the obscurity of the 
first word there seems to be some excuse but this 
cannot be said to be the case with regard to rela 
tion for it clearly expresses the state of the things 
that we conceive to be related that is their related 
state or rehitedncss for instance i see a horse 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

and a man utterly unconnected with one another 
i can at once by an effort of my mind cause them 
to be related or abstractly speaking bring them 
into relation with one another i can think of them 
both as animals there is an immediate relation 
between them in my mind by attributing animality 
to both without any alteration in their previous con 
dition or i can fancy the man to have bought 
the horse there is then the relation of possessor 
and possessed in my mind now the reader will 
from these familiar instances clearly see that the 
word relation is only a mental conception and that 
even if the man and the horse just supposed were 
really placed in the imagined states though the 
relations would then be actual they would only be 
the result of a mental operation which depended 
on language for its existence for let us suppose 
the man and the horse to be viewed in reality in 
the imagined cases by a man born deaf and dumb 
and who had never been taught to read or write as 
he could never classify them in his mind as animals 
he could have no means of attributing a common 
nature to them because he would only see the man 
and the horse and he could likewise never think of 
the relation of possession for a relation not being 
like an image he could not from want of lan 
guage conceive any thing of the kind and further 
in the last case though he might be sufficiently 
aware by long experience of the value of money 



of relation abstract 

that the man had bought the horse the notion of 
ownership would be unknown to him for the reason 
already assigned namely that from his ignorance 
of language he had not the slightest conception of 
such an abstract relation and the utmost he could 
possibly conceive would be that the man was the 
owner of the horse the reader will see from these 
familiar illustrations that relations are but abstract 
states formed by the means of language and he 
must remember from what has been already said 
 that abstractions that is abstract rela 
tions are mere figments invented by the intellect 
for the purpose of reasoning just as algebraic signs 
are mere symbols by which relations of number 
or quantity are compared all he has to do with 
this or any other abstract term that may perplex 
him for the moment is to reduce it to its original 
which he will always find to be either a verb or an 
adjective relation itself therefore is to be referred 
to the verb to be related and the reader will re 
member that every relation necessarily supposes a 
mind capable of conceiving two or more tilings or 
acts as being related to one another either tempo 
rarily or permanently 

of relation personal 

 language not merely enables us to form 
abstract relations but to bring the whole social 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

world into a union that could never have existed 
without it for by it man has been enabled to invent 
terms that bind the whole fabric of society together 
thus we have sovereign and subject master and 
servant husband and wife father and child land 
lord and tenant and a multitude of other terms that 
have been invented to express the relation we stand 
in reciprocally to one another by the existence of 
these we are reminded of our duties even without 
the aid of morals though these words are general 
terms applicable to persons they are as purely con 
ceptional as those that are abstract for it would be 
as utterly impossible to prove their existence or 
reality as it would be that of whiteness goodness 
greatness c though they are of quite a different 
class of words they are not the names of persons 
but their supposed states or conditions were we 
to see an individual who was unknown to us we 
might be informed that he was a sovereign a mas 
ter a husband a father and a landlord but we 
could not be certain of the fact though he might 
combine all these relations in the mind of the per 
sons from whom we had received our information 
but if we were told that he was a man we should 
smile because our senses in all probability would 

 in addition to the foregoing relations he might be a brother an 
uncle a grandfather a nephew c yet no one would be foolish enough 
to suppose that he had so many individual natures as he stood in rela 
tions to others in the minds of those who spoke about him 



of relation personal 

previously have rendered the information unneces 
sary this points out to us that words implying 
relations are of a class differing from that which 
includes the names of things were we desirous of 
applying the sense of the foregoing words to persons 
in terms that do not express personal relationship 
we must make use of those that stand for agents 
thus for sovereign we can employ ruler for fa 
ther begetter and for landlord landletter and 
so on for others 



of correlation abstract and personal 

g though many words express relation there 
are only a few strictly speaking that possess corre 
lations but the others have each an opposite with 
which they stand in contrast thus goodness im 
plies badness elevation depression c the word 
cause equally suggests its correlation effect and 
the mention of this last likewise immediately calls 
up the notion of cause hence we see that they 
are necessarily connected the same is the case 
with all personal relations they have every one 
a specific correlation husband has wife father 
child c some indeed must from their being 
connected with sex have double correlations as 
father has both son and daughter uncle both 
nephew and niece c the mention of any relation 
must call up one of its corresponding correlations 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

the same is equally true of the correlations which 
must do the same should we however consider 
effect son wife c as relations then cause father 
husband c are their reciprocal correlations but 
it is more usual to call if i may employ the expres 
sion the major the relation and the minor the 
correlation i think as i have included abstract 
and personal correlations under one head it will be 
as well to enumerate here such relations abstract 
and personal with their correlations as seem of 
most importance 

abstract 
relations correlations 

cause effect 

reason consequence 

motive act or result 

origin end 

agency act 

source product 

 these are all the abstract relations that at 
this moment present themselves to my mind but 
the following are some that are personal 

personal 
relations correlations 

parent offspring 

sovereign subject 

master servant 

landlord tenant 



of correlation abstract and personal 

 these personal relations and correlations 
might be carried to a great extent but the instances 
here given will be sufficient as examples yet the 
terms though accurate are not sufficiently precise 
because they might be applied to such words as 
goodness and badness which are the mere contraries 
of one another the two classes therefore would 
be much more exactly defined by the terms major 
and minor relations for the reason that cause is 
always superior to effect source to product c so 
offspring wife servant tenant c are subordinate 
but not opposite to their correlations parent hus 
band master landlord c metaphysicians having 
had a vague feeling that abstract relations pro 
duced their correlations and forgetting or ignorant 
that they were but abstractions they were led to 
mix up the question of physical power with that of 
cause and effect and consequently arrived at con 
clusions altogether absurd and irreconcileable with 
common sense see 

of quality 

 i have now to give an account of the most 
important word employed in metaphysics quality 
is the very rock of metaphysical systems when exa 
mined however it will be found to vanish into thin 
air and to leave us nothing as a residuum we 
have derived this word from the latin through the 

g 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

french and it was brought into use in the former 
language by cicero in explaining the metaphysical 
notions of the greeks the greek word for it being 
irotorw he naturally made an equivalent which gave 
him qualitas derived from qualis implying like 
vrolog what or what manner thus far every thing 
is very good for even the two words from which 
the greek and latin were formed have a closer 
relationship than is commonly supposed but when 
we come to inquire what the exact sense of these 
two abstract terms is we find we can represent 
them in english by the words whatmanner stave 
or whatmannerness g both of which though a little 
bald and strange only require time and use to 
make them pass current for the same end as the 
orthodox word quality the arabs in translating 
greek works were in the same difficulty that 
cicero had been and strained the genius of their 
language a little to form the word kaifiyat from 
the adverb kaifa how hence their compound im 
plies howness instead of whatmannerness but the 
difference is so very slight as to be of no practical 
consequence the word so formed is still in current 

 the reader must feel that the argument deals with the nature 
of these abstract terms and not with this or that shade of meaning 
perhaps iroto and qualis if referred to their probable sanscrit origi 
nals might be rendered whatlike instead of whatmanner in this case 
the sense will be whatlikeness 

 r meninski in his lexicon explains the word kaifiyat by 
 qualitas modus quasi quomodeitas 



of quality 

use in the turkish persian and hindustani lan 
guages and very probably in those of some other 
mahomedan nations now most likely the reader 
has not only never doubted of the reality of quali 
ties but possibly never took the trouble of inquiring 
into the exact meaning of the word in all proba 
bility he will be a little surprised at the influence 
mere sounds have exercised over his understanding 
when he feels their exact import and he will 
perhaps be likewise convinced of the delusiveness 
of the division made by metaphysicians of qualities 
into primary and secondary we can have no 
notion of qualities except through the words that 
represent them thoagh we may talk of redness or 
whiteness as separate and real existences yet if we 
would understand what they mean we must think 
of some objects that are red or white for when we 
recall them to mind we remember the images 
that is the particular pictures or figured repre 
sentations they raised which were either red or 
white but it is evident we have no conception of 
red or white that is not coupled with some material 
thing or arising from its action on our optic nerve 
still objects are neither red nor white it is only 
something reflected from them photogen which 

 the word light implying merely a sensation some new term is 
necessary to distinguish the cause from the effect just in the same way 
as with respect to caloric and heat see 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

stimulates the retina and makes it feel in the way 
we call red white c 

 when we speak therefore of qualities we 
must always bear in mind that we do so by a mere 
form of speech indispensable to reasoning but that 
they have no more foundation in truth than the 
phrases sunrise and sunset which we still use and 
must continue to do though we are now convinced 
that the sun neither rises nor sets and that such 
appearances are made by the rotation of the earth 
on its axis in the same way though sensible qua 
lities are mere words we must never forget when 
we employ them that we merely mean to say that 
through the stimulation of the brain and nerves the 
percipient feels hot cold c and his retina red 
white c for sensible qualities must necessarily 
be in the subject or percipient yet they as well as 
those that are intellectual are commonly held to be 
in the object or thing contemplated it would be 
just as rational to say that the pain or pleasure we 
feel from cold or heat exists only in the object pro 
ducing it as to assert that the cold or heat we feel 
on placing our hand on something cold or hot 
exists only in the thing that has absorbed caloric 
from us or communicated it to us for heat and 
cold are mere sensations and so it will be allowed 
are pleasure and pain when therefore i put my 
hand on a jug filled with boiling water and reason 



of quality 



on the subject i am conscious that the jug is not 
hot but that my handeds hot by the transfer of 
caloric from the jug to it and it is the same with 
all other sensible qualities which exist therefore 
only in the organs of sense of the individual who 
perceives them 

 whenever our sight makes known any 
colour to us it must be bounded that is have what 
is called a form if the object is small enough to be 
seen at once but if not it extends to the whole 
range of vision which is necessarily round because 
it is so limited by the orifice of the eye through 
which the rays of colour are admitted we never 
therefore can see any colour without the certainty 
that it belongs to some object that is that there 
some real thing before us which we see with c 
eyes for even when we look at the expanse of 
heaven its azure hue the blue sensation made on 
our retina only arises from the absorption in t 
atmosphere of all the other rays except 
which is reflected to the eye here therefore the 
real thing before us is the air which we have 
much right to say we see in this instance as whe 
we think we see a house or any other object that 
stands before us and at which we look for 
every case we see nothing at all but only feel the 
particular kind of stimulation caused by one or moi 
ls of light transmitted to us all therefore we 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

can really and truly say is that our retina feels 
white red c and that these colours have certain 
shapes upon which we found the belief that certain 
objects are then before us which we likewise learn 
from sound touch taste or smell but the whole 
of these sensations can do no more than confirm one 
another and then we have altogether five witnesses 
instead of one still we can offer no proof that the 
whole five may not be all deceptive the reader 
however must now see that these five kinds of evi 
dence being only our own feelings we have no 
other proof for the reality of nature than the fact 
that we can feel in five different ways yet this 
simple truth is from the trickery of language 
represented or rather misrepresented by certain 
abstract terms we call sensible qualities or what 
mannernesses 

 with regard to intellectual qualities they 
exist only in the intellect of the person who draws 
the inference and they are necessarily in relation 
to his own opinions whether borrowed or self 
acquired and they will consequently vary with his 
knowledge and his fortunes as well as with the 
exigency of his situation at any particular moment 
thus a peasant lad would think every thing in the 
house of the farmer for whom he worked great 
fine excellent c but should he have an opportu 
nity of seeing the superior riches and conveniences 



of quality 

found in the mansion of his master s landlord his 
notions would be very much modified he in all 
probability would think every thing he had previ 
ously seen paltry and contemptible in comparison 
with what his new experience had made known to 
him and even his last notions would be quite 
eclipsed were chance to introdace him to the sight 
of the splendour and magnificence of a palace but 
to the eye of a philosopher the utmost magnificence 
might raise nothing but a smile of pity for the glit 
tering gewgaws with which the highest earthly 
rank attempts to dazzle the minds of the common 
herd of mankind in the same way what one in 
dividual or one state of society may think worthy of 
the highest approbation may be looked upon by 
another as utterly base and injurious to the best in 
terests of our race thus suicide was once re 
garded as heroic and worthy of a great man when 
deserted by fortune yet

lities which as unvarying truths must always be 
good or bad because the universal reason of man 
kind must ever approve or disapprove of them in 
reference to the immutable fitness of things and the 
inexorable claims arising out of human society 
the eternal distinction between right and wrong 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

can never vary truth too must be always one and 
unchangeable and justice must ever be what it is 
now and what it has been nor can honour ever 
shrink an atom from the scrupulous and voluntary 
fulfilment of its engagements whether tacitly or 
openly made that is to say through the duties 
incumbent on us by our peculiar position in society 
or by our formal pledges to mankind these obser 
vations lead to the inference that 

 qualities are either sensible or intellectual 



of property 

 the analogy between the terms quality 
and property is so strong that a few words will be 
quite sufficient to explain the meaning of the latter 
the word property has also been borrowed from 
the french and is a corruption of the latin pro 
prietas derived from proprius own proper c the 
property therefore of any substance implies the 
ownsi ate or ownness of that substance neither of 
which the reader will admit is so pleasing in sound 
though they are both equally cogent in sense with 
the word property to these remarks i might add 
that the arabs appear to have turned the greek 
thorns which had led to the latin proprietas into 
khassiyat so that all three have exactly the same 
sense this word like kaifiyat is still in common 



of property 

use like the word quality a property may be 
either sensible or intellectual thus length is the 
sensible property of a string as it can be discovered 
by both sight and feeling but the properties of the 
circle being only discoverable by the intellect are 
purely intellectual from these remarks it is evi 
dent that 

 properties from their nature may be eitlwr 
sensible or intellectual 



of peculiarity 

 the term peculiarity is so familiar and so 
obvious in its meaning that except for the sake of 
completing the whole view regarding qualities and 
properties it might very well have been omitted 
the peculiarity of any thing is that which distin 
guishes it from others of the same class as i shall 
immediately have to contrast qualities properties 
and peculiarities with one another the exact import 
of the last term will be sufficiently apparent when 
brought into juxtaposition with the two former 
from which it will be seen that peculiarities like 
qualities and properties may be both sensible and 
intellectual a peculiarity in short is nothing more 
than a quality that is of rare occurrence thus 
whiteness in a crow is a peculiarity made known to 
us by sight and is therefore sensible but timidity 



 op abstract general and particular terms 

in a lion would if observed be an intellectual pecu 
liarity because such a quality could only be ascer 
tained by an effort of the intellect peculiarity is 
likewise used to express any unusual form as well 
as state the hump of the indian cow is regarded 
as a peculiarity in europe and the want of it 
would be considered a peculiarity in india 

 peculiarity therefore implies unusualness 
both of quality and form in reference to the ex 
perience of the observer 

of quality property and peculiarity 

 having explained the nature of a quality 
and a property i mean now to define the exact 
manner in which they should be employed by a 
quality we always mean something adventitious 
and which though removed in no way destroys the 
object in which it is commonly held to exist thus 
a flower may lose its fragrance yet it will still 
remain a flower but by a property we invariably 
intend that which is essential to the very existence 
of the thing roundness for example in a ball 
thus to exemplify these terms we may assert that 
the colour of a wheel is its quality roundness its 
property and to be of metal when it is usually of 
wood its peculiarity here we see the extreme 
propriety of the word property which meaning 



of quality property and peculiarity 



 



ownness implies that it belongs to the thing itself 
and that without the possession of which it would 
cease to be what it is hence likewise its applica 
bility to express our own possessions all those 
attributes of bodies which metaphysicians call pri 
mary qualities are really nothing more than their 
properties these are figure length breadth ex 
tension impenetrability c for let us take away any 
one of these essentials and the thing ceases to be 
this fact is a proof that they reasoned not merely 
erroneously but actually without any precise know 
ledge of the terms they employed nay so incon 
siderate were they that they even included motion 
wdrest both implying states and also number 
which is a relation among the primary qualities 
and perhaps the following extract from berkeley s 
essay on human knowledge will not be out of place 
as demonstrating the inconsistencies of metaphysical 
writers some there are he says who make a 
distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualiti 
by the former they mean extension figure mot 
rest solidity or impenetrability and number 
latter they denote all other sensible qualities as 
lours sounds tastes and so forth the reader must 
see that in this division of qualities into primary 
and secondary besides its absurdity it altogether 
lits those that are intellectual when we reason 



that is our ownstatk or 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

respecting the qualities of any object we fancy we 
have very definite notions about it but were we to 
talk of its whatmannernesses though the term is 
much more significant we should be at once aware 
that nothing could be more vague than our expres 
sions and that consequently our conceptions on the 
point must be most incomplete with regard to 
secondary qualities the notion is equally incorrect 
as that of the primary division for both i have 
substituted sensible and intellectual it is worthy of 
remark in this place as giving some insight into the 
nature of the human intellect that people who have 
received a very slight education often apply the 
words quality property peculiarity c with the 
nicest accuracy by a sort of contrivance in the frame 
of the intellect that saves all effort on the part of 
the speaker and yet the profoundest thinkers 
are in danger of falling into great inconsistencies 
the moment they attempt to define and classify 
these or other abstract words see the remarks 
in 

of cause and effect 

 in the whole range of metaphysics there is 
not any subject that has been so much perplexed by 
philosophical inquirers nor one in which language 
plays a more delusive part than in that of cause and 
effect and yet i think i shall be able to demon 



of cause and effect 

strate that there is not any inherent difficulty in the 
question if it be properly considered 

 it might have been presumed that the very 
assertion that these words are related or connected 
which is made by every one who speaks of the 
relation or connexion of cause and effect might 
have saved so much misconception but this would 
be to suppose that people felt the force of the 
words they employ both these terms are merely 
abstractions of that class which is called relations 
and correlations and they consequently distinctly 
claim connexion with one another hence the terms 
cause and effect are necessarily connected for it 
is impossible to think of the word cause without 
its suggesting the notion of effect nor of effect 
without its calling up the conception of cause those 
therefore who deny a necessary connexion between 
cause and effect should abstain from employing 
these terms for it is as preposterous and incon 
sistent as it would be to speak of sunrise and sunset 
and yet to deny the existence of the sun cause 
and effect then being nothing but a relation with 
its correlation and such words being mere states 
it is only necessary to reflect for a moment and we 

 if this be the case with our own expressions there exists but 
little chance of being rightly comprehended by others i have myself 
been the object of misrepresentation because a reviewer c 
discriminate between a a reasoning being and a rational being 



 op abstract general and particular terms 

shall be certain that all we intend to express by them 
is that we conceive that the first state cause pro 
duces a second or correlative state effect again 
if we ask ourselves the exact meaning of these two 
states we must feel that that which implies cause 
means the state which alters not some other thing 
but another state and that which signifies effect 
the state which is altered or if we use compound 
terms they may both respectively be expressed by 
the alteringstate and the alteredstate for the 
whole process of the mind in reasoning is like that 
of calculation purely abstract and here i think it 
right to remind the reader that whenever we wish to 
avoid the use of the term cause or effect we ought 
to remember that we have the alternative of employ 
ing simple in place of abstract language thus if we 
do not desire to use the abstract word i cause in such 
a sentence as thomas was the cause of williams 
death we can have recourse to the direct form and 
say thomas killed william in the first of these two 
examples the matter is just put as abstractly as if it 
were stated algebraically a b and consequently 

 all reasoning is solely carried on by means of abstractions and 
when such abstractions are limited to number and quantity they can 
then be represented by ciphers and symbols that are employed for that 
particular branch of reasoning called calculation the only difference 
between them being that in common arithmetic we are obliged to sup 
ply mentally the connecting words required such as and make to 
from by into c for instance and make but in algebra 
the nature of the process required that the state of the relations should 



of cause and effect 

has nothing to do with either physical agency or 
power but in the second we may suppose the 
transmission of such power from the agent to the 
object and producing his death 

 having thus shown the abstract character 
of cause and effect i now proceed to demonstrate 
that these words are also general in their nature and 
as such are invariably the representatives of any 
particular conception thus we commonly say if a 
wall fall upon a man and kill him that the wall was 
the cause of his death but the wall merely stood in 
the relation of cause and the abstract agency that 
is conceived to produce his death was the falling of 
the wall but such sentences being always elliptical 
they would if fully expressed enounce that the wall 
stood in the relation ofcttuse to that effect it is no 
matter what sentence we may analyse in which cause 
is mentioned for we shall find that the particular 
word which is the real cause is a noun of action 



be fully expressed and they are accordingly represented by signs 
 x f c which have superseded the more cumbrous use of 
words of the early stage of the science every one is aware that a 
calculation may be conducted in such a way that the process shall not 
include the slightest error and yet that if the data were either insuf 
ficient or erroneous the calculation must be useless it is thesamc 
with reasoning for if the facts arc either incomplete or faulty the con 
clusion any one may arrive at will be equally so hence it is clear 
that we may reason with perfect correctness and yet be quite wrong in 
the result 

ii 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

ending in ing such as that of falling just given r or 
in tion in that of ignition which i shall mention 
directly for instance a hailstone breaks a window 
it is not the hailstone but its breaking that is the 
cause of the fracture so if i say heat is the cause of 
fluidity i is heat stands in the relation of producing 
to the abstract result fluidity cause and effect 
therefore are the mere general forms which the in 
tellect employs in place of the particular expression 
which the case requires as is discovered the moment 
the sentence is analysed in the instances of falling 
breaking and producing as the particular notions 
represented by the term cause we must see that 
they all denote the altering state or action of the 
wall the hailstone and the heat and the results that 
arose from them respectively namely death frac 
ture and fluidity were the altered states of the man 
the window and the solid as the objects affected by 
them this points out why we cannot with propriety 
say i cause it for if we could use this expression we 
could equally well employ breaking it i producing 
it it is different however with the word fracture 
for as we can say i fractured it so we can also say 
 effected it when cause is employed as a personal 
agent as when we say he was the cause of it we 
actually make as great a mistake as if we said he was 
the breaking of it and in those languages that em 
ploy a word equivalent to causer the error is as 
great as if they added er to the word breaking or 



of cause and effect 

any other noun implying action and said breakingcr 
prodncinger c instead of employing breaker pro 
ducer c see it is obvious therefore from 
the whole tenour of these observations that cause 
and effect are the most general notions we can trace 
of any abstract agency and that whether we say the 
breaking produced the fracture or the hailstone broke 
the window we do in neither case that is to say 
either by the abstract or the simple form of expres 
sion allude or refer openly or covertly to cause 
and effect to do so then we must invariably and 
explicitly say or understand such and such an abs 
traction is the cause or is the effect but ivhen we 
consider it under this aspect we then call into ope 
ration one of the most general forms of expression 
the human intellect has at its disposal where there 
fore there is no knowledge of language there can 
be no cause and effect no one will suppose that 
a horse thinks of either when he feels the rider s leg 
move to give him the spur yet it is sufficient to 
make him mend his pace 

 the process by which any one might form to 
himself the notion of this relation may be explained 

 the word widower affords an excellent example of the mistakes 
we fall into when we are not aware of the exact import of the original 
term which we take as a basis widow like the latin vidua is derived 
from the sanscrit vidhava that is vi without uhavas a husband so 
that widower implies a man without a husband if we refer it to its 
sanscrit originals but a hewidow according to its english derivation 

it 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

as follows suppose a child to apply a piece of 
paper to a lighted candle he would see it take fire 
and disappear and if asked about it would simply 
reply that the candle had burnt the paper but he 
would not have the most remote conception of cause 
and effect and that for the best of reasons namely 
that he had no knowledge of this or any other rela 
tion we will suppose him arrived at maturity and 
to make a repetition of the same act having by 
this time become master of the phrase i cause and 
effect and other abstractions he could now say 
that the candle w r as the cause and what took place 
the effect and so he would think he knew all about 
it but if we suppose him to be able to reflect we 
may imagine him to have some knowledge of the 
real value of words and consequently to feel that 
the term effect was but an abstraction and that 
though he had thought the candle to be the cause 
this could not possibly be the case as a concrete 
thing the candle could not produce the abstract 
state effect after a little consideration he would 
see that if the correlation effect was an abstrac 
tion its relation must be equally so he might then 
ask himself what was the particular effect that oc 
curred in the instance of the candle and he would 
feel that it was combustion the moment he 
was aware of this he would seek for the particular 
abstraction that the mind required to stand in re 
lation to it and he would discover that it was 



s 



of cause and effect 

ignition he would now feel that the ignition 
by the candle produced the combustion of the 
paper and that when the matter was expressed 
solely by general language the candle only stood 
in the relation of ctiise the ignition to the effect 
combustion and that both cause and effect were 
simply abstractions of the highest generality and not 
things if acquainted with the elements of algebra 
he would be aware that he could not say candle b 
but that if he used the abstract sign i he must com 
pare it with another sign equally abstract and he 
would consequently say a b this shows to what 
an extent metaphysicians have deceived themselves 
in supposing that things and physical power had any 
thing to do with the abstract and general conception 
cause and effect and as to the sequences they 
talk about these though they do exist in a limited 
degree in nature and art have nothing to do with 
the intellectual sequences which are alone connected 
with this relation for instance a good disposition 
and cultivation stand in the relation of causes to good 
principles these too stand in the same relation to 
virtuous actions and these again to happiness not 

 here it is evident that ignition is the alteringstate and com 
buxtion the altercdstate the previous state of the paper was cohesion 
in which combustion has induced a change of state or condition that is 
to say such is the abstract expression of the fact hut the simple truth 
that is evident to the senses is as a child would express himself 
that the candle burnt the paper 

 see of note b of the appendix 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

withstanding however the continual reference made 
by hume and others to the notion of sequence there 
are very few sequences in nature which stand in the 
relation of cause and effect thus one season 
does not produce another winter does not give 
rise to spring nor does the greenness of the leaf 
in spring occasion the brown tint observed in it in 
autumn the flow does not force on the ebb of the 
tide nor the ebb the flow neither does day draw 
on the night nor night the day the antecedents 
in all these cases are not the causes but the con 
ditions of their consequents the only relation they 
stand in to one another being that of contrast 

 the word cause is so often confounded with 
reason and motive that i feel that the next step 
should be to clear up the ambiguity let us sup 
pose we saw an infant lying dead which we ex 
pected to find alive and well we should naturally 
ask what was the cause of its death and if we were 
answered neglect the cause would then be as 
signed but if we asked again by whose neglect 
and were told by its mother s our knowledge of the 
cause would be enlarged by being put in possession 
of the reason and if we pushed our inquiries 

 gtis here we see an instance that an abstract word can stand in the 
relation of cause a thing never suspected to such an extent has 
this question been misunderstood cause always represents abstract 
and never physical agency 



of cause and effect 

further and demanded on what account and were 
answered from her antipathy to it we should then 
have the motive as we already had the cause and 
the reason of its death here we see clearly why 
these notions are so closely connected together in 
the mind and as it will be necessary hereafter to 
investigate each of them in its proper place i shall 
content myself with having pointed out the reason of 
their being so often substituted for one another 
having premised these general remarks i proceed 
to consider the most celebrated opinions that have 
been held with regard to this relation from anti 
quity to the present time begging the reader to 
bear in mind that cause and effect do not exist in 
the works and processes of nature and art but only 
in the conception of the mind that reasons upon 
them m 

 pyrrho was the first great doubter among 
the greeks who seems to have been deluded by the 
trickery of language the opinion of himself and 
followers as handed down by diogenes laertius 



 when i speak of conceptions existing in the mind in any part 
of these remarks and the reader remembers that i say conceptions arc 
mere words preserved by the memory he must not suppose that 
i contradict myself tn g i have shown what the phrase 
the mind really means conceptions exist then in the forms of 
speech that constitute what we call the mind but not in the intel 
lect see and the last sentence of 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

and interpreted by sir james mackintosh is as fol 
lows causation they take away thus a cause 
is so only in relation to an effect what is relative 
is only conceived but does not exist therefore 
cause is a mere conception now every word of 
this is as true as that two and two make four 
but the inference he was said to draw from it was 
altogether a delusion from his ignorance of the na 
ture of language that cause is only a relation 
every just reasoner will allow and that effect is 
the name of its correlative relation will be equally 
granted but when this is done and we admit that 
relations are only creatures of the mind we have in 
no respect done away with the things or persons 
that we have conceived to be related and when it 
was said that pyrrho would not get out of the way 
of a carriage because he had convinced himself that 
cause and effect were mere conceptions he was as 
absurd as a man who should say to himself father 
and son are mere relations now as all relationship 
is a mental conception there are no such creatures as 

 note q in sir james mackintosh s dissertation on the pro 
gress of ethical philosophy 

 i had printed an essay on cause and effect to prove its concep 
tional character before i was aware that i had been anticipated by 
pyrrho i have reprinted it in note b of the appendix that 
part which related to power and which did not strictly belong to the 
question of cause and effect will be found under g of the 
text and some remarks on ex nihilo nihilfit in note d of 
the appendix 



of cause and effect 

men and i will not therefore get out of the way of 
that mad son of mine who threatens to run me through 
with his sword the absurdity of this last instance 
is too strong to require any other comment than 
that it would have been strictly in accordance with 
the notions and conduct attributed to pyrrho if we 
do not relieve him from the imputation of being so 
very inconsistent by supposing that his extreme 
scepticism had raised him up enemies who have 
wilfully misrepresented his opinions he must 
have been too well aware that the conceptional 
character of any form of speech in which a fact may 
be described cannot react on the fact itself and 
disprove its existence 

 the delusive influence of language over 
the mind is equally shown in algazel the ara 
bian for of him it is said that he denied a neces 
sary connexion between cause and effect for of 
two things the affirmation of the existence of the 
one does not necessarily contain the affirmation of 
the other and the same may be said of denial 
when algazel denied a necessary connexion be 
tween cause and effect he quite overlooked the 
fact that these two words were not merely relations 
but that they were moreover of that kind in which 
as i have before said effect is the correlation of 

 sec note q in sir james mackintosh s dissertation on the 
nf ethical philosophy 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

cause and that by this very circumstance they 
imply one another and consequently must be neces 
sarily connected cause must therefore as uni 
formly suggest the notion of effect as father does 
that of child and husband that of wife but when 
we have convinced ourselves of this fact it still 
cannot be applied to prove as algazel remarked 
that of two separate things the affirmation of the 
existence of the one necessarily contains the affir 
mation of the other algazel therefore was both 
right and wrong he was wrong in his inference 
which is the leading member of his sentence and 
he was quite right in the last clause which is that 
from which he drew it though his assertion was a 
mere truism his mistake arose from his not being 
aware that in the first case he was dealing with 
abstract relations and in the other with realities as 
is proved by his employing the words two sepa 
rate things he consequently made the mistake 
that is inevitable from confounding together these 
opposite classes of words algazel s error is that 
of all metaphysicians they forget that the per 
ception is a thing but that the relation in which 
it stands is a mere conception now the cause 
being a relation it leads to interminable confusion 
in reasoning to suppose it and the thing related to be 
one and the same he likewise fell into another 
error that is uniformly made by those who reason 
on the nature of cause and effect and not merely 



of cause and effect 

forgot that these words are simply abstract rela 
tions but that an effect no more than a cause can 
ever be a thing but a change produced by that 
which the mind conceives to stand in the relation 
of cause which change is properly called an effect 
and not a thing nay so far from this being 
the case any one has only to attend to the course of 
common conversation or to the works lie may read 
and he will find that we as often refer to a single 
abstract word a whole sentence or even a long 
detail of facts as standing in the relation of 
cause as we do to things and for the same 
reason we equally assert that another word or 
set of circumstances was the effect thus we 
say virtue is the cause of happiness in which 
that which stands in the relation of cause is 
a single word and that an abstract one too while 
it amounts to a whole sentence in the following 
remark the cause of the fickleness and injustice 
of the multitude effects does not merely arise from 
their ignorance and envy but from their acting 
at all times under the impulse of the moment in 
stead of their being guided by the dictates of reason 
and reflection and from the same causes there can be 
effects no stability in democratic communities if they 
are not driven into a state of union by pressure from 
without a position that quickly awakens them to a 
sense of gratitude and obliges them to look again for 
assistance from those who had proved themselves the

tried friends and benefactors of the commonwealth 
so also gibbon might have summed up the con 
tents of his great history by saying such were 
the causes that led to effects the decline and fall 

 the unworthy treatment experienced by aristides and scipio 
africanus two of the greatest patriots as well as the best men of anti 
quity will sufficiently support this opinion those who admire repub 
lics will point to the united states of america but they should 
remember that its back woods are the safetyvalve where the more 
daring and restless spirits of the nation can find a proper scene for 
their activity and that but for this relief their system must have 
exploded long ago the united states afford the extraordinary 
spectacle of a people without a government for an executive that is 
under the necessity of fulfilling the bidding of the populace at every 
effervescence of feeling is no government in the proper sense of the 
word as this term can only apply to that which is able to control 
not foreign nations but its own people if there is one name more 
than another that the americans must revere it is that of washington 
and one for whom perhaps they can never hope to produce a 
parallel but let them remember that his integrity straightforward 
conduct and disinterestedness were not the result of their system but 
of that which gave birth to the moral dignity of a chatham and the 
host of other illustrious men for which great britain will be renowned 
as long as history endures it is english institutions that have 
reason to be proud of washington and not the northamerican 
republic which was the offspring and not the parent of the deliverer 
of his country every good that america can boast of she has 
derived from the parent state and she would commit the parricidal 
act of destroying her if she could because she cannot forget the injus 
tice of one obstinate ruler who was never countenanced hi his coercive 
measures by our wisest statesmen nor by the nation at large does 
she suppose for a moment that either selfrespect or glory would 
result from the success of such an effort no foreign nations would 
only exult and exclaim thank god one portion of the anglosaxon 
race is extinguished as an empire may the remainder soon perish by its 
own turbulent and unruly hand 



of cause and effect 

of the roman empire yet in all these instances 
that which stands in the relation of cause is not a 
 thing nor does it convey the notion of physical 
agency 

 the opinion of saint thomas aquinas being 
identical with that of hume indeed so much 
so that the latter is supposed to have derived it 
from him it is only necessary to mention his 
name here in the chronological order in which 
this celebrated man lived and i pass on to locke 
w r ho is the next great authority and who seems to 
have been quite ignorant of the important truth 
discovered and misapplied by pyrrho namely 
that the relation of cause and effect was merely 
a mental conception the definition locke gives 
of cause and effect is as follows a cause is 
that which makes any other thing either simple idea 
substance or mode begin to be and an effect is that 
which had its beginning from something else here 
locke in assigning his notion of cause explains 
his conception of an effect at the same time and 
he then tells us again in less express terms what he 
considers is an effect so far from thinking cause 
a relation he says it is that which makes any 
other thing either simple idea substance or mode 
begin to be he has here been misled by the 

 bk ii ch xxvi 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

meaning of the verb to cause see and con 
verts a cause into an agent or maker and an effect 
so far from being the mere change altered state 
resulting from the action of that which stood in the 
relation of cause he considers as a simple idea 
substance or mode which the agent has made to 
begin to be the definition is at once verbose 
and erroneous for if a production or creature can be 
said to be an effect that is a change there is an 
end to all distinctions of language 

 the foregoing remarks on locke s notion 
of cause and effect will be sufficient to show that 
he had not a true conception of the nature of the 
relation and that in fact like all other philosophers 
who went before him pyrrho excepted he con 
ceived that things could be both causes and effects 
i now therefore proceed to consider the remarks 
of hume who has done more than all other writers 
to perplex this question and as his authority has 
had great influence it will be necessary to consider 
his opinions with the closest attention he sets out 
by saying that all reasonings concerning matter 
of fact seem to be founded on the relation of cause 
and effect by the means of that relation alone we 
can go beyond the evidence of our memory and 
senses he then a little afterwards says causes 

 e essays vol ii section ii 



of cause and effect ill 

and effects are discoverable not in reason but by 
experience but to show that when he made use of 
the terms cause and effect he had not any idea of 
their true nature it is only necessary to attend to 
the following quotations all the operations of 
bodies without exception are known only by expe 
rience again when we reason a priori and 
consider merely any object or cause as it appears 
to the mind independent of all observation it never 
could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object 
such as its effect much less show us the inseparable 
and inviolable connexion between them finally 
his two formal definitions of cause and effect may 
be brought in evidence 

 similar objects he says are always conjoined 
with similar of this we have experience suit 
ably to this experience therefore we may define a 
cause to be an object followed by another and where 
all the objects similar to the first are followed by 
objects similar to tjie second or in other words 
wliere if the first object had not been the second had 
never existed the appearance of a cause always 
conveys the mind by a customary transition to the 
idea of the effect of this also we have experience 
we may therefore suitably to this experience 
form another definition of cause and call it 
an object followed by another y and whose appearance 
always conveys the thought to that other but though 
both these definitions be drawn from circumstances 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

foreign to the cause we cannot remedy this in 
convenience or attain any more perfect definition 
which may point out that circumstance in the cause 
which gives it a connexion with its effect 

now if the reader give but the most cursory 
attention to these extracts he will feel that hume 
had totally mistaken the nature of the relation and 
that he was considering the observed operations and 
phenomena of nature in which of course he 
sought in vain for a necessary connexion and not 
the purely intellectual distinctions which we set up 
as often as we reason upon those operations when 
we consider them in the abstract that we know 
nothing except from experience few would have 
been inclined to doubt after the perusal of locke s 
work to give therefore hume the benefit of 
being merely consistent in his arguments we must 
always understand that his objects or causes are 

 hume by this remark apparently alludes to the notion of 
power as the true cause but neither he nor locke had even ima 
gined that there could be a distinction between abstract and physical 
power both metaphysicians were realists and therefore every thing 
they spoke of was in their imaginations equally real see note to 
 

 essays vol ii section vii part ii not to distract the 
reader s attention i have not made any observations on the verbal 
inaccuracies in the above extracts but in he will have 
specimens of the internal constitution of hume s arguments that will 
show him how unsafe a guide so loose and vague a reasoner really is 
and how much he dealt in mere phrases and words of which he had 
not previously fixed the meaning 



op cause and effect 

not abstract relations but the real things we dis 
cover by our senses he consequently argues to 
show that we know nothing of the nature of the 
necessary connexion between objects that is why 
one change follows another and that therefore we 
have no authority but custom or habit for attri 
buting a necessary connexion to cause and effect 
two mere abstract relations that i have shown to 
be inseparably connected by their related existence 
in the mind when he said therefore that it was 
 by means of the relation of cause and effect we are 
enabled to go beyond the evidence of our memory and 
senses he was really drawing strongly upon the 
want of reflection to which mankind are prone on 
such subjects for who thinks of either cause or 
effect when he calls to mind a kindness or an 
injury or the scenes and friends of his childhood 
and yet no one doubts the excellence of his memory 
and senses with regard to the past it is evident 
therefore that when hume attempted to prove that 
the universal notion of the necessary connexion 
between cause and effect is only derived from ex 
perience he fell into a palpable fallacy he over 
looked the fact and as i have shown the very im 
portant distinction too that the necessary connexion 
between cause and effect as mere abstract relations 

 hume invariably considered tftiiiix in operation as cause 
 i it is clear that hume did not fed the distinction between these 
tvo words see gt 

i 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

exists in the mind and not between the phenomena 
of nature and it therefore follows that the question 
of cause and effect has nothing to do with that of 
experience a consequence that could not fail to 
have been perceived by hume had he known what 
was the true nature of the relation but from what 
i have already said and what remains to be shown 
it is clear that neither he nor his predecessors with 
the exception of pyrrho had any but the most 
crude conception of its character his essay will 
always remain as a proof how much a fine compo 
sition will serve as an impenetrable veil to conceal 
the greatest fallacies and inconsistencies but so far 
from throwing any light on the relation of cause 
and effect he might just as well have danced an 
elegant minuet in its place indeed he has by his 
authority thrown such a gloom over the question 
that those who have since reasoned upon it have 
not been able to see their way in the least through 
its perplexities 

 so after all the parade made by hume in 
this essay on a necessary connexion and which he 
evidently flung amongst metaphysicians with the 
same glee that zeno did his sophism relating to 
motion it turns out that this modern achilles 
like its celebrated prototype is nothing more than 
an oversight it would indeed be strange if the hu 
man understanding were so ignorant and weak as 



of cause and effect 

he supposes it and that it had such a universal 
conviction without any just foundation in short 
that it believed in what there was no warrant for 
believing and that equally among the most savage 
as well as the most civilised races in ancient as well 
as in modern times 



 it will not perhaps surprise any one after 
these remarks that hume should make another mis 
take in the same essay though he had unwittingly 
fallen upon the true distinction by the mere forms of 
routine phrases when uninfluenced by system for 
in the following passages he has employed the word 
event and yet inconsistently enough immediately 
after uses object as a synonymous term the mistake 
is greater than that made by algazel for he con 
founded things with abstract relations but hume 
in this case has committed the error of making an 
event the same as an object his words are 

 solidity extension motion these quali 
ties are all complete in themselves and never point 
out any other event which may result from them 
the scenes of the universe are continually shifting 



 hume borrowed the words solidity extension and motion from 
locke as may be seen by referring to of this work this is 
the way new systems are built up old materials are taken without 
any examination of their soundness and few men quarry for them 
selves 

i 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

and one object follows another in an uninterrupted 
succession but the power or force which actuates 
the whole machine is entirely concealed from us 
and never discovers itself in any of the sensible qua 
lities of body 

 we should certainly think that any one who 
might write a passage like the following had a 
greater knowledge of phrases than of the things he 
was describing 

 guns balls gunpowder these qualities are all 
complete in themselves and never point out any 
other event which may be produced by them the 
scenes of an arsenal are continually shifting and one 
object follows another in uninterrupted succession 
but the care or attention which regulates the whole 
magazine is entirely concealed from us and never 
discovers itself in any of the sensible qualities of the 
materials of war 

 perhaps the above farrago will rather startle 
the reader though he may have read the passage 
which has given rise to it without his attention being 
roused yet what causes this difference of judg 
ment simply this that from his infancy he has 
been familiarised with the objects just enumerated 
and he is at once aware of the incongruities heaped 

 essay vol ii section vii part i 



of cause and effect u 

together but in the other case he does not perhaps 
feel the exact value of each word because they are 
mere abstractions the import of which can only be 
learned by a thorough knowledge of language and 
deep reflection for in those matters that are above 
our comprehension we are too apt to be contented 
with periods that are elegantly turned and in which 
an easy flow of language prevents us from suspecting 
inconsistency we must therefore be convinced 
that in such cases our imagination is at the best 
but agreeably soothed and tickled by an harmonious 
concord of sounds arranged in such correct gram 
matical dependence as must always lull our atten 
tion and consequently prevent us from detecting 
the imposition that has been practised upon our 
judgment but to show that the above representa 
tion is not overstrained i proceed to the analysis of 
hume s own words 

 now passing over the fact that solidity 
and extension are properties and not qualities and 
that motion is a state and neither a property nor a 
quality and that not one of these words moreover 
can even by the utmost torturing of language be 
called an event we must still admit that there 
exists a singular degree of confusion in this passage 
for how could it be expected by any one who knew 
the exact import of words that the power or force 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

which actuates the whole machine should discover 
 itself in any of the sensible qualities of body 
the operation of power or force sufficient to 
move a machine can only be discovered by the mo 
tion of some of its parts and such motion is not a 
 sensible quality but as i have just said a state 
and how could it be produced by either of the abs 
tractions force or power but it must be further 
seen that hume employed the word object in the 
same sense as event and if the reader has any mis 
givings on the subject he will find this fact placed 
beyond all doubt by attending to a second quotation 
i shall make it is very likely that he has like myself 
often read both these passages without ever feeling 
the nonsense they contain this will prove to him 
how easy it is for us to trip lightly over what is 
written with smoothness and elegance and how 
necessary it is to weigh every expression where truth 
is at stake the same confusion subsisting in his 
mind as in the former passage he says 

but when one particular species of event has 
always in all instances been conjoined with another 
we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one 
upon the appearance of the other and of employing 
that reasoning which can alone assure us of any 
matter of fact or existence we then call the one 
object cause the other effect we suppose that 
there is some connexion between them some power 



of cause and effect 

in the one by which it infallibly produces the other 
and operates with the greatest certainty and strong 
est necessity v 

 these are interesting instances how an acute 
and powerful mind may be betrayed into false rea 
soning by not possessing an accurate and almost 
instinctive feeling of the force of words even the 
first sentence in the above passage is incorrect in 
reasoning and expression because he makes the 
word event stand for both cause and effect and 
so also in the next for the mere sake of avoiding 
tautology he employs object for event it is diffi 
cult however to imagine how he could have fallen 
into the error of supposing an effect to be an object 
even if he knew not or had forgotten that both it 
and cause are merely abstract relations indeed 
the whole passage is a tissue of absurdities 

 essays vol ii section vii tart ii 

 hume may have taken the word event in the sense of occur 
rence instead of the consequence or result of an action which is what 
the subject demanded either effect or change would have been 
a much less ambiguous term for his purpose than event it has 
however become a favourite expression with succeeding metaphy 
sicians mankind seem led to copy one another by the same unerring 
instinct that makes a flock of sheep follow the bellwether 

these views were written while i bad not an opportunity of con 
sulting plume s work on human nature but his essays and the pas 
sage already ltmotcd will show that be used the word ohject syste 
matically and it follows that e vent was only introduced by way 
of changing the phrase the confusion of thought that led to his 
making an indiscriminate use of these two words in a similar sense 
is remarkable 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

 it is seldom that any error is detected 
which is of itself not obvious till it has produced its 
full consequences and then the extreme case at 
which the understanding has arrived being evi 
dently absurd even to the multitude those who 
assume the airs and name of philosophers are reluc 
tantly forced to reconsider the steps that have led 
them to such extravagant conclusions when a fresh 
inquiry often helps them to discover the first step 
that led them into their error the misconception 
of hume gave rise to no less a consequence than the 
extraordinary work of kant called the critick of 
pure reason but though this renowned produc 
tion of misapplied genius on its first appearance 
startled every person of sound sense yet the fallacy 
upon which it is founded was so far from having 
been detected that the work has even won the ap 
plause of many who were the first to feel doubts 
respecting its truth hume had by his false reason 
ings so perplexed the question of cause and effect 
that the minds of men were ready for the reception 
of almost any solution of the difficulty he had started 
regarding a necessary connexion and though he 
had said that the true solution was that it arose 
from custom or habit yet kant at once saw that this 
could not possibly be the case but then he did not 
at the same time perceive that hume had attri 
buted this connexion to the phenomena of nature 
and not to its real constituents mere abstractions 



of cause and effect 

that we employ as antecedents and consequents in 
reasoning kant therefore began to hunt about for 
some better solution of the problem of error than 
custom and he thought he found it in necessity 
reflecting upon this supposed discovery he consi 
dered that if the human understanding had this one 
conception not drawn from that grand storehouse of 
our knowledge experience which locke had laid 
open to mankind we might have more and from 
this notion he deduced his tw r elve celebrated cate 
gories or intuitions on which he built his transcen 
dental system as these are too important to be 
omitted in this work the reader will find them more 
appropriately considered in however 
it will be as well to see what hints can be found of 
kant s own notion of cause and effect first then 
it will be thought not a little remarkable that a 
mind so logical as his should have uttered a phrase 
so near the truth as that every change has its 
cause without feeling that the word change 
being an abstraction its true antecedent must ne 
cessarily be an abstract word of the same nature 
had he but seen this inevitable conclusion lie would 
have been at once led to feel that the two concep 
tions or words stood in the state of relation and 
correlation to one another and that therefore as 
such they but not the phenomena of nature were 

 gt l igt ltj of the critifk of pure ramon 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

necessarily linked together in the mind but having 
persuaded himself that though hume s solution was 
faulty yet that the view he had taken of the rela 
tion was right he brought himself to believe that 
the notion of the connexion between the operations 
and phenomena of nature instead of being derived 
from experience exists through the constructive 
form which pure reason see confers through 
its absolute nature upon the materials presented 
to it by the understanding upon this 
unsound foundation it was that kant built up 
his fallacious system an inverted pyramid which 
rests like the mercury of john of bologna only 
on a breath necessity to the dark and intricate 
convolutions of kant s systematic and logical brain 
must be attributed the order symmetry and ob 
scurity that have at once delighted astonished and 
confounded his readers but when he placed such 
reliance on hume and made so capital a mistake 



 j shakspeare who seems to have observed every thing that came 
within his reach appears to have had in his eye the beautiful and 
graceful statue of mercury rising from the breath of zephyr in these 
lines 

 a station like the herald mercury 
newlighted on a heavenkissing hill 

the puffedout cheeks of zephyr when the figure is viewed in front 
from below bear a strong resemblance to a hill and a friend in my 
presence though possessed of excellent sight and judgment made this 
mistake at the first glance he took of a small plaster cast of this fine 
specimen of modern art 



of cause and effect 

he was not aware that the conception of necessity 
like all other notions being a mere abstraction has 
no other existence than as a word and that had 
locke even been in error with regard to the doc 
trine of experience it gave him kant no grounds 
to establish a system built entirely on mere abstract 
relations that are only so many symbols for reason 
ing the very ability displayed in his work being 
the more pernicious by its tendency to fetter the 
understandings of mankind already too much en 
slaved and oppressed by the misconceptions of pre 
ceding writers 

 any one who has attended to the tenour of 
the preceding remarks as well as to the arguments 
of modern writers will be at no loss to discover that 
the sources of error on this question by metaphysi 
cians are threefold 

 first they consider a thing or object as 
being a cause and they do the same likewise with 
regard to an effect the consequence of this mis 
conception is that though they talk of the relation 
of cause and effect when the context leads them to 
the right term they utterly overlook their own in 
consistency and forget that an abstract relation 
cannot imply either a thing or object 

 secondly deluded by language they suppose 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

that a relation can be converted into a verb and 
that the verb to cause has therefore the same 
sense as the relation of cause now to cause 
meaning to effect as an agent they are evidently 
talking of an agent when they suppose they are 
speaking of the relation of cause and effect and 
then carrying out this error a step farther they 
imagine the term causation implying the act or 
power of causing that is of effecting like an agent 
means the relation of cause and effect also though 
we have seen that any abstraction sentence or 
chain of reasoning can stand in the relation of 
cause 

 thirdly having got so far into the error of 
substituting agent for abstract agency we find hume 
very naturally going one step farther still than his 
predecessors and inquiring into the notion of 
power which must lie at the bottom of every ques 
tion relating to the phenomena of nature the 
magnificent and mysterious operations observable 
in the universe could not fail therefore to be the 
first subject upon which he would fix his attention 
and seeing that one change follows another in an 
uninterrupted sequence yet one in which human 
reason cannot discover any necessary connexion he 
triumphantly turned round and asked how it is 
that mankind so firmly believe in the necessary 
connexion of cause and effect pleased with the 



of cause and effect 

grand discovery lie thought he had made of a con 
tradiction between fact and belief it may be easily 
imagined that he said to himself look now at the 
 ignorance and weakness of the human under 
standing see how it believes in what it can offer no 
reason for doing and that too in what is of the 
first consequence to all belief 

 the remedy for all this confusion is not to 
talk of the relation of cause and effect till we 
have a clear conception of its nature and never 
in any instance to employ the word causation for 
abstract agency nor cause for agent by which 
means we shall then cease to talk like the school 
men of such things as 

 first cause 

 efficient cause 

 material causc 

 final cause 

and we shall consequently bear in mind that we 
are no longer speaking of relations but agents as 
the word cause in the two first of the above instances 
has no other sense the advantage that would 

 the expression causa causarum is incorrect as the word 
causa is here used in the sense of agent while source or origin is 
what is alone admissible if we attend to common sinse and logic two 
things that can never exist separately the arahic phrase musah 
bibu i asbab causer of came thouch more correct in form is 
faulty in conception see 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

attend such a reform would be that we should then 
be aware of the superior clearness of our reason 
ings if we called these expressions respectively by 
the name of 

 creator or origin 

 operative agent 

 matter or substance 

 end or purpose 

because in every process of thought it is of the first 
consequence to have terms that are perfectly clear 
and unambiguous we have still too many relics of 
the jargon of the schools and the sooner we dismiss 
them the better 

 the foregoing remarks contain all i think 
it is necessary to offer on the relation of cause and 
effect when it is unconnected with reason and 
consequence and the other relations with which it is 
so often and unavoidably mixed up and i there 
fore proceed to the consideration of these last which 
will moreover be of use in helping to dispel any 
delusion the reader may still labour under on this 
much misunderstood subject and i therefore con 
clude this branch of the inquiry with three defini 
tions of cause and effect out of which the reader 
can select that which best suits the form of his 
mind 

 whatever produces a change stands in our 



of cause and effect 

minds in the relation of cause and whatever 
change results from it in that of effect 

or in other words 

cause is that general relation which we contem 
plate as effecting whatever we see take place 

effect is that general correlation which ive con 
ceive to result from that which stands in relation 

to it 

or again 

cause is the alteringstate 
effect is the 



of reason and consequence 

 the question of reason and consequence 
being as i have already said so much connected 
with that of cause and effect the consideration of 
it naturally follows as the next in the order of sub 
jects it is singular that its obvious connexion with 
cause and effect has been altogether overlooked in 
every investigation regarding the latter question 
and still more so when even a child appeals to the 
fact as often as it assigns a reason for its actions 
yet in every instance in which the word because 
by cause is employed we have an example of 

 the common use of because is itself a proof how natural is 
the tendency of the mind to confound cause and reason together for 
instead of because we ought to employ l liy reason so we use in 
differently for one another the expressions through this cause for 

this 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

the conjunction of these two relations whenever 
therefore we employ this word there is a reason 
given in which we shall also see an example of 
cause and effect and it is further of the greatest 
value in placing beyond all contradiction and dis 
pute the abstract nature of the word cause by its 
means therefore and that of the word effect which 
explains itself to every mind we may satisfy our 
selves that cause never means a thing as has 
been supposed by all metaphysicians if we except 
pyrrho though he knew not how to avail himself of 
the truth he had discovered we shall likewise be 
able to ascertain with perfect clearness why rea 
son can be always substituted for it at pleasure as 
well as the word motive whenever it relates to a 
rational being and we shall consequently see that 
the human understanding so far from displaying 
 ignorance and weakness as hume supposed is 
really always in the right when left to its own 
discretion and that its deficiencies are almost inva 
riably the result of an attempt to force what we do 
not fully comprehend into some system that we 
have taken up immaturely a case that may be 
illustrated by that of gravitation which when left 
to its own influence brings down to the earth every 

this reason on this account and therefore as if they had all one 
and the same sense the word reason itself is not altogether that 
which ought to be employed as it is the account or explanation 
which reason renders to itself of the operations observed in nature 
and art that we really intend by its use 



 



of cause and effect 



body in the straightcst line possible while every 
attempt that human art could devise to facilitate 
that end would only have the effect of deranging 
this spontaneous effort of nature 

 if we examine with attention the operations 
of the human intellect we shall find that they are 
like those of every thing which we include under the 
general term nature perfectly uniform and con 
sistent if we wanted for instance to convince 
a savage from terra del fuego that a thing cannot 
both be and not be at the same moment we must 
set about it in a similar manner that we should to 
prove it to an infant locke or hume an exami 
nation of the languages of the most savage races 
will prove that they are fundamentally constructed 
on the same principles as our own and let it not be 
imagined that this is a trifling fact for only those 
who have reflected on language are aware of its 
complicated and exquisite mechanism uniformity 
in languages could not exist if the mode of proceed 
ing of the intellect was not fixed and invariable 
there is therefore but one form of intellect com 
mon to mankind but individuals and races will be 
found to possess it in different degrees that this 
fact as well as the extraordinary address of the 
intellect in the employment of language can admit 
of no dispute will be evident by attending to what 
i am about to sav 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

 in every instance that can be produced in 
which we use the word because we by its means 
give a reason for the action or state that is the sub 
ject of what we are talking about sometimes it may 
be convenient to express the reason that moved us to 
act and we then term such a reason the motive 
hence it is evident that the notion of a reason is 
always involved in the sentence that assigns either 
the cause or motive while the effect or act is 
equally involved in another sentence a child will 
assign a reason for its actions and say i sat down 
because was tired and similar phrases and yet 
the profoundest philosophers have been completely 
mystified by their own ingenuity the moment they 
have attempted to investigate the question the 
real fact is that the intellect is guided in some way 
that always enables it to effect its purpose when 
left to its natural efforts and is almost always 
thwarted the instant it is interrogated or called upon 
to give up a secret of which it knows no more than 
the bird does of the unerring instinct which instructs 
it to build its nest now if we analyse the sentence 
given above it will be at once admitted that we 
have a pure case of cause and effect combined 
with a reason and a consequence 

reason and cause i was tired 

consequence and effect i sat down 

 in this instance there is no mention of a 



of cause and effect 

 thing or object and that which constitutes the 
reason and cause is the phrase i was tired while 
the sentence sat dmvn is its consequence and 
effect which likewise it will be allowed are not 
things or objects we now see why cause and 
effect must necessarily be related for every thing 
we assign as a reason must necessarily be connected 
with that which it is intended to explain one 
sentence therefore is the reason and cause and 
the other the consequence and effect but it will 
be as well to give a few more examples to put this 
point beyond all doubt and these i shall arrange 
under the wellknown heads of action being and 
suffering 

action 

the deer tremble because the lion roars 

reason and cause the lion roars 
consequence and effect the deer tremble 

the window is broken because the boy flung a 
stone at it 

reason and cause the boy flung a stone 

at the window 
consequence and effect the window is broken 

being 
the lion devoured the man because he was hungry 

reason and cause the lion was hungry 
consequence and effect the lion devoured the 

man 
k 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

the boy whips his top because he is fond of play 

reason and cause the boy is fond of play 
consequence and effect the boy whips his top 

suffering 

the iron grows hot because it is hammered 

reason and cause the iron is hammered 
consequence and effect the iron grows hot 

the ball rebounds because it is struck 

reason and cause the ball is struck 

consequence and effect the ball rebounds 

in all the foregoing instances it is the whole sen 
tence that stands for reason and cause or conse 
quence and effect as the case may be 

 having conducted the reader so far i pro 
ceed to show him what are the correlations of 
reason cause and motive reason gives rise to a 
consequence cause is a specific kind of reason and 
has its effect but motive is a particular kind or 
variety of cause which produces an act so every 
motive is a cause and both it and cause are rea 
sons to determine therefore in a definite and 
precise manner whether any given case is that of 
reason cause or motive we have only to remem 
ber whether the leading sentence implies action 
being or suffering if it do not it is a reason 
unconnected with any notion of cause and its con 
sequence will likewise bear evidence of the fact by 



of cause and effect 

not implying a change which is the real meaning of 
every effect and such instances can only occur in 
scientific demonstration on the other hand a 
reason that is conjoined with a cause always con 
tains an instance of action being or suffering as 
may be seen in the examples already given and 
motive and act are the same as cause and effect 
but can only be applied to a rational being this 
particular kind of cause will be clearly compre 
hended by an example 

motive william was desirous of revenge 
act william killed thomas 

 the foregoing instances will be sufficient 
to explain the nature of the difference between 
reasons causes and motives but it must not be 
forgotten that many reasons causes or motives 
may combine to give rise to but one consequence 
effect or act to prove this and to show that 
cause never means a thing or object though 
every one of these may stand in that relation i 
may suppose an historian to give an account of the 
french revolution he might state in great detail 
all the grievances real and imaginary which the 
nation had endured and then he might sum up the 
whole in the following words these were the 
causes that led to effect the temporary subversion of 
monarchy in france and this example will i think 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

remove any remaining doubts if they exist from 
the mind of the reader as to the nature of these 
relations and he will likewise be aware that 
though the term reason and consequence has been 
heretofore overlooked it is as much entitled to a 
local habitation and a name as the hackneyed and 
misunderstood phrase l cause and effect which has 
solely obtained such exclusive currency through the 
misconceptions of metaphysicians and is as subor 
dinate to reason and consequence as a branch is to 
the trunk from which it springs when we ask 
what is the cause of that effect we only demand 
what is the particular reason of that effect 
a fact that may help to convince those that are still 
doubtful of the abstract character of cause and 
effect for i suppose no one will contest the abs 
tract sense of the word reason the four follow 
ing relations are all equally subordinate to reason 
and consequence 

of motive and act and motive and result 

 so much has been said of motive and act in 
explaining the two preceding relations that it will 
require but a few words on the present occasion to 
complete what i have to say this particular kind 
of cause implied by motive may have two conse 
quences according to the mode of proceeding of the 
agent if a mother destroy her child by neglecting 



of cause and effect 

to nourish it the motive has its correlation re 
sult but if she were to produce the same effect 
by violence the correlation of the motive would 
then be act that is the omission of her duty as a 
parent gives birth to result and the commission of 
violence to act hence in speaking of this rela 
tion we must say motive and act or motive and 
result according as we are aware of the reason 
that has moved the agent to one or the other 

of origin and end 

 the notion of a first cause contains in 
itself the assertion of a beginning hence the deity 
is often spoken of under such a term when the word 
origin would be more appropriate and we ought 
for the same reason to employ its correlation endj 
in preference to final cause every case of agency 
and act as well as of source and product may be 
considered in relation to cause and effect as 
origin and end the idiom of our language may 
sometimes require us to employ the word begin 
ning in preference to origin 

td of agency and act 

 when we speak of any operation in nature 
or art without reference to a particular agent we 
employ the word agency and we can then con 
sider it in relation to the act that results which is 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

its correlation this relation is often substituted 
for that of cause and effect but quite erroneously 
for the latter only expresses abstract agency while 
the former though used in a general sense always 
indicates agency that is physical 

of source and product 

 so intimately are the six relations i am 
now explaining connected together in our minds 
that we are continually substituting them for one 
another thus the deity as the great source of 
the universe is continually represented as its cause 
and we speak of the universe as the effect but as 
an effect only means a change we should be more 
correct in saying that it was a product which pro 
ceeded from him as its source for every production 
must be contained in its source and it was this fact 
that misled the hindu metaphysicians into the error 
of confounding source and product with cause and 
effect the word source has been borrowed 
from the french language and loses it real sense of 
fountain or spring in the figurative use to which it 
is applied in this relation and the same may be 
said of product 

 i have now given the six relations com 
plete and those that may still contend that the 

 m see and of note b of the appendix 



of cause ard effect 

words cause and effect mean objects things or 
persons must be prepared to maintain the same 
opinion with regard to reason motive origin 
agency and source as well as consequence re 
sult end and act if they wish to pass for consistent 
though erroneous reasoners 

of causation and causality 

 the word causation by its etymology im 
plies the act of causing or making to do and cau 
sality the state of being causal the first is more 
particularly employed by english and the latter by 
french metaphysicians though by both in cases 
exactly similar but the import they have in the 
minds of those employing them if they have any 
i have found it very difficult nay impossible to 
comprehend they are only alluded to here to show 
the very vague and indistinct manner in which 
words of the first importance in reasoning are used 
and the little hope therefore there must exist of 
their being comprehended to any useful purpose 
by those who read the works in which they are 
found had those who discussed the question of 
cause and effect known its true nature they never 
would have employed either the word causation or 
causality their use of the word causation shows 
that it was meant to imply physical agency which 
has nothing whatever to do with the relation of 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

cause and effect and they were led into this mis 
take as i before said by the verb to cause which 
means to effect as an agent 

 before quitting this subject therefore it 
will be as well to inquire into the origin of this 
mistake neither in the greek sanscrit bengali 
nor hindustani any more than in the arabic or 
persian languages does there exist a verb with 
the exact sense we imply by to cause our english 
verb is undoubtedly derived from the french causer 
and this last in all probability has been formed 
from causo which dr johnson assigns as the origi 
nal stem of causation and says it is low latin if 
this be the case it was not then till that language 
had been barbarized and its genuine spirit forgotten 
that this most illogical term was introduced and 
most likely by some of the schoolmen it has of 
course taken too deep root to be now discarded 
from the philosophical terms of european reasoners 
but whoever employs any one of its derivatives 
such as causation causator causative or causable 
should ever be alive to the misconceptions into 
which its use may lead him the words causal 
and causality derived from low latin must be 
equally guarded against whenever they relate to 
physical instead of abstract agency the tendency 
of the mind to connect this relation with personal 
agency is shown in the use of atto in the sense of 



of cause and effect 

causer which is likewise countenanced by the san 
scrit hetukas and the arabic musabbib the con 
i fusion of mind which has led to these mistakes 
seems therefore to be common to all mankind but 
no arab would say like ourselves wno was the 
cause of it but wiio was the causer of it 

 for the length to which the remarks on 
this important subject have extended i feel i can 
not excuse myself better than by quoting the words 
of hume 

 and what stronger instance can be produced 
of the surprising ignorance and weakness of the 
understanding than the present for surely if 
there be any relation among objects x which it 
imports to us to know perfectly it is that of cause 
and effect on this are founded all our reasonings 
concerning matter of fact or existence by means 
of it alone we attain any assurance concerning 
objects which are removed from the present 
testimony of our memory and senses the only 
immediate utility of all sciences is to teach us how 
to control and regulate future events by their 
causes our thoughts and inquiries are therefore 
every moment employed about this relation yet 

 here hume is again incorrect in supposing an object can stand 
in the relation of effect though it may in that of cause for it is but 
the change produced in an object by something else which the mind 
conceives to stand in the relation of cause that constitutes the effect 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

so imperfect are the ideas which we form concern 
ing it that it is impossible to give any just defini 
tion of a cause except what is drawn from some 
thing extraneous and foreign to it 

 it may assuredly be said with the greatest 
truth that metaphysical writers so far from clear 
ing up the difficulties of the subject have only per 
plexed it and even contributed to the notion that 
the human understanding is under the influence 
of some mysterious principles or agency that set 
reason at defiance the attempt of brown to 

 sr essays vol ii pp the last sentence proves that 
hume had not given the subject the attention it deserved and he was 
avowedly ignorant that a cause is an abstract relation otherwise he 
would not have uttered the last phrase of the above sentence no 
modern writer was a greater realist than hume nor had any one a 
more crude or popular notion of the true value of words his meta 
physical works teem with proofs of this assertion take the following 
example from section xv part iii vol i of his work on human 
nature no objects are contrary to each other but existence and non 
existence in this example we have two abstractions both of which 
are termed objects and the last of them implying privation so that 
inexistence is itself an object that is the not being anything consti 
tutes a supposition to be something this is the wisdom that was set 
up in opposition to the absurdities of the schoolmen yet possibly it 
will continue to delight mankind much better than any thing i can 
say for as hume himself has well remarked tis not reason which 
carries the prize but eloquence and no man needs ever despair ofyain 
ing proselytes to the most extravagant hypothesis who has art enough to 
represent it in any favourable colours 

 have not deemed it necessary to make any remarks on brown s 
work on cause and effect though he has treated the question so 

elaborately 



of cause and effect 

clear up this point is a remarkable proof to what 
an extent human ingenuity may be exerted and 
how much may be said to no purpose in the 
instances i have produced it must be seen that the 
understanding though always right in practice is 
invariably wrong in theory the moment it attempts 
to account for its own mode of proceeding a fact 
that agrees with what goldsmith said with so much 
felicity and humour of burke s brother 

 here lies honest william whose heart was a mint 
while the owner ne er knew half the good that was in t 
the pupil of impulse it forc d him along 
his conduct still right with his argument wrong 
still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam 
the coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home 
would you ask for his merits alas he had none 
what was good was spontaneous his faults were his own 

 such is the nature of prejudice and early 
bias that i fear the reader may still be induced to 

elaborately because it is entirely founded on the misapprehension 
upon which i have said so much in the preceding observations 
namely the mistake that this relation exists between the phenomena 
of nature it is surprising that so many acute and able men should 
have fallen into this common and vulgar error one from which they 
would certainly have escaped had they known any thing of the true 
nature of language brown s disquisitions arc peculiarly marked by 
those characteristics for which the metaphysicians of his nation have 
ever been distinguished division and xumivision it is evident that 
such a process can in no way remedy a fallacy nor convert error into 
truth see sir james macintosh s dissertation on ethical phio

relapse into his old convictions as often as he wishes 
to represent the notion of cause and effect to his 
own mind if this should be the case i have no other 
resource left for him than to recommend him to 
read over again the preceding remarks and to reflect 
upon them for though it has been happily said 

 a man convinced against his will 
is of the same opinion still 

yet i do hope that the obvious and irrefragable 
proofs i have adduced with regard to this contested 
relation will place it in its true light for ever 

of matter space time movement and force 

 the reader has been made aware that all 
abstractions relate to what is general or particular 
see the words space time move 
ment and force are all abstractions employed in a 
general sense and the word matter f is likewise a 



 the etymology of the word matter deserves mention more 
particularly as it proves how consistent language is in its greatest 
changes we derive the word matter from the french matiere a cor 
ruption of the latin materia and this and the greek fjerpov both 
descend from the sanscrit matram we have two corruptions of the 
original sanscrit term in the saxon portion of our language namely 
mother the feculent matter that forms in vinegar and beer and mud 
the slimy matter deposited by water the root of ma tram is ma 
measure and the sanscrit termination tram is the same as the greek 
rpov the word matra in the feminine seems to have implied the 
first measure of space and is therefore with the hindus equi 
valent 



of cause and effect 

generalization though it relates to what is concrete 
he has seen that whatever is general has no existence 
except by the means of words to investigate 
therefore the nature of the foregoing terms we 
must look to their use as particular words and see 
if they have any better claim to reality first then 
taking the generalization to which we give the 
name of matter as it is not employed in a parti 
cular sense we must substitute a body in its place 
and as it is inseparable from space we must also 
take a space into consideration along with it 

of a body and a space 

 a body is either a single atom or it is an 
aggregation of many atoms i will not here enter 
upon the question of infinite divisibility but take 
it for granted that there is a point at which all 
things begin to be and which the greeks with 
great felicity of expression called an atom or that 
which is indivisible when therefore we think of a 

valent to the atom of the greeks in the institutes attributed to 
menu all nature is said to be made up of matras which arc declared 
to be minute or subtile those who think that the latin materia is 
derived from mater a mother and therefore means mother substance 
are quite in error for the latin mater and the greek uttvo are both 
derived from the sanscrit matri a mother which is radically distinct 
from matram here we see that the corruptions of matram and 
matri are parallel in sound and that both words have undergone 
similar changes in their descent the same analogy holds through 
nearly all the teutonic languages 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

body composed of one or more atoms we are from 
the very condition of such a conception obliged to 
admit that it occupies a space as large as itself 
if we have supposed a body composed of a single 
atom we may imagine another of the same kind 
and having done that we may again imagine these 
two little bodies to approach one another the 
instant we have had this conception we have called 
into existence in our own minds the notion of a 
space and of a movement of one or of both the 
atoms a time in which it was accomplished and 
a force by which they were impelled together 
now this process which we have merely fancied 
we see take place at every moment either in bodies 
that are quite inanimate or in such as are endowed 
with locomotion indeed while i have been writ 
ing these few lines i have seen my pen move in a 
certain space i am sensible it has occupied a cer 
tain time and that it has been impelled by my 
hand with a certain force now my pen is a real 
thing a body that leaves no doubt of its existence 
on my mind it is therefore termed concrete and 
is capable of being appreciated by all my senses 
but when i come to inquire into the nature of its 
inseparable adjuncts i am no longer certain of their 
separate and real existence i feel that to talk of a 
space i should never have had the least notion of 
it without the existence of my own body or of some 
material thing which moved movement therefore 



op a odv and a space 

is essential to the notion of space the definition 
of a body is that it is that which prevents what is 
similar to itself from occupying the space it fills 
and the definition of a space is that it is that 
which can be filled by a body of its own dimen 
sions they are both therefore united in the same 
conviction of the mind but though we could have 
had no notion of a space without the existence of 
bodies we must be aware that we can see many 
bodies in a given space and that it is therefore not 
full that is not impervious we can see these bodies 
move to and from and cross one another and they 
thus prove that the space was not filled by unyield 
ing matter the whole field or circuit of vision is 
as it were but one large image in which we may 
occasionally see many smaller images bodies 
moving in various directions these and their 
movements raise in us the conviction of a certain 
space such as we derive from sight but that 
which we obtain from touch we possess from the 
consciousness that we can and do move our hands 
and fingers freely at our will that a space may be 
enlarged we learn by moving our eyes head or 
bodies and from the conviction that we can do so 
in any direction we acquire the belief that the 
space might if we could but move ourselves at 
pleasure be extended without limitation 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

of a time 

 the reader is aware that time being a 
generalization has no existence except as a sound 
to understand its true nature therefore we must 
examine it as a particular term when we see 
two bodies move with unequal velocity in the same 
direction we are convinced that one reaches its 
destination quicker than the other but though we 
saw this if we had no language we could have no 
notion of time but with the aid of language we 
have that general notion yet still it does not tell 
us how much quicker one body can move than 
another when however language has a word for a 
second a minute an hour a day a week a month 
a year a century c we are able to assign exactly 
the degree in which one reached a certain point 
before the other for as all these periods of time can 
be called one so they may be called two or any other 
number now one may be halved and that half 
may be subdivided in thought ad infinitum but 
only in thought when mankind began to observe 
and to reason they found themselves obliged to 
have some certain standard for quicker and slower 
and they fixed on those two great bodies that move 
in the heavens called the sun and the moon the 
apparent revolution of the first they called a day 
and the complete revolution of the other a month 
by dividing the first they had hours and they had 



op a time 

weeks by doing the same for the second the divi 
sion of the hours gave them minutes and the sub 
division seconds now when they had to express 
the difference in the velocity between any two 
moving bodies they could say it occupied so many 
hours so many minutes or so many seconds for 
every one of these expressions was borrowed from 
the divisions of a great circle each of them 
therefore constituted a certain time and when 
they said an act took up such or such a short time 
they only asserted that the difference was equal to a 
certain portion of the sun s revolution that is to say 
of a day now from all this it is clear that as a 
particular term a time must always mean a cer 
tain portion of the sun or moon s revolution or the 
movement of some other body as the hands of a 
clock for instance space and time therefore 
though always classed together ought to be kept 
quite distinct we may speak of matter and space 
just as we would of sword and scabbard because 
they are concomitant notions but it will be evident 

 this assertion is not the less true because the egyptians 
divided the circle into to agree with their earliest notion of the 
length of the year that is of the number of days in which they con 
ceived the sun to m ake his annual circuit so the chinese divide the 
circle into i which is inconvenient though it be nearer the true 
length of the year the notions of time and space being conjoint and 
coetaneous they naturally act and re act upon one another in the mind 
and if the orbit which the sun was supposed to move in suggested the 
number of the degrees of the circle the division of those on the other 
hand gave the hours and their subdivision the minutes and seconds 

i 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

that any specified time is only the name for the 
movement of a body in a certain space yet such 
is the influence of language over our minds that we 
even talk of a space of time as if the latter were 
something real of which we could separate a portion 
from the general mass kant has been so far misled 
by language as to consider time and space as forms 
of the mind and he terms the first an internal and 
the second an external sense this is the very 
basis of his metaphysical system see 
mathematicians are equally deceived by the nature 
of language and when they say that the velocity is 
always proportional to the time of descent they uncon 
sciously only assert that one regulated movement 
bears a certain proportion to another regulated 
movement or that the descent of a body in space 
bears an exact proportion in accordance with the law 
of gravitation to the movement of the sun of a clock 
or merely of a pendulum i do not however mean to 
say or imply that time and movement should not 
be distinguished by separate terms my only object 
is to show that they are fundamentally identical 
when we ask what is the time we just do the same 
as if we put the question how much has the sun 
moved practically the term time is indispensable 
in preventing ambiguity and the evidence derived 
from all languages will show that nature in 
tended we should be under the delusion of believing 
them to be distinct notions or existences 



of a time 



 when we reflect that we can always say 
that any event has had a before and after we shall 
be singularly struck by the foregoing conclusions 
yet let us remember that these very words are 
borrowed from the notion of a space in which we 
see objects so placed if then there exist no such 
thing as time general or particular how is the 
above succession of acts to be conceived here the 
reader in suggesting this contradiction between 
sense and reason has laid bare one of the most 
mysterious parts of nature one which immedi 
ately recalls our attention once more to that of 
matter and space were we to push these two 
questions to the same extreme that i have done 
with regard to time i should violate the condition 
upon which the whole of these observations has 
been ventured namely the objective reality of nature 
such an attempt would only convince us how delu 
sive is the nature of every thing that arises from our 
sensations and we should find the steadfast earth 
recede from under us the starry host vanish from 
sight the heavens depart as a scroll that is rolled 
together and all our firmest convictions would be 
shaken to their basis nor would aught remain to the 
reeling understanding but the bewildering belief 
that nothing is certain and that there is neither 
before nor after in time or space neither move 
ment nor force in matter or spirit nor fulness nor 
void in nature and that all is but a vision of 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

which no account can be given by either sense or 
reason it is evident from the foregoing reasoning 
that 

 a time is only another name for a specified 
movement of some body that has been agreed upon as 
a standard and that time as a general term is a 
mere sound 



of a movement 

 the next question for consideration relates 
to movement which must likewise be considered 
in its particular point of view a particular move 
ment has no more existence than that which we call 
general for i movement is merely an abstract 
word to understand therefore what it means 
we must refer to the verb to move from which it is 
derived matter we see can move but when we 
abstract and form the notion of movement from it 
we have a word that merely deludes us but the 
verb to move being sometimes neuter its pre 
sent participle as such is capable of serving as 
an adjective and we can talk and think of a moving 
body of any kind movement therefore that is the 
moving state stands in the same relation to body 

 i have uniformly employed the word movement instead of 
motion because it has the advantage of being referred to the verb to 
move see on motion 



of a movement 

as redness or any quality does for as there is no 
such thing as redness though we can talk and think 
of a red coat a red cow c so there is no such thing 
as movement though we can likewise talk and think 
of a moving body such as a falling star a flowing 
stream c the wellknown sophism or rather 
fallacy of zeno which is known by the name of 
achilles and by which he attempted to prove that 
there was no such thing as movement is a proof how 
the mind of the most acute man maybe deceived even 
independently of the misconceptions that arise out 
of language that fallacious proposition remained 
undetected till very modern times yet it appears 
to me that it required no mathematical process to 
show its absurdity for even the evidence of his 
sight might have convinced zeno that one body can 
pass another and that to pass is only the name for a 
particular kind of movement gtand this must be 
relatively true whether the world has a real or an 
ideal existence 



of a force 

 the word force from its general employ 
ment in mathematical reasoning requires particular 
attention like space time and movement with 
which it is inseparably linked it is only a general 
and abstract term and as such is a mere sound 
the word has been derived from the french 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

language in which it was formed from the latin 
fors strong and it therefore by its origin means 
strength but from the multitude of terms we have 
in our heterogeneous language it is generally reser 
ved for employment in the abstract sciences as a 
particular term a force has no more reality than 
the general one and when we speak of the force of 
the torrent or that the rock rolled down with a force 
that nothing could withstand we have not conferred 
any more reality on it than it possessed in its general 
character when employed in mathematics it has a 
purely abstract sense and then expresses nothing but 
an ideal quantity that becomes the subject of calcula 
tion a quantity to be real must refer to something 
in nature but it too frequently happens that ques 
tions purely physical are mixed up with those that 
are abstract by such as have neglected to look into the 
nature of language and this has been already shown 
 in the case of newton himself with mathe 
maticians quantity always means something real it 
is on this account that force momentum and ve 
locity are always understood by them to be realities 
if a mathematician took it into his head to investi 
gate the amount of the several integral and fractional 
quantities of nothing he might represent each by 
figures or symbols and arrive at a right conclusion 
upon the data he had assumed yet by such a pro 
cess he would only have amused himself for the 
time and his nothing would really have stood for 



of a force 



something as a figurative expression the word 
force is of very common use and it then implies a 
reality as when we hear that a general sent a force 
to the relief of a town these observations will be 
sufficient to enable the reader to form a correct no 
tion of this much misunderstood term 

 from the tenour of the foregoing remarks 
it is evident that we have only two realities instead 
of five that is to say we have matter and space 
but as soon as we turn language into abstractions 
the whole five make their appearance by the addi 
tion of time movement and force this is worthy 
of consideration because we see that language itself 
helps to complete the plan of nature and proves 
itself to have been an instrument intended for the 
full representation and comprehension of the phe 
nomena we witness around us indeed stript of 
language the intellect is a mere waste luxuriating 
in barrenness though capable of the richest pro 
ducts 



 m berkeley bishop of cloyne asserted that there was as much 
proof for the reality of grace as of force had this most worthy man 
known the nature of the abstractions against which he raised his 
voice so loudly he would have spared himself the remark as he 
would then have known that all we can truly say is that bodies 
may be made to force or that by supplication god may be rendered 
gracious faith too when released from its abstract nature im 
plies that its possessor is faithful that is truly believes what he 
has been tawjht minute philosopher dialogue vii ix x 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

 from what has been just said it is evi 
dent that there is an intimate and inseparable union 
between these five fundamental generalizations 
thus the movement of matter gives the notion of 
space and its movement in space that of time 
movement is immediately connected with the notion 
of force as implying that from which it has received 
its impulsion these generalizations are all pri 
mary and constitute the basis of any supposition 
connected with nature 



of power 

 power is a word in universal use and per 
haps there is not one which is oftener employed in 
more various senses but they are all abstract ex 
cept that for which i have exclusively reserved it in 
this work namely that of a real agent as when we 
speak of the power caloric passing from the fire 
into the boiler of a steamengine in this sense it 

 locke and hume were both realists and employed the word 
power without any suspicion of the ambiguous meanings it conveys 
with both of them it implied force energy efficacy c but as 
these words are mere abstractions they must be referred if we wish to 
know what they really import to something that forces is energetic 
efficacious c and such a something would be found to be a concrete 
or physical agent locke distinguishes power into active and passive 
passive power resolves itself therefore into something that is non 
energetic intfficacious c that is something that is powerful enough 
to be powerless such are the absurdities the ablest of mankind may 
fall into from ignorance of the nature of language 



of power 

unequivocally implies something real and is no 
longer used as an abstraction in a plural sense as 
in the mechanical powers it is employed figura 
tively and the reader therefore must not be misled 
to think that it has in this case a concrete sense 
the mechanical powers which are commonly con 
sidered as six are the lever and balance the 
pulley the wheeland axle the wedge the inclined 
plane and the screw which are contrived for the 
convenient and economical application of the real 
essence power as by their means there is the least 
possible waste of this greatest desideratum in labour 

 mankind from the obscurity of the subject 
and trusting merely to their senses have considered 
every body in movement as a force but if we 
examine the matter a little closer we must be con 
vinced that the body in movement is as it were 
but the mask of that which forces every body 
that moves must have been impelled by something 
now every one by his own feelings is aware that 
according to the degree of strength he possesses at 
the moment and which is always varying he is able 
to impel a body with more or less velocity it is 
clear in this case that as his weight has not dimi 
nished the movement cannot simply depend upon 
his will and his body we say by the mere use of 
popular language when we feel ourselves weakened 
after an effort that we are exhausted now here 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

we have really said what is perfectly true without 
any figure of speech and we are deprived of that 
which enabled us a few seconds before to impel 
bodies in various directions we have therefore by 
our efforts lost something that from long experi 
ence we know cannot return without rest that 
something therefore which we can employ when 
we possess it is a reality though quite invisible 
and imponderable 

to this mysterious thing men have agreed to 
give the name of power a word originally abstract 
but which in this case has by its use lost its abs 
tract sense and has been converted as often as it 
is used for this purpose into a concrete term 
when mathematicians therefore calculate any 
force though their ciphers and symbols merely 
represent what is abstract namely number and 
quantity they do really calculate the quantity of 
power that is in and has been communicated by 
another body living or otherwise to the one which 
they imagine for the time in movement 

 the main object of the present investiga 
tion is to prepare the way for the consideration of 
the real nature of the agency which actuates the 
universe power by itself would be utterly unequal 
to the accomplishment of any effect in nature or art 
if it were not directed by some intelligence the 
truth of such a view will i think be rendered 



of power 

evident by the following remarks which i printed 
on a former occasion 

 it may not however be without its use 
to carry this inquiry a few steps further and to con 
sider the unanswerable objection that attends upon 
materialism with regard to the doctrine of power 
the atheist considers that power is inherent in mat 
ter and inseparable from it and that it is through 
its own energy that this universe with all its won 
derful variety has arisen perhaps the best answer 
to the groundlessness of this assumption will be to 
consider the nature of the power with which the 
materialist endows matter and this maybe done in 
a few words power must be either something real 
or something ideal that is it must be either con 
crete or abstract in the case of a cannonball the 
power passes from the gunpowder by its explosion 
into the ball it is therefore clear that it is capa 
ble of augmentation and diminution and that it 
consequently can be transferred from one body to 
another power therefore it must be seen is not 
an inherent and inseparable property of matter 
but it may be replied that by power is meant 
nothing that is transferable but merely an inherent 
energy which is in matter and which by certain 
mechanical arrangements enables one thing to give 
impulse to another this last explanation implies 
that it is nothing real that is meant by power but 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

something ideal and to this last supposition there 
fore the remainder of the argument must be directed 
power and energy if they do not mean some 
thing real mean nothing at all as they are mere 
abstract terms employed by the mind for the con 
venience of reasoning and the materialist in using 
them without a material sense has really in this 
instance changed himself into an idealist and is so 
inconclusive a reasoner as to admit of operations 
that stand in the relation of effects and yet to 
deny the existence of the indispensable thing which 
can alone produce what are to stand in the relation 
of causes but as there may be some materialists 
that do not hold the doctrine that power is inherent 
in matter though they deny the existence of an 
allwise mind rendering it the instrument of his 
will in producing the phenomena we witness around 
us the following remarks are intended as an answer 
to such a supposition 

 power being admitted to exist as a real 
something it may be asked what it is that directs or 
guides it into the production of all the exquisite 
forms we see in nature every individual has a 
certain degree of power at his command still ex 
perience shows us that there must be a most feli 
citous combination of circumstances such as fine 

 s by the word material it is meant that they imply something 
real however subtile and not an abstraction 



of power 

organization years of instruction and application to 
a particular branch of study before he who is him 
self assumed to be a mere production of chance is 
fitted to give even an ordinary and lifeless imita 
tion of those graceful and beautiful objects which 
according to the supposition of the atheist has 
arisen fortuitously that is without a directing mind 

 the power possessed by every individual 
is exhausted after a certain degree of effort and 
sleep and repose are both necessary for its renewal 
we find that a watch will not go till it is wound 
up that is till a certain degree of power is commu 
nicated to it by what process therefore is it that 
the individual is as it were wound up or renovated 
for new efforts repose and sleep which are mere 
states of quiescence could not do it there must 
consequently have been some agent at work which 
has so to say recharged him with power for the 
labours of the coming day that agent the theist 
calls god the atheist terms it repose a mere abs 
tract term and therefore devoid of reality he 
has consequently assigned an effect that is without 
a cause merely from his ignorance of the nature of 
language 

 if it be argued that the power which had 
been exhausted by effort returns to the individual 
by the simple process of sleep it will be only 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

necessary to bear in mind that what has life must 
possess more power than that which is inanimate 
consequently if there was a transfer of power by the 
ordinary laws of nature it would pass from that 
which is alive into that which is not that is if it 
tended to an equalization it would quit and not enter 
the body but so far is this from being the case 
that we find that the body receives an increase of 
power during sleep there remains therefore but 
one inference to be drawn from this fact namely 
that the power of the sleeping body has been re 
plenished by some agency vital function could not 
be assigned as the reason since function itself as 
an action must require an actor or agent for its 
production and it could therefore be only the 
medium by which the end was effected 

 but it may be said that if the food was 
flesh the power was transferred from it to the indi 
vidual who ate it and though this must be true to 
a certain extent as experience proves still at the 
best it could be but the vehicle of the power and 
cannot do away with the necessity of some agency 
by which the transfer was effected and does not ac 
count for the means by which it entered the animal 
from whom the flesh was taken it may perhaps 
be replied that he got it from the herbage on 
which he fed but if so whence did the herbage 
acquire it now all this shows that in each step 



of power 



of the progression we must suppose a conscious and 
efficient though invisible agency as the prime 
source of all these natural operations these inex 
plicable difficulties of atheism have evidently beset 
the human mind from the earliest periods of its in 
vestigations as will be seen by the following extracts 
from the book of job one of the most sublime 
compositions that have come down to us from an 
cient times where speaking of the agency of the 
deity it is said 

behold i go forward but he jy not there and back 
ward but i cannot perceive him 

on the left hand wiikrp in doth work but i cannot 
behold film he hideth himself on the riglit hand that i 
cannot see him 



of motion 

 the word motion has very often the sense 
of power in the way in which it is frequently used 
for people speak of a body as having motion in it 
implying that it possesses at the moment something 
that has the means of moving it from the many 
senses in which the word is used and to prevent all 
ambiguity have invariably substituted movement 
for it to imply that attach no other than an abs 
tract meaning to the notion i intend to convey and

because it has the advantage of being referrible to 
the verb to move in our own language 



of form 

 if we consider matter as a primary gene 
ralization concrete we shall find that there are 
other generalizations abstract which being de 
pendent upon it we must consider as secondary 
the first of these is form which without matter 
could have had no existence as a general abs 
tract term it has of course no reality and it re 
mains to be discovered whether it has better claims 
when considered as a particular abstraction 

 when a man without a knowledge of lan 
guage as one dumb for instance examines any 
object with his fingers he remarks if it be of 
suitable dimensions that it terminates on every 
side if he uses his eyes for the same purpose he 
observes the same thing if he can get a proper view 
of it when he has done this it is perhaps supposed 
that he has got a notion of its form this however 
is not the case for even after all this effort he is 
only aware that it is similar or not to some other 
object with which he is already acquainted he 
may even have a sense of the beautiful and be cap 
tivated by its appearance and yet not be able to 
imagine why we will suppose language to be 



of form g 

imparted to him he is now able to say but not to 
think that the form which pleased him was very 
beautiful all he really can think is that the ob 
ject that is the image it has made in his mind is 
very beautiful for the form of any thing is merely 
in the word why the object pleased him so much 
is one of those ultimate facts of which no account 
can be given and all that can be said is that it 
was so designed that the presence of certain objects 
in nature and only those in nature are calculated 
to give inexpressible pleasure and the greater as 
they are more perfect and observed with more 
attention apparently as if the sense of beauty were 
improved or better awakened by its employment 
if the form were any thing real it would be capa 
ble of separation and duration apart from the object 
in which it is conceived to exist the truth is that 
the intellect receives in the case i have supposed a 
certain amount of information of the external object 
if by touch in succession but if by sight at once 
and completely the sensations in the first case 
have to be put together by the intellect before it 
can construct the whole notion of the object sup 
posing it to be too large to be grasped but in the 
last supposition there is an image raised at once in 
the mind which is considered the same as the 
object felt by the fingers because we have a con 
viction of the concurring and cooperating efforts of 
the senses as instruments of the individual thinking 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

self but in no way is the form either made or 
conceived by the intellect but is totally dependent 
upon language for its existence the mention of 
form suggests in this place the utility of drawing 
the reader s attention to the feeling he has of objects 
in his dreams he has in them an appearance 
of objects moving apparently in space and yet he 
must be aware that they occupy no space they 
are simply sensations and of the most mysterious 
kind these will convince him that the magni 
tude of the objects which he beholds when awake 
does not depend upon the size of the objects them 
selves but on a cause within himself and all that the 
external objects can determine is the relative size of 
one to the other depending on the degree of distance 
at which they are placed from him when we 
reflect on the wonderful combinations and the in 
vention displayed in our dreams we must be con 
vinced that they are among the most mysterious 
phenomena of existence the word form has a 
near resemblance to symmetry its delusive nature 
so far beguiled kant that as i before said 
 he considered time and space as forms of the 
mind these views show that 

 form is nothing but an intellectual pro 
perty see 



 

of number 

 we become acquainted with certain words 
at so early an age that we use them without ever 
inquiring how we came by them or indeed ever 
imagining that they could have cost the least effort 
in their invention number is one of the most re 
markable of these the bulk of mankind seem to 
think that the notion of number is quite obvious a 
little reflection will however convince us that this 
is not the fact it is indeed so far from being 
obvious that it is one of the grand criteria of the 
difference between man and the brute no animal 
is sensible of number if the fondest parent in the 
lower species is unknown to her deprived of all 
but one of her young however numerous she does 
not observe her loss while that one is left to her 
but deprive her of that solitary remnant of her 
progeny and she is for a time inconsolable it is 
therefore evident that she has no notion of number 
however selfevident the matter may seem to be to 
us but to comprehend this a little better let us 
suppose one of the human species even with the 
knowledge of language to have ten or eleven eggs 
before him exactly similar he would not without 
reckoning them be aware of the loss of a single egg 
even here then is an approximation though a 
distant one to the ignorance of irrational creatures 
the miser with all his love of gold must count his 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

ten pieces to be sure he has not lost one it be 
comes therefore a question as curious as it is 
interesting to inquire how mankind arrived at the 
knowledge of numbers that is at the means of com 
putation among many savage tribes it is common to 
find that they cannot reckon beyond five units and 
the remainder of mankind in general limit them 
selves to ten and then combine these together for 
the higher numbers but if i remember right the 
basques go as high as twenty and then increase by 
combination now it is obvious that in these three 
modes those who have respectively used them 
have been guided to the employment of each system 
by the fingers of one hand or of both hands and 
in the case of the biscayans they have added to these 
the number of their toes if then we say that each 
finger and each toe had a separate name which is 
of the highest probability in the infancy of society 
as we see that the languages of savages are re 
dundant in names for individual objects but nearly 
destitute of such as express general notions we 
may suppose for instance that the thumb of the 
right hand was called one the index finger two 
and so of the others all then that had to be done 
was to mention the name of the particular finger 
that was called one two or three for any number 
up to ten and then for fifteen for instance to say 
fiveten which in time was contracted into fifteen 
the rest were formed after the same analogy it 



of number 



may be thought that here at least we have no 
abstract words and that therefore numbers are 
exempt from the charge of implying nothing of 
themselves this at first sight appears plausible 
but if we remember that though we have employed 
the names of what were real namely the fingers 
the words we have thus borrowed have lost their 
original import and for their class we must not 
refer to their former but their present use which 
is to express a certain relation that the no 
tion of number is altogether a distinction of the 
mind must be evident from what i have already 
said with respect to the difference between the 
human race and brutes and being merely a gene 
ral term we must inquire into the origin of its par 
ticular notion which is the unit when the mind 
contrasts a single object with a multitude it arrives 
at the conception of one when it does the same 
with two three or more objects it feels that the 
distinction amounts to two three or more ones 
every number therefore how r ever high only implies 
so many units hence it is evident that the notion 
of number is merely relative and that it arises 
like that of other relations from an effort of the 
intellect which could only be accomplished by the 
aid of language deprive any being of the no 
tion of language and you would equally deprive 
him of all notion of numbers and other rela 
tions lie would still see objects before him as 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

clearly as formerly but he would have no more 
conception of number than an untaught man has of 
the properties of the circle when he looks at the 
ring on his finger devoid of the knowledge of 
numbers and their parent language man would 
merely be the most cunning of animals possessed 
however of these advantages he stands like a god at 
the head of creation wielding all the powers of 
nature for his pleasure and use and converting the 
surface of the earth into a garden stored with every 
convenience and contrivance that can conduce to his 
comfort and happiness with it likewise he is able 
to weigh the globe he inhabits and the other 
planets in an intellectual balance and to predict 
their revolutions and the return of the seasons 
without quitting his closet 

 a fancy exists among german metaphy 
sicians respecting an absolute unity which has been 
broached in modern times by f w schelling as 
i feel i cannot say any thing more to the purpose 
than i did on a former occasion i hope to be ex 
cused for quoting my own opinions an indulgence 
which i must claim for a similar reason in other 
places in these pages 

 it is worth while however to examine 
this new discovery of schelling s a little closer 
the idea of one is purely relative for it arises 



of number 

from the perception of the division of matter and 
so we say one two three parts c our ideas 
on this point are therefore perfectly clear and 
defined when however we transfer the notion 
from the forms of matter the only thing of 
which the senses afford us any information to that 
which is indefinite namely infinity and which 
we only know by inference it is certain we have 
fallen into a fallacy we cannot in the least release 
ourselves from this embarrassment by tacking to 
it another word such as absolute j for instance as 
the original materiality and numerical relation still 
remain even if we could by an effort of ima 
gination contemplate one single thing to the exclu 
sion of every thing else that thing would still be 
definite and as this idea supposes the existence 
of no other individual thing but the one contem 
plated the relation of number could never have 
presented itself to the mind and we should only 
have called that one thing by such a general term 
as thing spot figure c but even admitting that 
we did call it one and wished by language to show 
that it was released from all comparison it would 
still as the one thing contemplated and therefore 
comprehended by the mind be definite that is finite 
and not infinite this must prove that the term abso 
lute unity as applied to the divine essence is totally 
inapplicable if mankind therefore from the effect 
of daily use should receive this new term as one 



 of abstract general and particular terms 

perfectly applicable to the divine nature let no one 
smile if some future schelling some scion of tran 
scendentalism should go one step further and talk 
of an absolute half an absolute quarter c the 
term absolute unity is it appears to me altogether a 
fallacy as an attempt to improve upon the word 
unity y which we must from the constitution of our 
minds as individual beings attribute to the divine 
nature as often as we contemplate it in its agency 
as the creator and ruler of all things but neither 
unity nor absolute unity can we with philosophic 
accuracy attribute to the divine essence or god 
head which can be represented by no sign or sym 
bol of human invention it must be admitted of our 
worthy friends the germans with reference to meta 
physics that they do to parody the words of shak 
speare speak an infinite deal of nothing more 
than all other men in europe 

 t it becomes a question of the highest interest to ascertain 
whether the relation of number has entered into the plan upon which 
the universe has been contrived i hold back for the present some 
remarks that i have prepared on the subject number in common 
with all the other relations depends for its existence on the frame of 
our intellect if therefore we can establish the fact of a uniformity 
in the mode of action of divine and human intelligence a great 
advance is made in the knowledge of what seems almost beyond our 
finite comprehension and a harmony is established between man and 
the rest of creation that proves him to be part of a magnificent and 
extended plan all relations we have seen are but figments of the 
intellect which enable us to reason and it would follow therefore 
as a matter of inference that human reason is in accordance with 
divine intelligence differing not in kind but in its degree

of quantity 

 the notion of number naturally leads to 
that of quantity of which it is the higher generali 
zation because it includes measure as well as num 
ber the word quantity being derived from the 
latin quantus meaning how much and how many 
signifies hoivmuchness and how many ness the 
english language has this degree of definiteness 
over several others that it can distinguish between 
how much and how many as applied to both measure 
and number the french language for instance 
has but the one word combien for both purposes 
this affords an example of the great disadvantage 
attending the employment of comprehensive forms 
of expression every specific question should be 
discussed with specific terms otherwise a reason 
that would apply only to one particular view may 
incautiously be extended to that with which it has 
no relation thus as i have said before in 
the hindus by comprehending both cause and 
effect as well as source and product under the 
same term have been led into even greater mistakes 
than the metaphysicians of europe upon the points 
connected with these topics

of weight 

 when we take up a body in our hands 
we feel that it would fall to the ground if left to 
self but we can find others a feather or a soap 
bubble for instance that on the contrary will float 
of themselves in the air when we have observed 
this we express the fact by saying that the first was 
heavy and the two last light but as according to the 
genius of language we have a class of words which 
we call abstract that we employ when we reason 
we convert this word heavy into heaviness to agree 
with the others when we are desirous of knowing 
how heavy any body is we weigh it against another 
and then pronounce that it is of the same greater 
or less weight than that body still there is no 
such thing as absolute weight and all we have learnt 
by weighing it is that it is of a certain relative 
weight to another body when we do not speak 
of weight in the abstract we call it a weight and 
then it always refers to that of some particular 
object weight is only gravitation viewed and con 
sidered in a special light the remarks which 
follow on magnitude apply with equal force to 
weight 

of magnitude 

 when we contemplate a body we observe 
that it has among other properties that of being 



of magnitude 

larger or smaller than others with which we con 
trast it to the notion that arises in our minds 
after such a comparison we give the name of mag 
nitude greatstate but such a relation it is clear 
cannot exist in the object itself but in the mind 
contemplating it every object is only large or 
small relatively to some other and whatever is rela 
tive implies a mind that is capable of inferring the 
relation when we say therefore that any object 
has a certain size we can do no more than point out 
or produce another thing of the same size conse 
quently there is no such thing as absolute magni 
tude when therefore we ask what is the parti 
cular magnitude or size of any object we only de 
mand the name of the body to which it is equal be 
it our thumb an inch ourfoot c should it ex 
ceed or fall short of these respectively we have 
only to multiply or divide them as the case may 
require it is obvious that the question of magni 
tude is identical with that of matter and space 
and perhaps it may help to convince the reader how 
inscrutible these questions are and which have in 
truth puzzled philosophers ever since the first 
dawn of inquiry such investigations however 
have their use as they prove that everything in 
nature is relative and nothing absolute this 
inexplicable result joined to what i have said with 
regard to infinity and time will make the reflect 
ing mind fall back with wonder and astonishment 



 op abstract general and particular terms 

at the incomprehensible nature of the phenomena 
which we behold around us g so true is the pro 
found and beautiful sentiment of pascal that 
reason confounds the dogmatist and nature the 
sceptic 



of proportion 

 if we look at any object with attention we 
shall observe if it have parts that these parts can 
be compared with one another and each of these 
besides being capable of being contrasted with the 
others can likewise be compared with the entire 
object itself when we have so done we can say it 
has such and such proportions if it does not con 
tain separate parts or members we are then confined 
to the examination of its diameter in different direc 
tions and from this effort we draw our inference 
as to its proportions in all these processes of the 
intellect we have clearly only arrived at an infe 
rence and we thus feel that the notion of pro 
portion like that of form and other properties is 
truly a creation of the mind resulting from the em 
ployment of language 

 the incomprehensible nature of these topics to human reason 
is further pointed out in the appendix note d 



 



of scientific reasoning 

 the utmost we can learn from the pure 
sciences is the fact of the perfect agreement of their 
results with the actual phenomena of nature they 
can however teach us nothing as to the origin or 
the rationale of things still the demonstrations of 
science cannot but raise our minds to the conviction 
of a wondrous intelligence that must be the regu 
lating principle of all that we behold around us 
that every thing obeys laws established by perfect 
wisdom without any deviation is surely as edifying 
a conclusion as it is possible for humanity to arrive 
at and cannot but make us feel the dignity of our 
own nature at the very moment we are humbled 
by the contrast that we must unconsciously draw 
between ourselves and the omnipotent being to 
whom we are indebted for existence to be fitted 
for the contemplation of the spectacle of the universe 
is surely to have a high privilege and an important 
station in nature 



 of scientific reasoning 

of the laws of nature 

 it was not long even in the infancy of society 
before mankind observed that certain results always 
occurred under similar circumstances thus the fall 
of a stone or any other heavy body to the ground 
was soon taken as a matter of course such also 
was the case with the ascent of flame and smoke it 
is unnecessary to repeat here other familiar instances 
in which we always expect a recurrence of what we 
have observed before when such facts began to 
be reasoned upon they impressed the mind with the 
conviction that they had their undeviating uniformity 
from some presiding influence and as the word 
nature had become personified as the great agent 
of the universe every result of the kind was said to 
take place by a law she had established hence 
arose the expression so commonly used the laws 
of nature we must see from this that it is purely 
figurative but though very convenient for general 
purposes it cannot be denied that it has a great 
tendency to mislead those who employ it and to 
make them think that every thing jumps here and 
jumps there in consequence of a sic volo or in 
junction given to them at creation by nature the 
agents that keep the universe in harmonious action 
being invisible such phrases help to take away all 
uncertainty and mankind repose upon them with a 
security that will last as long as their ignorance of 



of attraction 

the real nature of things exists for the mind of man 
has as great a horror of uncertainty as philoso 
phers tell us nature lias of a vacuum 



of attraction 

 the word attraction by its derivation means 
the act of drawing to but its employment as an 
agent can only tend to mislead and is not useful 
even theoretically it is one of those remarkable 
instances of the effect that language has in mislead 
ing the minds of even the acutest and most cautious 
of men but scientific and natural philosophers will 
find that they are beguiled by language as much as 
the rest of mankind and that they are then as much 
under the dominion of fancy as those who are not 
supposed to be like themselves lovers of calculation 
and matters of fact 

 no movement it will be admitted can be 
evident to us without it is perceived by some one 
of our senses matter is consequently necessary to 
the existence of those forms which we can per 
ceive for whatever form is of sufficient magnitude 
and solidity to be cognisable by our touch and is 
still not tangible we naturally and truly pronounce 
to be a mere vision and to have no outward exis 
tence but while we are thus sensible that matter 
is indispensably requisite to movement we must be 



j of scientific reasoning 

equally certain that that which is void of life and 
thought can in no way move itself if we say it is 
done by attraction we then assert that bodies mu 
tually attract one another and so join together spon 
taneously this may be a very easy though not a 
very profound way of accounting for the junction 
and approximation of bodies if a juggler says va 
presto and seems to make anything disappear by 
word of command he may deceive children and 
ignorant people but those who are better informed 
only admire the dexterity he had displayed in the 
feat that a philosopher should talk of attraction as 
a reality and attribute all the phenomena in nature 
to it is drawing as strongly on the credulity of 
mankind in general as the juggler does upon the 
simplicity of his company it is in vain that the 
philosopher says in his own defence that he means 
by such an expression only to assert a general fact 
namely the tendency of one body to another if he 
mean no more he should remember that he who 
would be the very first to cavil at any term that 
was contrary to the technical phraseology he is in the 
habit of employing should be the last to make use 
of an expression that contains in itself an assumption 
that he cannot defend but he will not make the 
admission till he is hard pressed and then he will 
instantly relapse into his real and habitual concep 
tion and talk of attractive and repulsive forces as in 
dubitable facts thus showing that he has no other 



of attraction 

opinion on the subject than the one he has been 
forced for the moment to abandon nor could it 
be othenvise if thought and words have any confor 
mity and be it likewise remembered that these 
same forces are the mere chimeras of his own ima 
gination see 

 it is easy to understand how one body 
may attract another for a boatman with his hook 
may be seen to attract or draw to himself another 
boat but how one atom or one body can of itself at 
tract another seems utterly incomprehensible to me 
i feel it is only battering down a wall of pasteboard 
to make these remarks for not only do natural 
philosophers feel that attraction is one of those 
points which they must surrender up the moment it 
is vigorously attacked and which they only pre 
serve for want of a better definition but the reader 
is aware that this famous agent is nothing more 
than an abstraction which has been converted into 
a reality by the mere course of language and there 
fore has no existence except as a sound it conse 
quently stands in the unhappy situation of the non 
causa pro causa of logicians 



of attractive and repulsive forces 

 natural philosophers having satisfied 
themselves of the existence of attraction have 

n 



 of scientific reasoning 

founded upon this belief the doctrine of attractive 
and repulsive forces as real powers we have seen 
that the notion of force is purely abstract and 
likewise general and that therefore it has no 
existence except by the medium of language we 
have further seen that if we are to understand any 
thing by the term we must refer it to something that 
forces and in every case it can only be effected 
through the medium of a real essence which i call 
by the name of power that may be 
made to exhibit its energy by the means of any 
body that it can move but mathematicians having 
taken the word force as a reality have constructed 
their arguments upon the strength of the supposi 
tion and it must be admitted that they labour under 
many chances of being deluded when they theorize 
without a due knowledge of the nature of language 
all that is statical and dynamical in nature being 
strictly in accordance with science it is not sur 
prising that they find but little difficulty in antici 
pating most of the obvious consequences resulting 
from this important truth but then it is attended 
by one great disadvantage namely that as in the 
case i have supposed about nothing they may 
assume any theory and prove it to themselves and 
others with the usual parade of the most rigorous 
demonstration thus according to the undulatory 
theory of light of huygens they have only to as 
sume the propulsion of waves agreeably to certain 



of attractive and repulsive forces 

laws and they may without difficulty satisfy them 
selves that it is right but if they laid aside their 
symbols and asked themselves how waves could 
cross each other in the same instant of time above 
below on every side and at all angles without 
disturbing confusing or obliterating their own ef 
fects they might be brought to feel that something 
more than nicety of observation and dexterity in 
wielding the calculus are necessary in such investi 
gations and the very same objection lies against 
the radial theory of newton some other hypothe 
sis therefore must be sought for to account for the 
propagation of light and even were either rays or 
waves free from the difficulties i have pointed out 
it would be still necessary to show what it is that 
propels either the one or the other with such asto 
nishing velocity a theory is not worth any thing 
that merely amuses us with words or assumes 
something that requires as much explanation as 
that which it was meant to expound the doctrine 
of forces can only be admitted in questions of pure 
mathematics where the whole of the topics under calcu 
lation are all equally abstract but when it is pre 
tended that the cohesion of bodies for instance can 
be explained by the means of attractive and repul 
sive forces it is clear that nothing but error and 
misconception can be the consequence for it is 
only to assume that the attractive force an abs 
traction is equal to a certain amount and that the 



 of scientific reasoning 

repulsive force an abstraction is something less 
which therefore allows the attractive force to be 
the stronger of the two and so all things in nature 
are very ingeniously firmly and compactly held 
together by this attractive abstraction when of 
course the whole finishes with q e d and every 
one is satisfied in making these remarks i have 
not the most remote intention of undervaluing the 
labours of mathematicians which in all that regards 
pure science have been of inestimable value to 
mankind and really constitute what may without 
exaggeration be called the glory of the human intel 
lect my only object is to point out that a know 
ledge of the nature of words is an important nay an 
indispensable branch of their calling and without 
which they will as often as they begin to theorize 
fall into the most absurd mistakes they should 
therefore be on their guard whenever they are 
considering a question of physical science and re 
member that their symbols either represent what is 



 it is worthy of remark that the germs of nearly every funda 
mental notion in science is be found among the hindus apparently 
unborrowcd but there seems to exist no trace of that branch of ma 
thematics called conic sections these immortal investigations of 
the properties of the sections of the cone to which modern astronomy 
is so much indebted for its most brilliant discoveries is therefore 
entirely due to greek genius and show what it could effect in abstract 
science when a rational subject was presented for its employment

of affinity 

real or something that is purely abstract and 
therefore unreal 



of affinity 

l the word affinity is here introduced 
rather with a view of drawing the reader s attention 
to the fact that it is not overlooked than for the pur 
pose of any particular elucidation by its etymology 
it means nearness but this sense is merely figura 
tive as to its scientific use where it marks the 
fitness of one substance to combine with another by 
known laws though employed much in the same 
way as the word attraction it does not assume so 
much as that contested term because being used in 
a neuter sense it lays no claim to being an agent 
in nature but is felt to be as it ought to be consi 
dered rather as a result when however kirwan 
and some succeeding writers on chemistry sub 
divide affinity into various kinds every one must feel 
that they have merely multiplied terms to an unne 
cessary extent and that they have only obscured 
a subject sufficiently mysterious we are told 
that there are the following kinds of affinity 

 n in note e of the appendix it will be seen that mr davies 
gilbert has cleared up the difficulties that involved in mystery the 
nature of negative and imaginary quantities but he does not seem 
to have been aware of the paralogisms attendant upon the ordinary 
use of abstractions in mathematical and other reasoning

 the reader will be quite convinced by 
the above specimen that it is unnecessary to pursue 
the subject any farther 



of the vis inertise c 

 newton considered that there is a passive 
principle by which bodies persist in their motion 
or rest in proportion to the force impressing it and 
resist as much as they are resisted to which he 
gave the name vis inertia or the power of resistance 
had this question not related to mechanics but to 
the abstract expression of the laws of the phenomena 
of nature we might have understood that he meant 
by this passive principle nothing more than that 
all bodies continue to move as long as they are im 
pelled and that action and reaction are equal and 
opposite if we do not take the expression in this 
last sense we must suppose that he used the terms 
 motion rest and force with a concrete 
meaning and then we shall be reduced to the 



of the vis inertia c 

further dilemma of inferring that his passive prin 
ciple is a real agent in nature now supposing 
for a moment that this was what he meant it is 
not very easy to comprehend how an agent by 
which bodies resist as much as they are resisted 
could be passive the fact is that the difficulty 
that arises in our minds on this occasion is that 
which must ever result from the use of abstract 
language with regard to fundamental notions by 
not remembering that notion rest force and simi 
lar words are purely abstract terms we cannot 
but argue in a circle and end in amusing ourselves 
at the best with phrases that when examined are 
found to be nothing to the purpose or to beg the whole 
question science is undoubtedly an abstract pro 
cess and for the mathematical solution of the laws of 
motion various things must be assumed by which 
mathematicians arrive at a true expression of the 
desired answer but in so doing they ought never 
to forget the nature of the words or the symbols 
they have employed in the process of reasoning 
and calculation and both operations will be found 
to have a nearer resemblance to one another than is 
generally supposed let us in opposition to in 
ertia inertness suppose that all movement is pro 
pagated solely by means of the real essence power 
we shall then have something that stands in the 
relation of cause to the effect and be certain that 
bodies cannot move without it that they are there 



 op scientific reasoning 

fore perfectly passive and indifferent merely chang 
ing place when impelled by it and continuing in 
movement resistance or place only as long as they 
are under its influence we shall also see that bodies 
must be always inert of their own nature and we 
consequently get rid of this extra agent that is both 
active and passive at the same moment and which 
has been introduced into the mechanism of nature 
under the delusive influence of language 

 by a notion similar to that which led 
newton to the employment of the term vis iiiertice 
mathematicians speak of the following kinds of 
force 

vis activa 
 passiva 
 absoluta 
 accelatrix 
 impressa 



 centripeta 
 matrix 



 since writing these remarks i find that sir john herschel has 
explained away the agency of the vis inertia and consequently its 
reality see his able discourse on natural philosophy the 
object of my remarks being to show the delusive influence of lan 
guage over the minds of the soundest reasoners it still remains a 
question in what sense newton himself understood the term i 
have already shown in that language led him into error with 
regard to attractive and repulsive forces 



of the vis inertle c 

 to the foregoing must be added the vis 
viva and the vis mortua of leibnitz such terms 
may be useful and can lead to no misconception 
as long as the true nature of language is not for 
gotten but it is hardly possible that they can be 
employed by mathematicians through the ten 
dency to realism that always exists in the mind 
of every man without being mistaken for real 
entities 



of the vis vitae sfc 

 the practisers of the healing art must 
have been among the earliest votaries if not the 
pioneers of science the pugnacious tendencies of 
mankind were continually calling into use whatever 
skill they had acquired and if we may judge from 
the accurate specimen afforded us of the prac 
tice of semisavage life in the pacific ocean 
human ingenuity arrives at considerable perfection 
in conditions of society that would scarcely promise 
such advancement the followers of the medical 
art must have been strongly impressed with the 
secret agency of nature in effecting those surprising 
cures and restoration of parts which came from 
time to time under their observation from the 
days of hippocrates to the present physicians have 

 see mariner s very interesting account of the friendly isles 



 of scientific reasoning 

employed various terms that express their convic 
tion of some secret force operating in animal bodies 
of these the following are the most common 

vis vita 

 mortua 

 medicatrix natures 

 conservatrix 

 plustica 

 nervosa 

 insita 

 other names have been assigned such 
as archcea by van helmont and impetum faciens 
by boerhaave perhaps to all these terms we must 
attribute an abstract rather than a concrete sense 
and they are no other than so many attempts to 
hide ignorance of causes under fictitious names 
which might serve as props to support the under 
standing from betraying its weakness to itself and 
to others 

 having said so much against the abuses 
attendant upon the employment of abstract lan 
guage without we preserve a perpetual conscious 
ness of its real nature i think the present is a 
favourable opportunity for pointing out its indispen 
sable utility as the sole means of classification and 
reasoning all diseases being merely states of the 
body it follows that without the help of abstrac 



of the vis vitve c 

tions they could never have been the object of 
reflection for as they have no other existence than 
as sounds they would be without a designation and 
consequently never being the subject of thought 
we should be only able to say that one person was 
sick or affected just like such another person or that 
he was feverish gouty coughed c now however 
we can say that he has a fever tertian quartan 
or any other that he has the gout a cough c 
the obvious inference to be derived from this ob 
servation is that though diseases are classed under 
separate heads they must really be as different from 
one another even when called by the same name 
as the bodies are in which they occur 



 



of the mind 

 the investigation of what is called the 
mind will be sufficient of itself to show that the 
consideration of the nature of words is no con 
temptible pursuit but one really deserving of the 
closest application of our faculties the mind 
is one of those comprehensive and abstract gene 
ralities which we are momentarily in the habit of 
employing till at last we believe them to be per 
fectly real things of which it would be folly to 
doubt a little reflection will however convince us 
that at least in the manner in which we make use 
of these expressions we are under a great miscon 
ception to feel the full force of this remark we 
must consider what are the constituent parts of 
the mind and what likewise is their nature if 
we accurately analyse them we must see that they 
consist reason being excepted merely in what are 
called the faculties which consequently are mere 
abstractions and to them therefore i now proceed 
to draw the reader s attention after a few remarks 
upon sensation consciousness and intelligence 



of sensation consciousness and intelligence 

 no right consideration of the mind can be 
undertaken without a due comprehension of these 
three terms 

 a zoophyte and most animals just born 
cannot be said to possess consciousness and it is 
not for some days after the birth of an infant that 
it shows symptoms of this state and a very much 
longer period elapses before it exhibits signs of 
intelligence so when any one is asleep w r e dis 
cover that even sensation is almost dormant and 
that when suddenly roused he is simply conscious 
but it is not until he is broad awake that he can 
give an intelligible answer though he is perfectly 
conscious of the presence of the person who may be 
interrogating him all these facts point out that 
sensation consciousness and intelligence are to 
tally distinct states and that the abode of each 
must be sought for in separate organs physiology 
has decisively shown that it is to the nerves we 
must look as the seat of sensation and that the 
information they obtain is referred at once to the 
brain which is the common centre from which they 
radiate mediately or immediately it is the brain 
therefore or a part of its contents that is con 
scious of what the nerves have experienced and if 
the impressions are not of a transitory nature the 



 of the mind 

consciousness of such sensations is then termed 
memory our feelings therefore are recorded in 
the brain as in a memorandumbook but we might 
as well expect that such a volume could make use 
of its contents as that the brain should be able to 
employ its own materials that is that what is con 
scious should supply the place of that which is 
intelligent if sensation depend on the nervous 
system and consciousness on some portion of the 
brain we must equally believe that the intelligence 
which with the aid of reason is to compare clas 
sify and decide upon the facts at its disposal must 
have its own peculiar organ what portion of the 
contents of the scull is thus preeminently distin 
guished over the whole system it is not my inten 
tion to discuss at present but it is evident that 
it must be as superior to the portion of the brain 
that is conscious as this is to the nerves and as 
these again are to the muscles and coarser parts 
of the body it is this unknown organ so highly 
endowed and constituting the thinking reflecting 
agent resulting from the combination of soul with 
matter duly organized that i call in these pages 
by the name of intellect but as the brain is the 
general term for the contents of the scull what i 
have just said must be so far modified as not to 
mislead any one and that portion of its contents 
which is conscious ought for the sake of clearness 
of conception to be called by some word which 



sensation consciousness and intelligence 

would clearly express its office and for this reason 
i assign it the name of sensorium 

 it must not however be supposed for a 
moment that though the intellect sensorium and 
nerves are separate and distinct organs that they 
are independent of one another they are to be 
considered as forming a triad in which every one is 
essential to the operation of the other nor can 
intelligence on any occasion dispense with feeling 
when it pronounces judgment on the facts pre 
sented to it by consciousness except on an abstract 
subject for instance when we say that the whole 
is equal to all its parts feeling is in abeyance 
though the notion of whole and parts was originally 
obtained through its means the intellect without 
the aid of the materials afforded by the sensorium 
and derived from the nerves would be as useless 
as a mill that is without grain and a hopper it is 
the union therefore of intellect sensorium and 
nerves that constitute the mysterious agent called 
self and which is consequently intelligent conscious 
and feeling and when under the guidance of reason 
is also rational this triple being resembles exter 
nally a bulbous root with its dependent fibres the 
other parts of the body being subsidiary adjuncts 
intended for effecting nutrition and action under 
the will of the intellect the calls of the appetites 
and likewise but too often under the unbridled 



 op the mind 

dictates of the passions are the feelings then 
too acute the appetites too craving and the pas 
sions too violent the intellect will be troubled in its 
operations and the still small voice of reason 
being unheard the individual is for the time under 
what is termed mental derangement even though he 
is not what is actually called mad but though our 
feelings do occasionally betray us into excesses that 
are injurious in their consequences to ourselves and 
others we must never forget that no decision can 
take place with the exception just alluded to that is 
not effected under their influence a fact of the ut 
most consequence in the regulation of our conduct 

of the faculties 

 of all the faculties of the mind there 
being none so important as the understanding i 
commence with it the first great delusion we are 
under is in supposing that the word understanding 
represents any thing whatsoever we that is our 
thinking selves may understand what we hear or 
see but when we employ the abstract word under 
standing for some part of ourselves we do so 
clearly by a fallacy when we understand anything 
we necessarily feel are conscious and intelligent and 
were i to analyse the term understanding according 
to the usual mode in these cases i would conse 
quently say that it is compounded of feeling 



of the faculties 

consciousness and intelligence for if i analyse 
one abstraction i shall most likely do it by the help 
of others but in reality there is neither under 
standing feeling consciousness nor intelligence 
and instead of these we must remember that it 
is the union of soul with matter which being 
organized into human frames understands feels is 
conscious and intelligent this i think is suffi 
ciently obvious and i now proceed to say the same 
of some other of the most remarkable of our fa 
culties 

 we talk of the faculties we call memory 
imagination judgment will attention reflection 
c but it is obvious we must do the same with 
these abstractions as with the understanding and 
remember that all we can truly say is that we our 
individual selves can remember imagine judge will 
attend reflect c and nothing more consequently 
the supposition of faculties upon which we so often 
draw is a mere conventional form of speech and 
however expedient or inevitable this course is we 
ought never to forget its real nature when we in 
vestigate such matters otherwise we shall only 
delude ourselves and mislead others we call 
these abstractions faculties and powers but it 
is only by a sort of figure of speech and yet men go 
on gravely discussing the nature of these faculties 
as realities of which there can be no doubt we 



of the mind 



likewise forget that the words faculty and power 
are both abstract terms 

 the faculties if we except reason con 
stituting the whole of what is called the mind we 
must see that the very thing of which we were as 
sure as of our own bodies resolves itself into the 
mere operations of what we may appropriately 
call the intellectual agent which in the sense that 
results from the preceding views means nothing 
more than the thinking individual cognisant of 
exterior nature through the organs of sense it is 
in short as i have before said the mysterious being 
that results from the equally mysterious combina 
tion of soul with matter language though the 
essential and indispensable instrument of thought 
ought never to be mistaken for that which thinks 
that is to say for the intellect yet language is as 
indispensable to it as wheels are to a carriage and 
were a shakspeare to be utterly deprived of the 
memory of words he would not merely be unable to 
think but be simply a cunning animal from which 
we must feel that speech was as much designed 
as an aid to the intellect as the hands and legs 
are to the body or as the trunk is to the elephant 
and indeed is actually so identified with the intel 
lect as to be mistaken for what we call i the mind 



of reason 

 of all the divisions into which we separate 
the mind reason is the only one which is not a 
misconception arising from the delusive nature of 
language it is not a faculty but a real aycnt 
aiding and assisting the intellect of man in all its 
varied operations upon what grounds i make 
this assertion must be deferred for the present as 
it would not merely involve me in a disquisition of 
a length disproportioned to the other questions 
which i have selected for discussion but because it 
will appear more appropriately hereafter in con 
nexion with that to which it has never been 
suspected to be related and all i have to say will 
consequently then be better understood than it 
could be in this place in so doing i do not ask the 
reader for any admission but merely that he will 
suspend his judgment till i can produce all the evi 
dence necessary to leave no doubt of the truth on his 
mind and he will then see why instinct never errs 
while reason of which we are so proud is ever in 
danger of going astray 

of insanity 

 the preceding views demonstrate that 
what we call the mind is merely a collective 
term for the operations of the intellect when we 



 of the mind 

speak therefore of insanity of mind we can only do 
so by a figure of speech and we must consequently 
look for the cause of mental alienation in the absence 
of our knowledge of the abode of the intellect to 
the state of the brain and nervous system the 
question of moral insanity that is of disease of that 
separate part of us which is commonly called the 
mind has long been agitated among medical rea 
soners but had just notions of language been en 
tertained the subject could never have been mooted 
if therefore no other advantage could be derived 
from the preceding remarks than the placing this 
important point in its true light the effort would 
certainly have been worth the trouble insanity 
it is evident must always be a physical disease 
for it would be an absurdity to suppose that the soul 
could be subject to derangement disease or death 

of ideas 

 perhaps it will be impossible to find in 
the whole range of our language any word that has 
been brought into such general use as idea and 
which if we examine it closely is so little entitled 
to the distinction so much indeed has this word 
obtained a general currency that it requires some 
hardihood to call its legitimacy in question what 
we term an idea being derived from a greek 

 fc o 



of ideas 

word implying i see signifies properly a sight but 
is restricted by convention to mean a form or 
image not perceived by the senses but supposed to 
be conceived by the mind it is generally assumed 
that ideas are as it were the pabulum of our 
thoughts but if we closely examine this point 
we shall find it to be an error and that though 
the belief in ideas has prevailed over that of species 
ever since the time of des cartes we have only sub 
stituted one illegitimate notion for another when 
we reason we do but employ words and if we 
seem to call up the images or perceptions of the 
things they represent it is merely by that insepa 
rable conjunction that exists between the objects 
of our thoughts and to which the term association 
of ideas is applied the same result how 
ever will take place if we hear any word pro 
nounced in a particular way to which our attention 
had been once strongly drawn for on hearing it 
again we shall in all probability call up the image 
of the person and even the place where we first 
heard it such things must have been observed by 
every one how often does it happen that we can 
not bring to mind not the idea but the exact word 
we feel is required by the nature of what we have 
said and of what we are about to say our dis 
course in these respects being like a piece of 



 of the mind 

mosaic or a dissected map we know we want 
something and we are quite aware what form it 
should have to fill up the gap in what we are con 
structing yet there can be no idea image or form 
previously in our minds if what we require should 
be an abstract term but does it refer to some 
thing we have seen touched c then we call up the 
image in our endeavour to find the word we want 
if any one will closely attend to the operations of 
his own mind he will find this to be the fact when 
we argue about something that we have never seen 
ourselves or had pourtrayed to us by a pictorial 
or other representation we can talk about it just as 
clearly and as cogently as if we spoke from personal 
knowledge yet in so doing we do not call up or 
form any image on the subject if for instance i 
talk of mango capac the divine founder of the 
peruvian monarchy i have not merely no image of 
him in my mind but as i never remember to have 
seen any representation of him produced by the 
imagination of another i do so without any other 
aid than that of words again if i tell the reader 
that the chinese employ to a great extent a hard 
substance of a granular formation in their cookery 
and that it is of so much consequence to this singu 
lar people that it is to be seen piled up in large 
stacks on the banks of their canals and rivers ready 

 see note f 



of ideas 

for transportation throughout the country and that 
the want of it would cause an immediate commotion 
in man woman and child from one end of the 
empire to the other i am sure he is able to com 
prehend all i have said though his imagination 
has not perhaps in this description called up the 
idea of the thing i mean as a further proof that 
it is only with words we reason let the reader 
remember that eight out of the nine parts of speech 
which we employ in reasoning cannot by any pos 
sible means be referred to ideas if children and 
people of vivid imaginations do at times couple 
the images of things with the tenour of the dis 
courses not the single words that they hear this is 
no proof that each word represents an idea very 
often it arises merely as i before said from the 
association of ideas but generally from a more than 
usual interest in what they are listening to and it 
is natural on such an occasion that they should 
substitute some person place or other object which 
had previously come under their cognisance for 
what they hear described but this cannot be the 
case in discourses that relate to moral and abstract 
subjects for what picture or image can we call up 
to identify with such words as principle and con 
duct or profundity research glory c to reason 

 r those whose imagination may not have helped them to the 
solution of what is here intended will find it in note g of the 
appendix 



 of the mind 

therefore is to employ language according to 
the frame of our intellect just as to walk is to 
employ our legs according to the action for which 
they were formed there can consequently be no 
reasoning without language as there can be no 
walking without legs nor flying without wings the 
applying therefore the term idea to any single 
word is a mere mental delusion founded upon 
custom and derived from the misconception of 
metaphysicians 

 having thus shown that we cannot call a 
word that stands for a perception that is for some 
thing concrete an idea it may be questioned how 
far it is merely useful as the representative of the 
remaining class of words called conceptions by 
the very nature of the word idea it implies some 
thing that is single it cannot therefore represent 
those inferences phrases opinions c already al 
luded to and which are really or virtually 
compounded of many single words yet we conti 
nually employ it for such purposes so we also say 
such is my idea c though we mean on such 
occasions l my opinion my notion my sentiments c 
we must see therefore that idea is one of those 
words that are introduced into language from time 
to time without the least necessity for so doing 
and that by its rejection we should be really bene 
fitted for whatever tends to make language vague 



of ideas 

not merely unfits it for its legitimate use but is 
really injurious to every process of reasoning as a 
word that seemed so happily to stand as a general 
representative for concrete and abstract terms its 
use might have been tolerated in philosophical in 
vestigations but as we have seen that it is inadmis 
sible as the representative of perceptions it may be 
justly doubted whether it would not be better if it 
vere altogether discarded from philosophical lan 
guage as merely tending to multiply without any 
adequate advantage the terms which are used in 
reasoning in these pages it has been only em 
ployed for the purpose of refutation or of quotation 
as not merely useless but tending to create false 
inferences for besides being a redundancy it has 
not like perception and conception the advantage 
of being connected with a verb in our language 
few reasoners can be more clear than locke as far 
as regards the making his sentiments understood 
and yet by calling the words we employ to repre 
sent what we have conceived by our minds as well 
as what we have perceived with our senses by the 
term ideas he has diminished much of the perspi 
cuity that he might have introduced into his work 
all true knowledge consists in individualization and 
exact representation and many false and incorrect 
notions pass without detection by the use of general 
and therefore vague words we ought to avoid 
the needless multiplication of terms to which our 



 of the mind 



language is but too prone owing to the various 
sources from which it is derived multiplication of 
terms being apt to generate the notion of multipli 
city of things a baneful tendency in philosophy 
the word conception however has not only a 
beauty and force from being connected with the 
verb to conceive but is moreover of particular 
value as being applicable to all the conceptions of 
our minds as well as to our combinations of words 
into phrases thus we can apply it to the inven 
tions of the poet the artist the musical composer 
and to those of the mechanic properties that render 
it a term of peculiar aptitude and felicity for every 
thing connected with what can be conceived by the 
intellect but if we contrast the word idea with 
perception and conception we must at once disco 
ver that it is not the true representative of either 
the one or the other for if it be employed for the 
first we must see that image is a more correct term 
and if for the last that is to say for conception we 
must be equally convinced that a word that in its 
own language meant an image or form cannot 
without a certainty of error be applied to mere 
sounds that have no more existence than so much 
breath and that its employment in a double cha 
racter can only produce confusion of thought and 
consequently fallacy of judgment for i must once 
more remind the reader that an idea must either 
be the equivalent of a perception or a conception 



of ideas 

and that these two words are merely abstractions 
that could have no sense if we did not refer them 
respectively to the only assertion any of us can 
truly make namely i perceive things and i con 
ceive states 



of abstract ideas 

 i have said so much on the real nature of 
abstract ideas in that i feel it is only necessary 
to allude to them here to show that they have not 
been forgotten in the systematic view which i have 
proposed to myself in the present remarks if 
ideas really represent nothing and are merely 
names for the sounds or symbols w r e call concep 
tions it is obvious that the abstracting of these 
abstractions is a mere delusion of language for 
abstract ideas therefore ye ought invariably to 
substitute the expressions abstract terms abstract 
words or abstractions 

of the association of ideas 

 from the preceding observations it is 
evident that we cannot with any propriety speak 
of the association of ideas but we may with 
greater justice do so of our associated recollections 
no one event or object being capable of being 
observed alone but always in conjunction with 



 of the mind 

others it naturally follows that we cannot think of 
any one of them without its being accompanied by 
those which were associated with it from the con 
nexion of time and place or of reflection for 
instance i rise from my chair and look out of the 
window on a beautiful meadow bespangled with 
countless wild flowers the sky is serenely beautiful 
not a cloud is to be seen the air conveys along 
with a delightful coolness the most agreeable 
fragrance from the rich vegetation over which it 
has passed beneath the umbrageous foliage of a 
horsechesnut i behold some cows that have sought 
shelter in a shallow pool at its roots from the 
ardent heat of the sun they are engaged in chew 
ing the cud and whisking their tails to keep off the 
tormenting attacks of innumerable wingedinsects 
that are hovering around them i see the milk 
maid approaching with a pail in one hand and a 
stool and tether in the other during all this 
scene my ears are delighted with the songs of 
various birds that express the fulness of their joy of 
existence in a thousand varied notes my palate is 
gratified at this moment by the flavour of the fruit 
i am eating my fingers too touch the soft and 
dimpled cheek of a child beautiful as a cherub and 
these objects occupy all my senses at once and give 
rise to the most pleasing reflections my bosom 
too is in harmony by its own sensations with the 
picture i have sketched so imperfectly and all my 



of the association of ideas 

thoughts and emotions carry me at once to the 
contemplation of the wondrous being by whom the 
whole has been created and continues to be upheld 
and that by an agency at once mysterious and 
omnipotent now as nothing in nature can be seen 
felt or thought of singly it matters not which of 
these objects reflections or feelings may be called 
up at any time hereafter it will as far as memory 
serves be accompanied or associated with the 
others with which it is conjoined this simple fact 
however would if it passed through the alembic of 
a metaphysician s brains be mystified under the 
wonderworking term association of ideas by 
the means of which it has been attempted to 
account for instinct itself with which it has no 
more to do than with respiration function or any 
other operation of the animal economy so great 
an influence have mere phrases that they are 
endowed by mankind with agency to perform every 
office in nature nay we find metaphysicians even 
going farther in error than the rest of mankind 
under every point of view therefore the expres 
sion i associated recollections is not merely more 
exact but more intelligible than that of the asso 
ciation of ideas when we speak of associations 
that are present and not past we may call them 
associated impressions 



 



of various metaphysical categories 

 from the earliest dawn of thought up to 
the present moment mankind have been the dupes 
of language impelled by an irresistible curiosity 
they have endeavoured to compel nature to give up 
her secret and though the wisdom of egypt had 
pronounced with oracular truth that her veil had 
not been drawn aside by any man and thereby 
implied that it never could be done and though a 
poet of persia endowed with more than usual in 
spiration had declared that men might desist from 
the attempt for that her enigma never had been 
and never could be solved yet still it is and ever 
will be the object of human investigation and per 
severance if we look to those ancient authorities 
with which we are most familiar that is to say to 
the greeks we shall find that this most ingenious 
people profiting by the hints they had received 
from the phoenicians egyptians and other eastern 
nations who were most renowned in their day for 
wisdom and civilization pursued with an ardour 
worthy of a more fortunate result and a persever 
ance that nothing but the insuperable difficulty of 
the subject could have baffled the investigation of 
the great mystery of life they were not aware

that independently of the perplexity and incompre 
hensibleness of the question they were deceived at 
every step by the very nature of the instrument 
with which they hoped to obtain a right solution 
of the mysterious problem this instrument was 
language it will be only necessary to look cur 
sorily at their fundamental distinctions to be con 
vinced how greatly they were deceived but if 
such men as plato and aristotle were thus misled 
how could it be otherwise with inferior minds if 
we contrast the systems of these eminent men with 
those of other schools cotemporary and modern 
we shall find that the views of all are based upon 
the same radical errors 



 of various metaphysical categories 

platos 

 plato the pupil of socrates who was him 
self the soundest and most modest thinker that greece 
or perhaps any country has ever produced flourished 
at a time when these studies had been brought to a 
considerable perfection of system and when the 
intelligence of the greeks was at its height his 
celebrated dialogues though abounding in sur 
prising beauties and infinite subtleties are so 
blended with mysticism and the mysteries of the 
religion of his country that it requires all the 
veneration and admiration that the moderns have 
for the remains of greek genius not to smile and to 
feel surprise that one of the ablest men one indeed 
of the greatest geniuses of his own or any other 
age could have been so deluded by mere fancies 
let us take for example his five forms which he 
considered the basis of existence they might be 
explained thus 

substance 

similitude 

diversity 

permanence 

movement 

 though commentators give a different 
interpretation to these five forms of plato i believe 
that the meanings i have assigned them are very 



plato s aristotle s 



nearly those he himself intended they should have 
because a reference to the categories of aristotle 
which were doubtlessly framed in opposition to 
them will evidently form the best commentary on 
those of his master but that the reader may be 
able to judge for himself i subjoin the original 
terms and the translation of the words of the 
commentators such as they have been handed 
down from antiquity whichever representation 
the reader may prefer he cannot but be convinced 
that they are only reveries by which their inventor 
allowed himself to be deluded through a few sounds 
plato undoubtedly considered that these words re 
presented real entities or things in nature by the 
name he assigned them and similar beliefs we 
have seen exist to this day without the excuse that 
might be alleged for him 

aristotle s 

 the foregoing view of plato s forms will 
as i have just said be strengthened by the ten cate 
gories of aristotle his pupil and opponent they 
are commonly translated as follows 

 r otxna the principle essence ravrov the same regarding the 
relation it bears to itself and other things erepov the other when one 
varies from another oraltm while it keeps its station or preserves a 
unity kvvijo motion or that by which it exerts a power to act

 when we remember that the systems of 
these two eminent men are completely in contrast 
and that though the first took the ideal and the 
second the real view of nature we must see that 
both were deceived by language for their terms 

 ovtrta ttooov trotoi vpocrri ttov vore keiarai eeiv troteiv irdayeiv 
 aristotle held against plato that previous to and indepen 
dent on matter there were no universal ideas or essences and that 
the ideas or exemplars which the latter supposed to have existed in 
the divine mind and to have been the models of all created things 
had been eternally impressed upon matter and were coeval with and 
inherent in their objects zeno and his followers departing both 
from the platonic and aristotelian systems maintained that these pre 
tended universals had neither form nor essence and were no more 
than mere terms and nominal representations of their particular ob 
jects the doctrine of aristotle prevailed until the eleventh century 
when roscellinus embraced the stoical system and founded the sect 
of the nominalists whose sentiments were propagated by the famous 
abelard these two sects realists and nominalists differed considera 
bly among themselves and explained or rather obscured their respec 
tive tenets in a variety of ways note to dr maclaine s translation 
of mosheim s ecclesiastical history it was not zeno but his master 
stilpo the megarean who first maintained the position that universals 
and species had no other existence than as words it is to him and to 
roscellinus in modern times see that we must assign the doc 
trines held by the nominalists neither the one nor other however 
appear to have doubted the reality of qualities upon this point all 
philosophers seem merely to have differed as to whether they existed 
in the object or in the mind see my remarks in 



aristotles 



though all used in different senses by both were 
mere abstractions and therefore possess no claim 
to be considered as a correct analysis of nature 
plato s forms were undoubtedly understood and 
conceived by him to be something as actual as his 
own existence and though it might be argued that 
aristotle intended his only as a classification yet 
let any candid person examine his metaphysical 
system and he will be convinced that aristotle took 
all these words as expressing real entities just as 
has been done subsequently by his followers the 
realists among the schoolmen aristotle believing 
them to exist eternally in matter as species plato 
in the divine mind as universals 

 it will not be uninteresting to compare 
the foregoing divisions of the academic and peri 
patetic schools with those of india there is such 
a general affinity between them that they could not 
have had an independent production but must 
have stood more or less in the relation of parent 
and offspring whether the originality be conceded 
to greece or to india it may however be re 
marked that the hindu systems are all complete 
and peculiar in themselves and every part is in 
harmony with the whole of any one system which 
likewise contains principles totally unnoticed by the 
greeks for the originality of the hindu systems 
it may be further remarked that they have all a 



 of various metaphysical categories 

special application being intended either to support 
or controvert the texts of the vedas or hindu scrip 
tures which are so ancient that the peculiar dialect 
of the language in which they were written the 
sanscrit was obsolete prior to the expedition of alex 
ander about years before the christian era to 
these observations it may be added that had their 
logic been borrowed from aristotle who was the pre 
ceptor of that conqueror it might be naturally 
expected to be as perfect as the copies made by the 
arabians and the moderns but instead of this being 
the case it bears all the appearance of a system 
which though in its infancy was a wonderful step 
in advance upon human knowledge but deficient in 
the refinements and subdivisions of the stagirite 
it bears in short pretty nearly the same relation to 
the system of aristotle that their algebra confess 
edly of hindu invention does to the state of that 
science in the present day 



 the reader who may take an interest in the subject can refer 
to mr colebrooke s exposition of hindu logic in the transactions 
of the royal asiatic society vol i pp or to his miscellaneous 
essays vol p in the asiatic journal for february 
colonel vans kennedy has given an exposition of hindu logic in which 
he differs apparently with reason from mr colebrooke and i think the 
following passage deserving of quotation but it seems at the same 
time evident that the argument of gautama and the syllogism of 
aristotle are too essentially different in both form and substance to 
admit of its being supposed that the one was derived from the other 
for the validity of the syllogism depends upon this axiom that if two 

terms 



 



gotamas 

 gotama is the reputed founder of logic in 
india the division of the predicaments or 
 objects of proof are six according to kanada 
viz 

substance community 

quality particularity 

action relation intimate 

to this arrangement other authors add a seventh 
privation or negation besides these categories 
others are alleged by different authorities 



terms agree with one and the same third they agree with each other but 
the nature and properties of the term which should be employed as 
the middle terms have not been explained by aristotle gautama 
on the contrary founds the conclusiveness of his argument on such a 
property being assigned as a reason for affirming the proposition as 
will prove the predicate and on the applicability of the reason being 
shown by adducing in its support the instance of some object which 
possesses the property specified in the reason and predicate in this 
case therefore it is not sufficient to lay it down as a rule that if a 
can be attributed to every b and b to every c then a is attributable 
to every c and to frame syllogisms with the letters of the alphabet 
for the argument of gautama cannot be formed unless a distinct notion 
of the properties of the subjects by which the question is to be proved 
has been first conceived when however this argument is duly con 
sidered it will perhaps be admitted that it exhibits a more natural 
mode of reasoning than is compatible with the compressed limits of 
the syllogism and that its conclusion is as convincing as that of the 
syllogism p 

 or aggregation 



 of various metaphysical categories 

 mind in common with all substance for 
they hold it to be such is the substratum of eight 
qualities viz 

number disjunction 

quantity priority 

individuality subsequence 

conjunction faculty 

 this last arrangement which is made by 
kanada is nothing more nor less than another set of 
predicaments or categories though termed qualities 
by him but as the predicaments in common with 
all qualities are considered as real essences by the 
hindus as well as by ourselves their distinction of 
the classes into categories and qualities makes no 
difference in their natures 

jina s 

 the jainas followers of jina who are an 
ancient and a celebrated sect in india have so many 
opinions in common with the bauddhas followers 
of buddha as to have been often confounded with 
them hold that there are five kdrana or causes 
which unite in the production of all events these 
are as follow 

 time 

 nature 

 fate or necessity 

 works or the principle of retributive justice 

 mental effort or perseverance 



iain as i 

 the jainas besides the above comprehend 
nature under the six following categories viz 

 motion time 

 rest life 

 vacuum matter 

with the exception of matter which is a generali 
zation of body and is therefore a concrete term 
the whole of the above are abstractions though the 
first group is considered as causes and the last as 
principles or categories but in both cases they 
were perfect realities in the conception of their 
framers and followers 

 the systems of gotama and jina will be 
sufficient to serve as an illustration of the identity of 
the fallacy into which the hindu philosophers have 
fallen in common with those of other countries 



 the next system to contrast with those 
that have been just given is that of the divisions of 
the soul which the parsees or descendants of the 
ancient persians attribute to zoroaster if not 



 bl i have preferred the above exposition given by colonel miles 
as more popular to that of mr colcbrooke printed in vol ix p 
of the asiatic researches of calcutta and reprinted in his essays 
vol ii p see transactions of the royal asiatic society p 



 of various metaphysical categories 

handed down from antiquity it was in all pro 
bability framed in india or borrowed from that 
fertile hotbed of metaphysical systems 

 the soul of man instead of a simple 
essence a spark of that eternal light which animates 
all things consists according to zoroaster of five 
separate parts each having peculiar offices 

 the feroher or principle of sensation 

 the boe or principle of intelligence 

 the rouan the principle of practical judgment ima 
gination volition 

 the akho or principle of conscience 

 the jan or principle of animal life 

when the four of these which cannot subsist in the 
body without the last abandon their earthly abode 
the jan mingles with the winds and the akho 
returns to heaven with the celestial rouhs or spi 
rits because its office being continually to do 
good and shun evil it can have no part in the 
guilt of the soul whatever that may be the boe 
the rouan and the feroher united together are 
the only principles which are accountable for the 
deeds of the man and which are accordingly to be 
examined at the day of judgment if good pre 
dominate they go to heaven if evil they are 
despatched to hell the body is regarded as a mere 
instrument in the power of the rouan and therefore 



zoroaster s 

not responsible for its acts after death the akho 
has a separate existence as the feroher had previous 
to its birth 

 it is not possible to pronounce on the 
terms contained in the division of the soul as attri 
buted to zoroaster without a thorough knowledge 
of the language in which the works considered as 
the production of that sage are written in all 
probability even if we admit of the authenticity of 
these five terms we shall not be far mistaken if we 
suppose that the most of them are but abstrac 
tions used in a real or personified sense that 
this is the case with the last of the five that is with 
jan is certain as it still means life or vitality 
in the modern language of persia but whether 
ancient or modern this dissection of the soul is of 
the highest interest as an additional instance of the 
delusions of the human mind and though not 
strictly in place here among the categories it is 
well worthy of attention 

locke s 

 it is to our own country that we must 
look for the next set of categories of nature and 

 h not having the zendavesta of anquctil ltlu perron at hand 
have borrowed the above extract from my friend mr james baillie 
frazer s judicious account of persia forming one of the volumes of 
the edinburgh cabinet library 



 of various metaphysical categories 

locke has distinctly furnished us with a system in 
which he has shortly and explicitly unfolded his 
views as he was a realist in every sense of the 
word we cannot hope to find that he does more 
than substitute his own set of general terms for 
those of others on reading them down the reader 
will see that they tell us nothing new and that 
they are arranged upon the notion that abstract 
words are real entities they do not even display 
any remarkable ingenuity or depth of thought and 
may even be contested as to the general views they 
inculcate he says 

 and thus i have in a short draught given 
a view of our original ideas from whence all the 
rest are derived and of which they are made up 
which if i would consider as a philosopher and 
examine on what causes they depend and of what 
they are made i believe they all might be reduced 
to these very few primary and original ones viz 

extension 

solidity 

mobility or the power of being moved 
which by our senses we receive from body 

perceptivity or the power of perception 
or thinking 

motivity or the power of moving which 
by reflection we receive from our minds 



locke s kant s 

 crave leave to make use of these two new words 
to avoid the danger of being mistaken in the use of 
those which are equivocal to which if we add 

existence 

duration 

number 

which belong both to the one and the other we 
have perhaps all the original ideas on which the 
rest depend for by these i imagine might be 
explained the nature of colours sounds tastes 
smells and all other ideas we have if we had but 
faculties acute enough to perceive the severally 
modified extensions and motions of those minute 
bodies which produce those several sensations in 
us 

kant s 

 as the last but one though not the least 
renowned and certainly the most perplexing of 
those who have added to these systems i proceed 
to consider the view of the human mind and of 
nature given by immanuel kant this extra 
ordinary man was so misled by his own subtlety 
and ingenuity that he conceived the notion of 
relieving metaphysics from the charge of uncertainty 
so justly urged against them he was aware that 
that in which no fixed principles were universally 
acknowledged could rest upon no solid foundation 

c conduct of human understanding book ii chap xxi 



 of various metaphysical categories 

among all preceding writers on the subject he 
thought that hume had at all events made one 
capital discovery in his essay on a necessary con 
nexion and that if there existed one 
notion necessity not drawn from experience which 
locke had convinced most thinking people was the 
only source of knowledge there might be more 
following up this notion he thought he had dis 
covered eleven others and upon these which i 
shall enumerate presently he built his dark and 
incomprehensible system but this was not all for 
it struck him that as one of the main difficulties 
that beset astronomers was removed by adopting 
the system of copernicus in place of that of 
ptolomy or in other words in preferring the belief 
that our planet revolved about the sun and not 
that the sun and other heavenly bodies revolved 
about us he conceived that by making time and 
space to exist in and not out of the mind he took 
away the great stumblingblock in metaphysics 
thus making all nature a subjective and not an 
objective existence yet strange to say he at the 
very same time made the following statement 
 our exposition consequently teaches the reality 
that is the objective validity of space in reference 
to all that externally as object can be presented 
to us but at the same time the ideality of space in 
reference to things if they are considered in them 
selves by means of reason that is without regard 



kant s 

to the nature of our sensibility here he evi 
dently contradicts himself and he well knew 
why for if all nature exist only in the mind what 
becomes of all other beings he therefore slipped 
in this non sequitur though it was contrary to the 
fundamental position he had laid down that it 
might serve as a loophole at which to escape if 
hard pressed upon the point 

 by these bold assumptions joined to his 
twelve celebrated categories he obtained what he 
considered would enable him to construct a system 
that might rest like mathematics on data that would 
be universally admitted and consequently be no 
longer dependent on proofs got from groping in the 
dark that is from uncertain experience or as he 
calls it empirical knowledge by the means of such 
foundations and assumptions he has built up with 
a style and terms of extreme obscurity a system so 
intricate and complicated that it has puzzled his 
warmest admirers and followers to make out what 
he would be at from time to time to this system 
he gave the name of transcendental because it 
transcended all proofs drawn from experience and 
made metaphysics an abstract science or one in 
which every problem could be solved by principles 
existing in the mind itself it was also his opinion

that only by means of this critic can the roots 
themselves be cut off from materialism fatalism 
atheism freethinking unbelief fanaticism and su 
perstition which may be universally hurtful finally 
also from idealism and scepticism which are more 
dangerous to the schools but hardly can pass over 
to the public the attempt was worthy of his 
genius but though he constructed his breakwater 
with the utmost skill yet it is evident that it could 
not built as it was upon so weak a foundation 
withstand the mighty though scarcely audible bil 
lows that rolled continually against it from the 
great ocean of common sense and which in fifty 
years have made so many ravages in its best com 
pacted parts that it lies a stupendous wreck over 
which the tide of opinion rises and falls without 
causing further devastation leaving it as a memo 
rial for future generations who will exclaim on 
beholding it thtre were giants in the earth in 
those dayst 

 it is now only necessary to analyse his 
system which is likewise founded upon another 
assumption namely that the human mind is com 
pounded of three estates or separate divisions that 
is to say of sense understanding and reason 
but i shall begin with the consideration of sense 
and merely draw the reader s attention to the fol 
lowing synoptical view of kant s system

sense 

 with regard to sense it is evidently an 
abstraction that can therefore have no real and 
separate existence we can feel and when we abs 
tract we can talk of feeling or its synonymous abs 
traction sense so much for the basis let us 
now consider its dependent notions this non 
entity sense has two other nonentities which he 
calls receptivities holdingnesses these two re 
ceptive nonentities have been vulgarly called space 
and time i have already shown that though 
classed together they ought to be kept 
separate because the first has a real and the second 
only a relative existence that is it is a notion or 
word we have derived from the apparent revolution 
of the sun round the earth both space and time 
he holds to be mental receptivities that constitute 
the sensitive faculty 

space is he says a receptivity for matter in ex 
tension 

time is also a receptivity for matter in succession 

 now according to kant both space and 
time only exist in the mind and constitute two 



kant s 



senses the first of which he calls external and the 
second internal but he does not explain how a 
second being or percipient can exist if he thus 
takes away the outness of space for it is self 
evident that all nature according to this system 
can only exist in the mind of the one person who 
conceives and all other percipients must be only 
modes of the one individual who has such a faculty 
and kant thus reduces every thing to an egoism of 
which his own mind was the centre and boundary 
he is here at the least inconsistent even if we 
could admit of the basis of his system this is per 
haps enough for sense the next division is the 
understanding 



 of various metaphysical categories 



understanding 

 the understanding he takes for another 
reality and conceives that it has four grand divi 
sions to which he gives the names of 

quantity 
quality 
relation 
modality 

respectively under each of these heads he places 
three subdivisions making thus in the whole 
twelve according to mr wirgman but fifteen 
according to the new complete translation of the 
criticjc of pure reason because to those under 
modality we have the opposite set resulting from 
negation that is to say 

impossibility 

nonexistence 

contingence 

these twelve or fifteen terms are according to 
kant real divisions of the understanding which he 
took like sense to mean a real substratum of 
perception they were in his view of his philo 
sophy a sort of original types or standards to 



kant s 

which every thing perceived was referrible and 
which confer their form upon every object in na 
ture they are indeed to be considered as normal 
principles that give a reality and shape to every 
thing to what degree they can be entitled to this 
preeminent and peculiar office the reader will best 
judge from what has already been said and if he 
still believes that the mere figments of the intellect 
which it employs like ciphers to reckon with have 
a separate and independent existence why then he 
can take kant at his word for of course he can 
never hope to comprehend him in detail he must 
not however forget the remarks that i have already 
made on the understanding namely that all 
we can say in any case is we understand and that 
consequently there is no such faculty as the un 
derstanding 



 of various metaphysical categories 



reason 

 reason according to kant unites the 
twelve categories that exist in the understanding 
and which are themselves out of time and space 
into six ideas which are absolute namely 

totality necessity 

limitation cause 

substance concurrence 

he considers reason as a spontaneity or active 
faculty free from time and space in the same 
way as the understanding was out of space 



 such is a brief but i believe accurate 
sketch of the basis of kant s celebrated system if 
we cease to believe in the reality of abstractions 
we can no more think that it is a true representa 
tion of nature than we can that aladdin s palace 
had a real existence and it is as futile to inquire 
into its principles and consequences as it would be 
to speculate on the style of architecture and the

proportions of that celebrated edifice of oriental 
romance throughout his work kant displays 
consummate ingenuity in constructing his dark and 
useless labyrinth and he has cemented the whole 
together into a cyclopean mass by the help of a 
profound knowledge of logical forms that will long 
preserve it as an object of wonder and admiration 
leaving far behind it all other systems for subtlety 
intricacy and darkness and i may add for utter 
uselessness as a metaphysical feat it will in all 
probability never be surpassed but it is merely to 
be considered a cunninglydevised system in 
which logic is abetting realism in an attempt to 
waylay the human understanding of this system 
i said on a former occasion as follows the 
system of kant makes phenomena or the things 
seen to arise from nownenon or what is known 
which two words when released from the juggle of 
grammatical forms imply that we know by seeing 
what we knew by knowing or in plain english we 
know what we knew afterwards by converting this 
tioumenon a passive participle implying what is 
known into something that is the type of our ideas he 
has by the help of realism which he has carried to 
an unprecedented extent and by the use of uncouth 
and obscure terms framed a system so dark and 
complicated that it has served to hoodwink most of 
his own countrymen although it has been rejected 
with one voice by the unsophisticated sense of the

rest of mankind an opinion which i still see no 
reason to alter the admirers of this eminent 
metaphysician may perhaps think that his system 
ought to have been given more in detail but my 
object throughout the whole of these pages is with 
fundamental notions and if these are false of what 
value are the consequences however consistent 
derived from them indeed nothing but the 
great celebrity of kant s system and the fact that 
his categories are its very foundation have led me 
to deviate from the plan i have almost invariably 
followed of merely analysing the materials of meta 
physicians nor indeed is it necessary for kant 
has himself said upon the solution of this problem 
synthetic judgments or upon a satisfactory proof 
that the possibility which it longs to know explained 
cannot at all in fact take place depends now whe 
ther metaphysick falls or stands now as i 

have shown that the very basis of this syn 
thetic judgment is altogether a fallacy it follows 
that the superstructure raised upon it is a mere 
castle built in the air and that it has consequently 
been treated at greater length than it really me

 the whole of these categories from plato 
to schelling the reader must be convinced are only 
so many abstractions of which it will be unneces 
sary for me to say any thing more after all the 
remarks i have previously made on such words 
it is clear therefore that as long as we believe in 
the objective reality of nature we must consider 
them merely as wx et prceterea nihil 






 



conclusion 



 from the preceding observations it is 
evident that metaphysical systems are mere crea 
tures of the fancy and that they are as much in 
contrast with one another as could be expected 
with reference to the nature of their origin the 
low estimate in which they have been held by the 
common sense of the bulk of mankind has not been 
without justice though it has only arisen from a 
sort of blind instinct men may be dazzled by 
what they hear particularly when it is accompanied 
by the charms of a pleasing style and graceful 
imagery but if the foundation be not laid in 
nature it makes no more impression on the mind 
than a passing cloud in summer for nothing can 
produce lasting conviction or create a desire for 
closer acquaintance but what is the very image of 
truth boileau has said most justly 

 ii n y a ricn de beau que le vrai 

 when we hear words that reflect nature 
accurately and beautifully we are conscious that 
our minds are nourished with such wholesome 



 conclusion 

aliment as its healthy condition universally demands 
it is only to the conviction of the inherent truth 
of the abstract sciences that is of their consistency 
with nature that they are cultivated with such plea 
sure and assiduity but take away that conviction 
and they would be as little followed or prized as 
metaphysical speculations which are truly what 
the poet has described them 

 vain wisdom all and false philosophy 

 on the one grand point however to which 
i have directed the reader s attention that is to say 
the true nature of abstract words i must now make 
a few concluding remarks reasoning it must be 
seen is entirely dependent for its existence upon 
abstractions and differs but in its greater variety 
and extent from calculation the last process 

 mathematical science busies itself with deducing by calcula 
tion the laws that depend upon the relations of number and quantity 
in those things of which we are cognisant through our senses but meta 
physics only consider the relations existing between abstractions that 
have no existence except as sounds and which represent nothing in or 
out of nature as a science therefore it is as chimerical as either 
alchymy or astrology though requiring the exercise of powers of 
mind of the highest order indeed arithmetic and mathematics are 
only kinds of metaphysics applied to rational and useful purposes by 
the means of symbols instead of sounds metaphysics therefore may 
be followed as a sort of intellectual gladiatorship or gymnastic disci 
pline tending to give strength and suppleness to the mind and fit it 
for the real combats of life which in comparison will be mere 
pastime 



conclusion 

every one feels is merely effected by symbols and 
the former i believe i have clearly demonstrated 
is accomplished by means precisely similar the 
intellect is as dependent upon such words for its 
efforts as the arm is upon the fingers by which it 
grasps whatever it has the strength to hold up and 
we are as much driven to the use of language by 
instinct as we are to that of our teeth and jaws for 
biting and mastication above all other points 
however the reader should ponder on the wonder 
fully curious nature of abstract words on the prin 
ciple of which we cannot too deeply fix our atten 
tion from its high importance and universality 
we must see that we are impelled by nature to the 
employment of one or more words that are equiva 
lent by usage to the term state and when we 
search for the original of this most mysterious sym 
bol which is in fact whether expressed or under 
stood the foundation of all abstract language we 
find that the human intellect can give no account of 
that by which it is rendered the god of this nether 
world 

 in fine i cannot do better than conclude 
with the following quotation from locke which 
may be considered as the complement of the re 
flection which i have placed at the beginning of 
these remarks and in the justness of which all 
will agree 



 conclusion 

 were the capacities of our understandings ivell con 
sidered the extent of our knowledge once discovered 
and the horizon found which sets the bounds between 
the enlightened and dark parts of things between 
what is and what is not comprehensible by us men 
would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed 
ignorance of the one and employ their thoughts and 
discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the 
other

note a lt 

i nothing can be more delusive than the apparent 
significancy of the terminations ness sjiip hood head c 
if we look for the original of ness we find it in the saxon 
tipe at first sight we might suppose that the termi 
nation in goodness and such words was identical with that 
in sheerness and similar names of places but the latter 
is derived from the saxon nefe a nose implying a pro 
jection of the land similar to the effect of that feature on 
the face in all probability if we had not been able to 
refer to the original distinction between ruffe and nere 
etymologists would have insisted that the termination in 
goodness c had been derived like the names of head 
lands and promontories from nose ship hood head c 
though apparently familiar terms are equally obscure 
ship being derived from the saxon fcip and f cyp and 
the same word is written schap in dutch so the termi 
nations hood and head can be deduced from the saxon 
bab the german hpit and the dutch held and all these 
terminations are equally insignificant in whatever lan 
guage they are found in the sanscrit language abstract 
words are made by such terminations as tvm tv ya 
and tis the first of these has been corrupted into the 
saxon bort and the english dom in freedom c tv has 
 oiven rise apparently to the greek rns and latin tas as 
i in evkorns whiteness and vitvutvs life or livingness the 



 appendix 

tis is evidently corrupted into the greek oj in such word 
as travis state and rogtltr formation c not one o 
these terminations can be traced up to any word having 
meaning if they ever were significant it could only be 
in the earliest antiquity in the arabic language we find 
the termination iyat forming abstracts as kabiliyat 
ability which is derived from kabil able and yet we are 
certain by the genius of the language that this termi 
nation never was significant but is purely artificial 

 in conclusion i have only to repeat that this in 
stance from the arabic is very valuable as tending to 
show that possibly the terminations i have just explained 
may never have had a separate existence as significant 
words in the languages where they are found if the 
mind as i have already said in is led to make this 
jump it might at the same time call up an unmeaning 
sound on an emergency were i for want of the right 
expression in the hurry of conversation to praise alex 
ander s greatsen of soul i might perhaps be nearly as 
well comprehended as if i spoke of his greatness of soul 
if such words ever had a meaning it may have been very 
different from what the sense now requires for we have 
seen in that the sanscrit and arabic languages totally 
differed from the greek and latin in the words they have 
adopted to express the notion of state

 some observations on the hindu and european notions of 
cause and effect 

 a careful consideration of what the hindus have 
said on cause and effect makes it evident that they have 
fallen into the same error as the greeks and modern 
writers on that subject and that they have blended the 
relation of cause and effect with the question of source 



appendix 

and product as well as with that of doer and deed agent 
and act and that they have also used the word cause in 
the sense of efficient maker motive reason origin c as 
is done by our own metaphysicians the latin causa the 
greek curia and the sanscrit iiktu are all simple terms 
the verbal derivation of which is not now obvious so that 
no means remain of defining their actual import by ana 
lysis nor by any ulterior reference but it will be seen 
in the course of the following remarks that this cannot 
be assigned as the reason of the great obscurity and con 
fusion in which the true meaning of these words is in 
volved 

 though mankind by that discrimination with which 
they are commonly endowed not only generally speaking 
use language correctly but immediately feel the impro 
priety of any thing that is contrary to its true analogies 
yet there are very few indeed who could even after some 
labour of thought give any thing like a rational solution 
of the nature of the words they have been employing 
most people if they were asked what they meant by the 
word cause would fly to an illustration and point to a 
thing of some kind as being a cause but this would be 
an error for the word cause implies the relation in 
which the thing stands and riot the thing itself cause 
therefore is merely a general term which the mind 
employs to mark one of the two relations in which any 
thing may under certain circumstances be contemplated 
a word that implies a relation must often by its nature 
have another that is invariably understood and which is 
its correlative attendant thus the term fatlier implies 

 the greek alrta is in all probability derived from the sanscrit heit 
the want of etymological significancy in these words is a proof of their 
antiquity and shows that they were of the first necessity as is also cleir 
from their import the sanscrit karaxa implying the making to do is 
evidently of much later use 



 appendix 

that there is a child husband that there is a wife c 
and by the same analogy cause implies that there must 
be something else which we call an effect but the sense 
of the word thing is complete and absolute in itself 
without the aid of any other word even locke when he 
demies cause as a substance exerting its power into act 
has fallen into this mistake for cause can never be a 
substance but a substance may stand in the relation of 
a cause which is to produce an effect 

 these general distinctions have been premised for 
the purpose of leading the mind of the reader to the true 
consideration of this not unimportant question as the 
fallacies of many of the ablest writers have derived their 
importance solely from the obscurity and confusion in 
which the import of the term cause has been involved 
we have just seen that a substance cannot be a cause 
but that it may stand in the relation of cause therefore 
till there was a mind to perceive the relation between 
events there could be no cause as it is merely a mental 
distinction 

 having thus cleared a way all other imports from the 
word cause except that w r hich really belongs to it namely 
a relation of something that is perceived to be prior to 
another relation that is called an effect we must see that 
when it is employed for source origin reason motive 
efficient agent or maker we are really talking about 

 i have not been able to verify this quotation which is taken from 
johnson s dictionary where it is employed to elucidate the word cause 
but this is of very little consequence as it is only necessary to refer to 
locke s essay on human understanding bk ii ch xxvi to see 
that it is supported by his argument on cause and effect for he says 
there a cause is that which makes any other thing either simple idea sub 
stance or mode begin to be and an effect is that which had its beginning 
from some other thing this definition which applies very well to agent 
and result does not contain any allusion to the conception of relation 
which alone constitutes that of cause and effect 



appendix 

things with which it has no logical affinity when we 
say therefore that god is the first cause of all things we 
mean though we express ourselves incorrectly that he is 
the source or maker of all things when again we talk 
of secondary causes we must intend the subsidiary agents 
or means by which an effect is produced by the same 
analogy we cannot with propriety speak of efficient and 
material causes for the first means an agent capable of 
effecting anything and the second a source from which 
something proceeds and which can have nothing to do with 
the real meaning of cause that is the conception of relation 
between the doer and the deed or the agent and the act 

 the importance of the foregoing distinctions and 
elucidations will be immediately felt when the application 
is made to the arguments of k apfla and the other sdnkhya 
philosophers for when they assert that effects exist in 
their causes and that what exists not can by no ope 
ration of the cause be brought into existence and eluci 
date their meaning by saying that the oil previously 
existed in the seed from which it was expressed we must 
immediately see that by the word cause they intend a 
source from which a production proceeds which is a mere 
truism for undoubtedly without a source there could be 
no production but when they apply it to the divine 
source of all things they beg the question for they might 
as well argue that as every numerical series is composed 
of units a unit must come from something else which 
every one will allow would be nonsense now to con 
tinue this illustration it may be said that just as the unit 
is the admitted starting point of numbers so must the 
deity be the source of all things and all productions 
natural and artificial proceed from his essence as all 
multiples do from the unit

 appendix 

cause has arisen from the very nature of the human mind 
which deriving all its ideas of language from sensible 
objects assimilates every thing to substance and considers 
all abstractions as realities it is on this account that 
employing as we do such words as cause from infancy 
upwards as something real we never arrive at any idea 
of their real import but by close reflection now expe 
rience proves that this is an operation beyond any syste 
matic effort of the generality of mankind and if the 
mind does even occasionally light upon the truth it is 
only as is exemplified in the electric flash which gives a 
momentary gleam to leave us at once in the obscurity in 
which it found us owing to this inveterate and almost 
inevitable mental error and to the consequent confusion 
of ideas we have been led to the invention of a verb 
meaning to cause and we make use of such expressions as 
 he caused him to fall but as the verb to cause in such 
senses means to make to do or to be and therefore implies 
that he made him fall it must express physical agency and 
not abstract relation for when the phrase is properly 
expressed it means he standing in the relation of cause 
made him fall this misuse of language is not of the least 
consequence in the common business of life as it misleads 
no one but it is of the highest importance when we 
reason about fundamental notions as it then becomes the 
source of the worst errors of philosophy deceiving those 
who are considered the infallible authorities of the rest of 
mankind and thereby riveting the human mind in the 
fetters of their own mistakes such being the nature of 
language we cannot hope nor is it possible to alter its 
course but it is incumbent on philosophers to bear its 
imperfections in mind when they attempt to philosophize 
upon the nature of things and to endeavour to prevent it 
from misleading themselves as well as those for whom 
they write 



 jgt i d i x 

 it may however be objected by those who have not 
attended closely to the ten our of these observations that 
cause and effect have always been regarded by philosophic 
writers as standing in a state of relation to one another 
and that as a proof they always speak of the relation of 
cause and effect this is perfectly true but while they 
have so spoken they have always argued as if cause were 
something real instead of a mental conception indeed 
they have converted it by their mode of argumentation 
into an entity or rather a substantiality possessing physical 
agency and capable of producing effects and this is proved 
not merely by the quotation from locke but likewise by 
the use of the verb to cause implying to make to do and 
the noun of action causation signifying the act of making 
to do which such writers employ on the same occasions 
with equal incorrectness by a strange inconsistency 
arising from the deceptive character of language they 
convert the relation of cause into an agent and at the 
same time fancy they employ the verb to cause and the 
noun causation in a manner that only intends relation 
so inveterate are these errors in our way of thinking 
owing to the nature of our minds as well as of language 
and of habit as the consequence of its employment that it 
will require no ordinary effort in the reasoner who may 
attempt to liberate himself from their thraldom and an 
attentive perusal of the arguments that have been adduced 
on the nature of cause and effect by any one who shall 
ceep the foregoing distinction in view will make him feel 
that those stately disquisitions that have been raised on the 
allacy here exposed are often but mere verbiage vox et 
vrffterca niliil or at the best but as the baseless fabric of a 
vision the same kind of fallacy could with ease be shown 
on nearly similar grounds to be the case with all the 
arguments generally used about nature and necessity 

 tliis i have since done and the reader will fi d them of

 appendix 

 the only chance of preventing the errors that have 
been pointed out from being committed by those who are not j 
accustomed to analyse their own thoughts is to remember 
that in ninetynine cases out of a hundred in which the 
word cause is employed it is involved in this fundamental 
error they should therefore always consider when they 
adopt the term whether they use it in any of the many 
senses that have been already pointed out and if so they 
should employ the specific word in its place that is if 
they intend to speak of an agent a maker c they should 
employ those words and no other with respect too to 
the verb to cause and to the noun causation these should 
never be employed in any case where the relation of 
cause and effect is intended as they invariably imply 
physical and not abstract agency and they consequently 
establish the very point of dispute in such cases namely 
the existence of a causer agent or doer which being once 
admitted the whole subject of debate falls to the ground 
as a proof of the importance of the foregoing distinctions 
and observations a few remarks are here added that will 
at once illustrate and confirm their truth and for the 
purpose of pointing out the constancy of the fallacy about 
cause whenever it is adopted by popular usage for an 
agent instead of the conception of relation the word 
causer is made to follow it in brackets were the subject 
clearly and universally comprehended it would save much 
chance of confusion if the word cause were always re 
stricted to the sense of the relation and causer to that 
of the agent or efficient of a result 

when the hindu metaphysicians after the enunciation 
of the rule give the examples by which the exact import 
of the term may be inferred we must see clearly that 
they sometimes employ the word cause as the efficient 
effector producer agent or maker and sometimes as the 
source of production and often as the reason or the 



a ppendix 



motive as well as the origin of anything just as is done 
by the metaphysicians of europe 

 when they say therefore that there is no distinction 
between cause and effect and that effects exist in their 
causes it is clear from the example they give namely 
that the seed of sesamum is the came of tjic oil and that 
therefore the oil existed in its cause which was the seed 
they have palpably confounded agent and source and that 
the seed can neither be considered as standing in the 
relation of cause nor as an agent or causer it is quite 
evident that the oil as a product must have existed in its 
source which was the seed so likewise when they say 
the deity is the efficient cause of the universe they mean that 
he was the agent in producing it and when they say 
he was also its material cause they imply that he was the 
source from which it proceeded now when we assert 
that god made the world we mean to say that he stands 
in the relation of its cause that he is its source and its 
maker which senses are all included in the one word 
creator and by the same reason the world is contem 
plated as an effect of his power as the product of his 
essence and the h ork of his agency the sankhia philo 
sophers therefore in asserting that that which did not 
previously exist could not by any effort of the cause 
causer be brought into existence have by separating the 
cause causer in this case from the source made a petitlo 
principii and proved their own point by the form of the 
enunciation for it will be evident that when we consider 
the cause causer we call first we must not argue as we 
would about the cause causer we contemplate as secon 
dary as we cannot here separate cause causer and source 
though we may do so afterwards for we then know by 
observation that they are distinct thus to borrow a 
hindu illustration the potter is the cause i e causer or 
maker of the pot but he is not the source of the earth 



 appendix 

from which it is formed sometimes however what we 
call a secondary cause causer must include the two dis 
tinctions as when we say the spider spins his web of 
which he is at once the cause causer and the source and 
consequently the web is a work and a product and the 
spider stands in the relation of source to the web which is 
reciprocally in that of product to him but those who 
have been familiarised to the jargon of the schools which 
has been current from aristotle to the present time will 
here perhaps fly from the real scope of this argument 
which is to prove that cause and effect simply imply a 
conception of relation and will say that the oil existed 
potentially in the sesamum just as the fruit existed poten 
tially in the tree and the tree in its seed and the seed in 
the preceding tree and seed c but the fallacy of this 
argument which has nothing to do with the present 
question will be evident by showing that by a similar 
process of reasoning we might say that all the bullets cast 
in a mould existed potentially in the mould as the lead 
poured in is only the equivalent of the nutriment taken in 
by the tree and seed the potentiality which produced 
the bullets existed in the individual who made the mould 
and cast the bullets and the potentiality of the individual 
exists only in god who made and sustains him and the 
same must be said of the tree and seed which have their 
existence from the deity only who is therefore the source 
of all power and of all existence 

 the remarks which are now about to be offered to 
the reader s consideration and to which his attention is 
requested contain the real essence of this question and 
they have been kept back for the purpose of preparing his 
mind for what would have been otherwise unintelligible or 
inconclusive passing over the error that has been pointed 
out of cause being considered as a substance instead of a 
relation it is uniformly thought that in a series of things 



appendix 

acting upon one another the prior is the cause and the 
subsequent the effect thus in a series of balls put in 
motion by the billiard player the first ball is said to be 
the cause and the next the effect to it and the cause to 
the one it strikes and so on till the whole are put in 
movement that this however is not a logical conclusion 
will be evident if we remember that the first ball which 
we call the cause has by its movement only urged on the 
the second and that therefore the effect it produced was 
the movement of the second now if there were fifty 
balls each separately moved by the one that preceded it 
it might be said that there were fifty movements though 
in point of fact we can only say that the fifty balls vere 
moved having got thus far let us consider that it was 
the movement of the first ball that made the second to 
change its place and so communicated an impulse to the 
whole series the moment we see this clearly we must 
be convinced that it was not the first ball but its move 
ment that moved the second and that the movement of 
the second made the next change place till the vhole were 
urged forward in succession in all this operation we 
can not fail to perceive that ve have had fifty effects and 
not one cause for otherwise movement must be both 
cause and effect and if we suppose it so then w r e arrive 
at this conclusion that movement stands in the relation 
of cause to movement which is as much to say that 
movement can produce itself or in plain language that 
change of place can produce change of place to get at the 
cause causer therefore we must go back to the billiard 
player who put the whole in movement now it is evident 
that all the effects witnessed on this or any other occasion 
are simply changea that evidence the passage of something 
that flits from the first to the last and which being propa 
gated by the will of the agent or doer forces the ball on 
till it is arrested in its progress by impinging on the next 



 appendix 

which it moves in its turn the sometliing that operates 
in such changes mankind have agreed to call power 
which as long as we believe in the reality of the external world 
is a real essence capable under direction of effecting all the 
changes that arise from the irill of individual beings or 
the will of god but as matter is seen to be passive or at 
least may be considered so from the uniformity of the law 
of gravitation power is the sole means by which it is set 
in movement when it is once at rest but as power is 
unequal to produce an effect except under direction it 
cannot strictly speaking be held to be a cause causer 
but must be merely considered as the medium by which 
the real cause causer that is the deity carries on all 
the operations observed in nature as all things in nature 
are but results dependent upon the divine will we must 
if we desire to be conclusive in our reasoning admit that 
there is no real cause causer but god who in his cha 
racter of creator forms and sustains all things being both 
the origin and the agent in the production of the universe 
it is he therefore as the source of being that stands in 
the relation of causa causarum to all things for in him 

we live and move and have our being 

 to sum up the inferences to be drawn from the 
preceding argument it may be stated that the definition 
of cause and effect is simply as follows whatever produces 
a change stands in the relation of cause and whatever 
results from it in that of effect 

extracted from the asiatic journal for march 

paragraph was written for the purpose of exposing 
the fallacies resulting from the use of abstract words 
the juggle of thought arises from making the abstract 
term movement mean a reality as is commonly done 
one movement does not produce another it is the power 
passing from the agent into the balls in succession that 
makes them move one after another

note c 

as i think the reader would like to see what dr john 
son has said in his dictionary of the english language on 
the various senses of the word nature i subjoin his epitome 

boyle s notions which he seems to have considered as 
worthy of attention to each i have attached some re 
marks he says 

 of this word which occurs so frequently with signifi 
cations so various and so difficultly defined boyle has 
given an explication which deserves to be epitomised 

 nature sometimes means the author of nature 
or natura naturans as nature hath made man partly cor 
poreal and partly immaterial for nature in this sense 
may be used the word creator 

nature is here evidently employed in a personified 
sense and agrees with the fourth meaning i have as 
signed it see perhaps the word deity or god 
might better represent it than creator j 

 nature sometimes means that on whose account a 
thing is what it is and is called as when we define the 
nature of an angle for nature in this sense may be used 
essence or quality 

the word essence is not altogether inadmissible in this 
case but quality is perfectly erroneous however we 
must feel that it is the property of an angle that is intended 
here by the word nature see and 

 nature sometimes means what belongs to a living 
creature at its nativity or accrues to it by its birth as 
when we say a man is noble by nature or a child is 
naturally forward this may be expressed by saying 
the man was born so or the thing ivas generated such 

this particular sense of nature is that which i have 
included under contrivance in the second meaning i have 
attached to the word see 



 appendix 

 nature sometimes means an internal principle of 
local motion as we say the stone falls or the flame rises 
by nature for this we may say that the motion up or down 
is spontaneous or produced by its proper cause 

nature in this sense implies tendency a meaning 
that has not been assigned to it in my sketch 

 nature sometimes means the established course of 
things corporeal as nature makes the night succeed the 
day this may be termed established order or settled 
course 

this is the same as that i have just commented upon 
above under number one and clearly means nature per 
sonified as an agent the explanation is an oversight 
and does not refer to nature but to that which she is 
supposed to accomplish 

 nature means sometimes the aggregate of the 
powers belonging to a body especially a living one as 
when physicians say that nature is strong or nature left 
to herself will do the cure for this may be used con 
stitution temperament or structure of the body 

this use of nature is also one in which it is personified 
and is therefore the same as numbers one and five of 
boyle being what physicians call the vis medicatrix naturce 
or curative power of nature and also the vis vita or power 
of life 

 nature is put likewise for the system of the cor 
poreal works of god as there is no phrenix or chimera in 
nature for nature thus applied we may use the world 
or the universe 

this is what i have classed as the fifth sense of nature 
as when we sum up every thing under the comprehensive 
terms god and nature see 

 nature is sometimes indeed commonly taken for 
a kind of semideity in this sense it is best not to use it 
at all 



a gt i e n d i x 

here we have nature for the fourth time employed in 
personified sense as we have before had it in numbers 
ne five and six see 

having thus compared the various senses assigned by 
soyle to the w r ord nature it will be seen that he has given 
t four times out of the eight as existing in distinct uses 
rhen it really had but one namely that of a personified 
vord employed as an agent he has not an example of 
he use of this word in the two senses of appearance and 
nateriality it is unnecessary to say any thing more on 
he subject as the reader has now sufficient materials upon 
vhich to form his own judgment

 the consideration of infinity matter space magni 
ude c are sufficient to make us see that human reason 
an form no adequate notion of the real substratum of 
xistence the following remarks which i formerly put 
orth are so much connected with these questions that 
tiey may perhaps be considered deserving of perusal 

of the maxim ex nihtto nihilfic 

 the preceding remarks appear to the writer to be 
ndispensable to the taking a rational view of the cele 
gtrated maxim ex nihilo nihil fit of the ancient greek 
liilosophers for though some of the hindu metaphy 
icians hold the doctrine that nothing conies from nothing 
vhich cannot be disputed and seems at first sight to be 

nearly the same opinion as that of the greeks yet it 
loes in fact essentially differ from it as the first merely 
mplies that without a source there can be no product 
jut it has no reference to an agent or causer while the 
gtther means something more by intimating that no agent 



appendix 



could produce a work without having a source from which 
to elicit his production the opinion of the greeks 
though essentially true in itself as regards any secondary 
cause causer or agent is utterly inapplicable to the 
deity as it assumes the fact that his work that is the 
universe is distinct from his essence and to prove the 
fallacy of such a supposition it is only necessary to con 
sider what would be the inevitable consequences of the 
eternal and absolute existence of matter with a deity 
separate and attempting to operate upon it and this 
may be done without taking into consideration the still 
greater difficulty how either could in that case have had 
any claim to infinity 

 the absurdity of the maxim of the greeks which 
hume justly characterizes as impious consists in sup 
posing a being existing without a cause causer and 
therefore of himself and yet unable to produce matter by 
his fiat a deity so inefficient as the maxim supposes 
him must either have been pure spirit or pure matter or 
a compound of both if we regard him as pure spirit 
but unable to modify matter by his fiat we must imme 
diately admit that he could not have acted upon chaotic 
matter so as to give birth to the universe so likewise if 
we suppose such a deity to be pure matter he must have 
remained like a statue inert powerless and lifeless and 
therefore incapable of creation there remains then but 
the third supposition namely that he was a compound of 
both spirit and matter but such a notion as the last 
implies a selfevident contradiction for as he existed of 
himself without any extraneous cause how could matter 
and spirit become blended in his person if the deity 
being spirit had no power to modify matter by his fiat 
how could he operate upon it so as to give it that form

that was necessary to constitute the corporeity that united 
both natures in his own person namely spirit and matter 
but granting for a moment that such a union could have 
arisen by some sort of process or result incapable of being 
conceived by the human mind he must still have been 
under the necessity of fashioning for himself instruments 
with which to work like a mere mechanic and even then 
it is impossible to conceive how he could regulate the 
birth maturity and decay of universal nature he could 
not himself have escaped the influence of gravitation 
which we must on the hypothesis of his origin suppose to 
be an inherent and indestructible property of matter it 
is likewise evident that a being so constituted could have 
no ubiquity for as he w r ould be composed of matter 
whatever place he occupied would exclude any planetary 
system and he and his work could never have occupied 
the same part of space he must have been either large 
or small if large all the heavenly orbs must by the 
power of gravitation have clustered round him just as 
barnacles attach themselves round a wreck at sea and 
merely added to his mass if small he could have had 
scarcely any influence upon any object larger than him 
self and he must have fallen in by the same force upon 
what he never could have formed in short the diffi 
culties and absurdities attendant upon the supposition of 
the independent and absolute existence of matter are too 
many to admit of its being entertained by any reflecting 
mind that has given the subject a moment of due con 
sideration 

 the sum of the argument amounts to this that 
whether we divide or multiply matter ad infinitum we 
arrive at a contradiction to common sense and we have 
but one conclusion left us from the incomprehensible 
nature of the subject namely that every thing we see 
and feel and think about are but results presented to us

 on the nature of negative and imaginary quantities 

by davies gilbert esq president of the royal society 

 the object of this paper the author observes is one that 
has given rise to much controversy and has been involved 
in much unnecessary mystery paradoxes and apparent 
solecisms when involved with facts and indubitable truths 
will always be found upon accurate examination to be 
near the surface and to owe their existence either to am 
biguities of expression or to the unperceived adoption of 
some extraneous additions or limitations into the compound 
terms employed for definition and which are subsequently 
taken as constituent parts of their essence 

 the first misapprehension pointed out is that of consi 
dering any quantity whatever as negative per se and with 
out reference to another opposed to it which has previously 
been established as positive in order to avoid previously 
formed associations of ideas the author prefers employing 
in his reasonings on this subject the symbols a and 
to express this quality of opposition rather than the usual 
ones of plus and minus by the aid of this notation he is 
enabled to present in its full generalization the law of the 
signs in multiplication a process which it is well known 
is founded solely upon the principle of ratios and to show 
that like signs invariably give the sign belonging to the 
assumed unity or universal antecedent of the ratios and 
unlike signs the contrary 

 since either the one or the other of the arithmetical 
scales derived from the two unities is in itself equally 
affirmative but negative with relation to the other it 



appendix 

follows that by using the scale of b all even roots in 
the scale a will become imaginary and thus the ap 
parent discrimination of the two scales is removed so 
that the properties belonging to the two scales are inter 
changeable and all formula become universally applicable 
to both by changing the signs according to the side in 
which the universal antecedent is taken imaginary quan 
tities then are merely creations of arbitrary definitions 
endowed with properties at the pleasure of him who de 
fines them and the whole dispute respecting their essence 
turns upon the very point that has been contested from 
the earliest times between the hostile sects of realists and 
nominalists 

 it is now however universally agreed that all abs 
tractions and generalizations are mere creatures of the 
reasoning faculty existing nowhere but in the mind con 
templating them such in algebra are the supposed even 
roots of a real quantity taken in the scale opposite to that 
which has given the universal antecedent the sign indi 
cating the extraction impossible to be performed veils the 
real quantity and renders it of no actual value until the 
sign is taken away by an involution the reverse of the 
supposed operation which the sign represents although 
the quantity itself is in the mean time by its arbitrary 
essence made applicable to all the purposes for which real 
quantities are used in every kind of formula 

 several illustrations of these views of the nature of 
imaginary quantities occurring in logarithmic formula 
and series expressing circular arcs are given by the 
author by considering all quantity as affirmative per slt 
and admitting plus and minus merely as correlative terms 
we thus succeed in banishing mystery and paradox from 
the science most powerful in eliciting truth and where 
they ought least to find a place

to the remarks i have made on ideas i am happy to 
add some by burke that i have since discovered and 
which as far as they go confirm all i have said on the 
subject it is to be regretted that a writer so eminently 
qualified for the task did not consider the question in all 
its bearings as the sanction of his name could not have 
failed to draw the attention to it that it so well deserves 
his words are 

 examples that words may affect without raising images 

 i find it very hard to persuade several that their 
passions are affected by words from whence they have no 
ideas and yet harder to convince them that in the ordi 
nary course of conversation we are sufficiently understood 
without raising any images of the things concerning which 
we speak it seems to be an odd subject of dispute with 
any man whether he has ideas in his mind or not of 
this at first view every man in his own forum ought to 
judge without appeal but strange as it may appear we 
are often at a loss to understand what ideas we have of 
things or whether we have any ideas at all upon some 
subjects it even requires a good deal of attention to be 
thoroughly satisfied on this head since i wrote these 
papers i found two very striking instances of the possi 
bility there is that a man may hear words without having 
any idea of the things which they represent and yet after 
wards be capable of returning them to others combined 
in a new way and with great propriety energy and in 
struction the first instance is that of mr blacklock a 
poet blind from his birth few men blessed with the 
most perfect sight can describe visual objects with more 
spirit and justness than this blind man which cannot

possibly be attributed to his having a clearer conception of 
the things he describes than is common to other persons 
mr spence in an elegant preface which he has written to 
the works of this poet reasons very ingeniously and i 
imagine for the most part very rightly upon the cause 
of this very extraordinary phenomenon but i cannot 
altogether agree with him that some improprieties in 
language and thought which occur in these poems have 
arisen from the blind poet s imperfect conception of visual 
objects since such improprieties and much greater may 
be found in writers even of a higher class than mr black 
lock and who notwithstanding possessed the faculty of 
seeing in its full perfection here is a poet doubtless as 
much affected by his own descriptions as any that reads 
them can be and yet he is affected with this strong en 
thusiasm by things of which he neither has nor can 
possibly have any idea further than that of a bare sound 
and why may not those who read his works be affected in 
the same manner that he was with as little of any real 
ideas of the things described the second instance is of 
mr saunderson professor of mathematics in the university 
of cambridge this learned man had acquired great 
knowledge in natural philosophy in astronomy and what 
ever sciences depend upon mathematical skill what was 
the most extraordinary and the most to my purpose he 
gave excellent lectures upon light and colours and this 
man taught others the theory of those ideas which they 
had and which he himself undoubtedly had not but it 
is probable that the words red blue green answered to 
him as well as the ideas of the colour themselves for the 
ideas of greater or lesser degrees of refrangibility being 
applied to these words and the blind man being instructed 
in what other respects they were found to agree or to dis 
aoree it was as easy for him to reason upon the words as 
if he had been fully master of the ideas indeed it must

be owned he could make no new discoveries in the wav 

 

of experiment he did nothing but what we do every 
day in common discourse when i wrote this last sen 
tence and used the words every day and common discourse 
i had no images in my mind of any succession of time 
nor of men in conference with each other nor do i ima 
gine that the reader will have any such ideas on reading 
it neither when i spoke of red or blue and green as 
well as refrangibility had i these several colours or the 
rays of light passing into a different medium and there 
diverted from their course painted before me in the way 
of images i know very well that the mind possesses a 
faculty of raising such images at pleasure but then an 
act of the will is necessary to this and in ordinary con 
versation or reading it is very rarely that any image at 
all is excited in my mind if i say i shall go to italy 
next summer i am well understood yet i believe 
nobody has by this painted in his imagination the exact 
figure of the speaker passing by land or by water or both 
sometimes on horseback sometimes in a carriage with all 
the particulars of the journey still less has he any idea 
of italy the country to which i proposed to go or of the 
greenness of the fields the ripening of the fruits and the 
warmth of the air with the change to this from a different 
season which are the ideas for which the word summer is 
substituted but least of all has he any image from the 
word next for this word stands for the idea of many 
summers vith the exclusion of all but one and surely 
the man who says next summer has no images of such a 
succession and such an exclusion in short it is not only 
of those ideas which are commonly called abstract and of 
which no image at all can be formed but even of par

on this subject in but particularly in g c h

ticular real beings that we converse without having 
any idea of them excited in the imagination as will cer 
tainly appear on a diligent examination of our own minds 
indeed so little does poetry depend for its effect upon the 
power of raising sensible images that i am convinced it 
would lose a very considerable part of its energy if this were 
the necessary result of all description because that union 
of affecting words which is the most powerful of all 
poetical instruments would frequently lose its force along 
with its propriety and consistency if the sensible images 
were always excited there is not perhaps in the whole 
jeneid a more grand and laboured passage than the de 
scription of vulcan s cavern in etna and the works that 
are carried on there virgil dwells particularly on the 
formation of the thunder which he describes unfinished 
under the hammers of the cyclops but what are the 
principles of this extraordinary composition 

trcs imbris torti radios trcs nubis aquosce 
addiderant rutili tres iynis at alitis austri 
fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumqut mctumque 
misccbant opurijlammisque scquacibus iras 

this seems to me admirably sublime yet if we attend 
coolly to the kind of sensible images which a combination 
of ideas of this sort must form the chimeras of madmen 
cannot appear more wild and absurd than such a picture 
 three rays of twisted showers three of watery clouds 
three of fire and three of the winged southwind then 
mixed they in the work terrific lightnings and sound and 
fear and anger with pursuing flames this strange 
composition is formed into a gross body it is hammered 
by the cyclops it is in part polished and partly continues 
rough the truth is if poetry gives us a noble assemblage 
of words corresponding to many noble ideas which are 
connected by circumstances of time or place or related to 
each other as cause and effect or associated in any natural

way they may be moulded together in any form and 
perfectly answer their end the picturesque connection 
is not demanded because no real picture is formed nor 
is the effect of the description at all the less upon this 
account what is said of helen by priam and the old 
men of his council is generally thought to give us the 
highest possible idea of that fatal beauty

they cry d no wonder such celestial charms 
for nine long years have set the world in arms 
what winning graces what majestic mien 
she moves a goddess and she ioks a queen 

pope 

here is not one word said of the particulars of her beauty 
nothing which can in the least help us to any precise idea 
of her person but yet we are much more touched by this 
manner of mentioning her than by those long and la 
boured descriptions of helen whether handed down by 
tradition or formed by fancy which are to be met with 
in some authors i am sure that it affects me much more 
than the minute description which spenser has given of 
belphebe though i own mlt ie are parts in that de 
scription as there are in all the descriptions of that 
excellent writer extremely fine and poetical the terrible 
picture which lucretius has drawn of religion in order 
to display the magnanimity of his philosophical hero in 
opposing her is thought to be designed with great bold 
ness and spirit 

humana ante oculosfceda cum vitajaceret 
in terris oppressa gravi sub religione 
quee caput e cceli regionibus ostendebat 
horribili desuper visu mortalibus instans 
primus grains homo mortales tollere contra

what idea do you derive from so excellent a picture 
none at all most certainly neither has the poet said a 
single word which might in the least serve to mark a 
single limb or feature of the phantom which he intended 
to represent in all the horrors imagination can conceive 
in reality poetry and rhetoric do not succeed in exact 
description so well as painting does their business is to 
affect rather by sympathy than imitation to display 
rather the effect of things on the mind of the speaker or 
of others than to present a clear idea of the things them 
selves this is their most extensive province and that in 
which they succeed the best
