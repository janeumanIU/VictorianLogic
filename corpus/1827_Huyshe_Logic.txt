the author of the following pages is
aware that it may be deemed not a little
presumptuous to offer to the public a
treatise on logic more particularly at
the present time when two publications
on this science have so lately made
their appearance he trusts therefore
that he shall be pardoned if he briefly
states the reasons which gave rise to
the present volume aldrichs logic has
been long and deservedly held in high
estimation but it seems to be generally
admitted that it is too concise and too full
of technicalities to be easily intelligible
to a beginner many of these difficulties
have been removed by dr whately in

though it contains a very admirable dis
sertation on the science and proves
that its author was completely master
of his subject yet is more adapted to
those who have made some progress in
the study added to which its length
 would be likely to daunt the young stu
dent
of the treatise lately published by
mr bentham entitled outline of a
new system of logic little need here
be said especially as it has been no
ticed in some of the following pages 
suffice it to observe that he utterly
condemns and wishes to annihilate the
whole aristotelian system as being
 more or less complicated and incom
prehensible in order to pave the way
for a new system of his own which

tols with no usual praises he finds fault
with the aristotelian system and espe cially with dr whatelys work be
cause it is so replete with technical
phraseology forgetting that his own
 outline is liable to recrimination as
containing more technicalities and also
as being possessed of an amazing num
ber of newcoined words which it is
impossible to understand and almost
impossible even to pronounce
the present treatise is intended to
assist those who wish to study aldrichs
logic in order to pass their examination
in the oxford schools the authors
sole endeavour has been to render the
study of the science as easy as he
could and he has freely made use of

on the operations of the mind

there are three operations of the mind√¢Äî operations of
the mind
simple apprehension judgement and discourse
or reasoning
simple
apprehension
is the mere intellectual simple
ap√¢ñ†
x √¢ñ†
prehension 
conception of a thing it is sometimes termed
perception because the apprehension of the
mind was thought
to be analogous
to per analogous
to what

ox
ception by the senses thus it was imagined
that by apprehension an idea of any object
was imprinted on the mind just as its image
was by sight on the eye the result of this i√¢ result
operation is properly termed a notion or me
taphorically an image idea representation or
conception
there are two kinds of simple apprehen tw kindssion viz incomplex and complex
b

prehension

judgement

on the operations

simple incomplex apprehension is the con
ception of one object or of many taken con
fuse i e without any grammatical relation
to each other a it is by this kind of appre
hension that the mind gains the ideas repre
sented by each word in any sentence when
taken separately
complex apprehension is the conception of
several objects taken with a certain order and
reference to each other and it is by this
kind of apprehension that the mind under
stands the meaning of all the words of a sen
tence taken collectively√¢Äîor in other words
the complex idea which that sentence may
intend to convey
of these two kinds of apprehension the incomplex is prior in point of time
judgement b is the decision on the agreea any one word whether representative of a simple or a com
pound idea denotes an incomplex simple apprehension in its
logical sense so also any number of words when combined so
as to form a sentence become representatives of complex appre
hension though as mr bentham justly observes outline of
a new system of logic p every conception of any really
existing object is complex that of a man just as much as of a
man on horseback for each of these is composed of a great
number of simple conceptions a simple conception is that of a
single property that of colour for instance without those of
form of extent or any other it is the result of an operation of
the abstractive faculty
b dr whately p defines judgement to be the com
paring together in the mind two of the notions or ideas which

of the mind



ment or disagreement of any two objects when
compared with each other and until this de
cision is made judgement cannot be said to be
formed
there are two kinds of judgement qffirma √¢ñ†√¢ √¢√¢Ä¢√¢√¢ñ†
tive and negative
affirmative judgement which is also termed
composition is that which expresses the agree
ment of the two objects which were compared
negative judgement or division expresses
their mutual disagreement
 √¢ñ†
the copula is that which indicates the act copula
of judgement viz it serves to express the
agreement or disagreement of two objects it
is the substantive verb alone in its present
tense and is either affirmative or negative
it is by deciding whether the affirmative difference between judge

copula est or the negative non est should mplp
be applied that judgement differs from com prehnsonare the objects of apprehension whether complex or incomplex
and pronouncing that they agree or disagree with each other 
or that one of them belongs or does not belong to the other
he thus considers the comparison as much a part of judgement
as the decision itself√¢Äîwhereas the latter is the result of the
former for the object of comparison is to pronounce a judge
ment on the relations which the objects compared may have to
each other mr bentharn says judgement usually pronounces
either the degree of belief attached by our intellectual mind to√¢Äî
 or the degree of pleasure or pain produced in our sensitive
minds by√¢Äîan impression or an idea it is an instantaneous
operation which accompanies and forms part of that of every
other intellectual faculty

b



on the operations

plex apprehension for the mere act of under
standing the sense conveyed by any assertion
whether affirmative or not is the office of com
plex apprehension but in judgement the mind
not only understands the meaning of the asser
tion but by determining the copula shows that
it acquiesces in or dissents from that assertion
use of the
since the copula serves to indicate the
agreement or disagreement of two objects it
is obvious that the affirmative copula expresses
their agreement and the negative their dis
agreement thus the soul is immortal is
an affirmative judgement and the earth is
not stationary is a negative judgement
reasoning
reasoning or discourse is the motion or
progress of the mind from one or more judge
ments to another resulting from them it is
also termed ratiocination and it is expressed
or signified by some illative viz inferential
particle as hence ifierefore consequently etc 
thus
nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit 
ego sum mortaiis 
ergo non omnibus horis sapio
c care must be taken not to confound reason with reasoning
for reason in its common acceptation signifies that use of
the faculties of the mind which distinguishes man from any
other animal viz it is the characteristic of man but
reasoning or ratiocination discursus is the process of in
ferring a proposition or conclusion as necessarily resulting from
one or more other propositions

of the mind

o

owing to the weakness of human nature the the mental
m
operations
mind of man is fallible and its operations are lible to deconsequently liable to certain errors or defects
the error incidental to apprehension is termed
indistinctness that of judgement falsity and
of reasoning a faulty mode of inferring
thus mans ideas of eternity omnipotence in instances

of these dejinity must be indistinct so if i were to de 
cide that the sun moves round the earth
my judgement would be false and if from
these two judgements viz qui sapit pauca
loquitur and pauca loquor i were to de
duce this third judgement sapio the in √¢Ä¢
ference would be erroneous
in order to obviate these defects certain wly losic
was taught
rules have been laid down the knowledge of
which is termed logic or the art of reasonins it is defined to be ars instrumen jotfc √¢Ä¢√¢ñ†

talis dirigens mentem in cognitione rerum
for logic when applied to practice becomes

d the words mendosa collectio do not exactly mean er
roneous inference as they are most frequently translated but
rather a faulty arrangement of the terms of an argument
this will be more clearly shown in the third part of logic
e every art must have its corresponding science for a science
is engaged about knowledge whilst an art is the knowledge of a
science applied to jrraetice thus logic is a science when con
versant solely about the theory of reasoning but when applied

an art

on the operations of the mind

an art and since it is not studied for its own
sake but with a view to some ulterior object
it is not a final or master art but an instrumental or subordinate art the object which
logic has in view is to direct the mind
in the attainment of knowledge f and the

to practice it becomes an art and it is from not having a due
consideration of this circumstance that much perplexity has
arisen see mr benthams outline of a new system of logic
p 
mr bentham says p there cannot exist a single art
that has not its corresponding science nor a single science which
is not accompanied by some portion of art
 few sciences have fallen into such disrepute as that of logic
the sole cause of which has been the error into which even lo
gicians themselves have fallen respecting the true nature of it 
and thus the censure due to those who caused the error has
fallen upon the science itself many have supposed that logic
was a science the object of which would be the attainment of
knowledge not remembering that it would be utterly impossible
for any science to effect such a thing for how could any rules
be laid for guiding the human judgement or instilling clear
ideas into the mind logic cannot give any rules for asceitaining whether all propositions are true or not inasmuch as
such facts depend on circumstances wholly unconnected with the
science the truth or falsehood of a proposition depends upon
that science to which the subjectmatter of the proposition belongs
logic lays down certain rules as tests of the validity of any argu
ment as far only as theform of its expression is concerned it
does not profess to cotvmunicate any knowledge but to guide and
direct the mind in the acquisition of knowledge it cannot sup
ply mental faculties to those who have them not so neither could

means which it adopts to attain that object are how attained
 the showing the proper use of words for
since in reasoning terms may be indistinct
propositions false and arguments fallacious 
hence by remedying these defects i e by
showing the proper use of language logic does
guide and direct the mind in the attainment of
knowledge
since there are three operations
of the mind three

of logic
and consequently three defects to correct hence
also there are three parts of logic

 a word is a sign i e it is a token of the
existence of some thing or idea meant to be
represented by it

 a word is the sign of a thing because it

does serve to represent the particular object
which that word conveys to the mind of the

it supplies the place of that object or primo

acts as a substitute for that very object itself
an arbitrary

requires the mutual agreement of men in order
to acquire any signification
sounds therefore which are suggested by na

that they should express the ideas or objects intended if this
were the case all languages would have the same words to ex
press the same ideas which is not the case for the same
sound conveys different ideas in different languages and not
only in different but in the same language as is the case with
equivocal words

ture such as sighs groans shrieks etc are not natural
sounds arcwords for they are not formed ex instituto n√¢t words
as there are three mental operations there three kinds

of words
are three kinds of words expressive of them 
those which express simple apprehension are
called simple words those which express judge
ment complex those which express discursus
decomplex
every decomplex word consists of three com
plex and every complex word of three simple
words for a complex word which is com
monly called a proposition consists of the component
parts of a
subject i e that concerning which something proposition
else is said √¢∞z the predicate i e that
which is said of another and the copula
which comes between the subject and predi since from the definition of judgement the word expres
sive of it must consist of some combination of simple words
hence has arisen the term complex word also since the word
expressive of discursus must be a certain combination of complex
words hence it is termed decomplex i e doubly complex
k it should be remembered that the copula is the substantive
verb in the present tense whenever therefore the copula be
found in a proposition in the past or future tenses such a fact
is to be regarded only as necessary for making the sentence
grammatical or if any modification of time be intended this
must particularly be specified by the introduction of always
 at such a time or some similar expression for no conclu
sion could logically be inferred under such circumstances unless
the exact time intended be fixed on this point see mr
benthams outline p note



on words

cate it frequently happens that these three
words are united in one e g loquor viz
 ego sum loquens or the copula is joined to
the predicate as cats eat mice i e cats
are animals which eat mice or they may be
composed of a great number of grammatical
words as the opening of this epistle ex
hibits a connexion with the history which
alone would satisfy my mind that the epistle
was written by st paul and by st paul in
the situation in which the history places him
the whole of this sentence consists of but one
proposition the subject of which is the
opening of this epistle the copula is and
 an opening which exhibits a connexion etc
is the predicate
subject and
the subject ought to be the first word in
√¢Ä¢ometimes every proposition and the predicate the last
transposed


but this verbal arrangement is sometimes
changed thus in the following examples the
predicate stands first in the propositions and
the grammatical words which compose the sub
ject and predicate are united by a hyphen the

 an infinitive mood is never the predicate unless where two
infinitives occur in one proposition e g to do good to all
men is to act according to the dictates of christianity to take
an undue advantage over another is not to act the part of a true

on the divisions of nouns

as the subject or predicate of a proposition
and such words are nouns substantive in the
nominative case as well as verbs in the in
finitive mood which see dr whately p 
are properly nouns substantive no nouns
therefore in the oblique cases can be categorematics m
syncategorematic words are such as in sense
can form only a part of the subject or pre
dicate as adjectives nouns in oblique cases
verbs and other parts of speech for though
an adjective is often used as the predicate of a
proposition yet some substantive must always
be considered as understood and implied though
not expressed
m a categorematic word need not be one grammatical word 
e g man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to
live man that is born of a woman is the subject
and is one categorematic word and a being that hath but
 a short time to live is the predicate and is also only one
categorematic word
i this fact is denied by dr whately p but i am of
opinion that an adjective cannot ever be strictly said to be the
predicate of a proposition and this may be shown to be the fact
by converting a proposition in which the predicate is expressed
adjectively e g some men are learned the simple con
verse of which is some learned beings are men in which
 beings or some such word must be expressed in order that
the proposition when converted may be grammatical now
since conversion is the transposition of the extremes of a proposi
tion without any change in the extremes themselves the word
 beings must have been implied though it was not expressed
in the predicate of the converted proposition

mixed words are such as are formed by mixed word√¢
some combination of the two other species
and of these there may be three classes exam
ples of which are given in aldrich c √¢ß 
the first semper being compounded of two
syncategorematics the second nemo of a

there are many divisions of logical nouns
three of which are most necessary to be obwhich most served viz the common unifocal and noun

anj common

 a word which is significant and inexpressive of relation or
time thus excluding adjectives and nouns in oblique cases
 the division of nouns into singular and common is the true
division of nouns inasmuch as it comprehends the whole class 
for every noun must either be singular or common the other
divisions are not so much the divisions of nouns as the different
modes of employing the same noun for these divisions of
nouns into positive privative and negative are not really dif
ferent divisions of the nouns themselves but rather the different
modes of employing the same noun for a noun may be used
both relatively and oppositely or equivocally or analogously 
as may be shown by the following example
thus for instance the word bull may be used equi
vocally for it may signify an animal or a blunder in an
expression two ideas which apparently have not any ana
logy to each other so when considered as meaning an ani
mal only it will be univocally used for then its one signifi
cation which is that of an animal will be applicable in the
same sense to many objects again when it is used to signify

√¢Ä¢√¢Ä¢

on the divisions of nouns



the singular noun speaks of individuals
alone the common noun of a whole class of in
dividuals and is applicable to every individual
of that class inasmuch as it comprehends them
in its signification thus oxford lon
don bristol are singular nouns because
they express or stand for individuals and
 city town etc are common nouns and
they not only represent the whole class which
they express but are likewise applicable to
 oxford london bristol etc which
are individuals comprehended in those classes
n b every thing which has actual exist
ence is represented by a singular noun a
common noun does not represent a thing which
has actual existence but an idea or nature
common to many individuals i e that idea
which is the result of the abstractive faculty
see section iv
a common noun may be considered as sin common
nouns used
gular when a sign of singularity is affixed to it as singulars
thus he is gone to the river meaning the
isis river would here be considered as a
singular noun because its signification applies singular

its signification to many individuals the

definite and
a definite noun is such as has not the parindefinite

tide nont prefixed to it the indefinite is that
to which the particle non is prefixed thus
 that quadruped is not a dog dog is here
used indefinitely for since it is predicated of
that certain quadruped that it is not a dog
the class dog alone is excluded and it remains
wholly undefined to what other class of qua
drupeds it may belong
positive
privative

the positive noun speaks of a thing as it
m

and negative were present i e possessed by any subject
the privative denotes the absence of a thing
from a subject capable of possessing it and the
negative denotes the absence of a thing from a
subject incapable of possessing it thus ra
tional is spoken positively unlearned privatively of man and irrational is spoken ne
gatively of brutes
again positive a man of sense
privative a senseless boy
negative a senseless stone
the particle rum is consequently called indefinitant be
cause when prefixed to a noun it renders that noun indefinite
for the use of the definite and indefinite nouns in division see

fication and in each signification is equally ap
plicable to many objects such as post bull
mail etc such words are an imperfection in

convey two distinct ideas the result of which
must be frequent mistakes
analogous nouns are such as have but one anaiagous
nouns
signification but in that one signification they
are unequally viz with unequal propriety ap
plied to many things when any objects are
united by some resemblance which they bear
to each other the same word is often used to
apply to them which word is called analogous
as a vein in the body and a vein of metal 
where the resemblance is obvious analogous
nouns are also used to represent any two or
more objects which have no resemblance to
each other as a sour apple and a sour
s thus the word dog is an univocal word and is applicable
in the same signification to many dogs equivocal words are
such as are the same in sound but convey different ideas as
the words mail which signifies armour and the postbag and
page which signifies either the side of a leaf in a book or an
attendant fallacies often result from using such words these
fallacies are termed fallacia equivocalionis see dr whately

in which that quality exists as prudent wise
abstract
abstract nouns express a quality by itself

concrete nouns are not always adjectives

an absolute noun is that whose sense is cor
relative
nouns
plete in itself and does not imply a relation
 prudent is a concrete noun because it cannot be used with
out at the same time implying or referring to the being who is
possessed of that quality but prudence is an abstract noun and
may be used without any reference whatsoever to the subject
which is possessed of it it is a word which expresses an ab
stract idea
u it may perhaps be questioned whether all concrete nouns
are not strictly adjectives though substantively used but this
is a question of no importance as far as regards logic it has
before been shown that the same word may be used univocally 
equivocally and analogously so also the same word may lie
considered as relative opposite etc e g brother is the con
crete to fraternity and it may also be regarded as a relative
noun for it suggests the idea of its correlative sister so again
great and small are relative nouns and they may be regarded
also as opposite for they caunot both be predicated of the same
thing at the same time this is the case with many nouns

to any other thing the relative noun implies
the idea of its correlative as husband which
implies the idea of wife

which cannot be said of any one object at the

be at the same time both swift and slow at
different times opposite nouns may be predicated
of the same object thus a horse may be said to
be tractable today and intractable tomorrow
the first intention of a word is its common nouns of first
signification i e its vague colloquial meaning intention
its second intention is its strict and definite
sense limited as may be required when it is
used in any particular science or art when
therefore we speak logically all words are
limited in their signification and may conse
quently be considered as in their second inten
tion as the same word may be used in many
different sciences and in different significations
 the first intention of a word is its common and colloquial
sense which is opposed to the more limited and accurate signi
fication in which it is used in any particular science and which
is termed its second intention thus when we speak accurately
and logically every word will be used in a secondary meaning 
in fact any word which is applied in a limited sense in an ar
gument may be considered as used in a second intention



on the divisions of nouns

it is evident that such a word will have as many
second intentions as there are sciences in which
many second it is used thus the word triangle in matheintentions to

matics is a plane rectilineal figure contained
hy three straight lines but in music it signi

section iv
a singular noun y is also termed in logic of singula
indivisible because it is incapable of being
logically divided inasmuch as its signification
extends to one object and one only i e its
object is numerically one but nevertheless
whatever can be called one is not therefore
necessarily singular for many things which
possess any common quality may as far as
that resemblance goes be considered as one
in sense though not one in number and thus
one common name may be assigned to them
which as far as they resemble each other
will be applicable to any one or to all of them
i singular nouns which denote any one individual object
cannot be affirmatively predicated of any thing except them
selves i e they cannot be the predicate of any affirmative pro
position unless its subject be a word expressive of that same
individual object which the singular noun represents thus
this university and oxford are singular nouns which cannot be
predicated of any thing but themselves for we may say lais
university is oxford but we cannot predicate of any other uni
versity that it is oxford singular nouns may be used as the
predicate of any negative proposition whose subject does not ex
press the same individual object e g london is not oxford etc
common nouns denote a whole class and any individual in
that class and consequently may be predicated of all or of any
 of those individuals thus university city are common
nouns and we may predicate of oxford that it is an university
or that it is a city for oxford is an individual which is compre
hended under each of those common nouns



on the formation

abstraction this operation is termed abstraction which
its deflni is defined to be that faculty of the mind by
which in the contemplation of many singulars
or individuals it neglects all those points in
which the singulars differ from each other
regarding those only in which they agree
its result the result of such an operation is an abstract
idea i e the idea of an universal nature which
extends over many individuals not being dif
ferent in each but the same in all hence it
is termed universale or ens unum in multis
the word expressive of such an abstract idea
a predicabie is termed a predicable because such universal
nature may be affirmatively predicated of each
z when in contemplating any individual object we consider
any one property or quality which that individual may possess
to the exclusion of all its other qualities we are said to abstract
this quality thus if in looking at any individual horse we
should regard only the property of his having four legs exclud
ing all thoughts respecting his colour height temper etc we
should be employing the faculty of abstraction but if we con
template many horses and from finding that they are all fourlegged animals we give to them a common name which may
as far as they agree with each other be applicable to all or
each of them as quadruped we are then employing what is
termed generalization such generalization may obviously be
carried to almost any extent by considering such common nouns
as for instance quadruped as singulars and by abstracting
their differences we shall thus arrive at new aggregates and at
some more universal term thus by abstraction from quadruped
we should arrive at the more common term animal so from
animal we should gain the still more universal term corporeal
being and so on

of predicables



of those singulars and of them all collectively
such a common terma or predicable is defined iudennition
to be nomen commune univocum secundce
intentionis or a common univocal noun of
the second intention for this common noun
although applicable to many individuals is
considered as representative of only one idea 
hence it is univocal and since a word when
thus applied is not used in a vague but limited
and definite sense it is also said to be a word
of the second intention
this abstract nature does not denote any
reallyexisting thing nor can it be supposed to
exist unless combined with some singulars
the motive for conceiving it to exist is merely n object
with a view to generalization b and classifica

 the idea expressed by a common term is as dr whately
observes p merely an inadequate or incomplete notion
of an individual and from the very circumstance of its in
adequacy it will apply equally well to any one of several indi
viduals e g if i when considering oiford were to omit all
consideration of any of those circumstances and accidents which
are peculiar to oxford and distinguish it from any other city
the notion which i have thus formed of oxford which is ex
pressed by a common term city is evidently an inadequate and
incomplete notion of it for such common term is as applicable to
any other city as to oxford and therefore inadequately ex
presses it because it does not imply or designate any of its
peculiarities
b abstraction may exist without any generalization the for
mer may be employed on one individual only for we may re

the essence c of any thing is that which

makes it to be what it is if therefore it be
deprived of its essence or of any part of it it
no longer exists as it was this essence is not
reallyexisting but is an imaginary nature the

parts viz that part of an essence which is
common to it as well as to other essences which
material part is also called the material part or genus and
or genus


that part which is not common to any other
essence but is peculiar to this one essence
and distinguishes it from all others and con
stitutes it what it is this part is called the

sess to the exclusion of all others which is abstraction but
in order to employ generalization we must abstract some one
quality from a great many individuals and denote this quality
by some common name which as far as this resemblance goes

d mr bentham p says the differentia or character
istic is a species of property not distinct from it it is exactly
that which belongs necessarily to an entity√¢Äînecessarily in the
ordinary sense of the word though in the sense here given to it
which is that of universally this may not be the case now
putting aside the last clause of this sentence the meaning of
which i confess that i cannot understand i should not be in
clined to admit that the differentia is exactly that which be
longs necessarily to an entity it does not necessarily belong to
or result from an essence but it is an actuallyconstituting part
of that essence and must therefore be distinct from property
which does not form a part of an essence but only necessarily
hows and results from it mr bentham wishes to prove that
 differentia is not distinct from property and therefore he
begs the question viz that differentia is exactly that which
belongs necessarily to an entity which if he had proved his
conclusion might have had more pretensions to accuracy
again he says in the same page if we are assured that
a property is universal it becomes essential and characteristic
and p the property of having ten fingers for instance
amounts almost to what we should call an universal property 
yet it is not essential for if a man had but nine he would still
be a man now even if it were conceded that every uni
versal property must also be essential to disprove which pro
position would not be very difficult i would ask mr bentham
what meaning he gives or intends to give to the word assured
as he has used it and also in what manner it qualifies his asser
tion for the fact of an universal property becoming essen
tial seems to depend on the degree of assurance or as i
suppose confidence amounting almost to certainty which we
may possess of its universality i am and i doubt not but
that the generality of men are as well assured that man is a
tenfingered animal as that he is a rational one the property
of having ten fingers may justly be termed not almost but alto
gether an universal property there may have existed and per
haps there now do exist men with more or less than ten fingers

to any essence different qualities may be observed to be joined and of such qualities there

of two kinds may be two kinds for they may either be nebut such facts do not disprove the universality of the property 
so neither could it be argued that rationality was not peculiar
to man because there are some idiots in the world wholly desti
tute of that characteristic the fact is that every property
strictly so called is universal and as dr whately very cor
rectly observes p a property is that which is necessarily
joined to the whole essence i e to the whole species or in other
words universally to every individual of it

cessarily jbined to the essence or only con
tingently i e accidentally such as are ne
cessarily joined to any essence are termed
properties and such as are only contingently properties
or accidentally joined are called accidents eg accident
 the having three angles is a property of
a triangle for it necessarily accompanies its
essence or as dr whately says it is the
result of the differentia so the being
equilateral rightangled etc are accidents
to a triangle for such qualities do not of neces
sity belong to triangles the absence of which
would not affect the essence or species for
dr whately p every accident must
be separable from the species else it would
be a property
e properties are those qualities which are predicated of any
essence as necessarily joined to it but it must not therefore be
supposed that no property can be separated from its essence for
this may frequently be the case particularly with such proper
ties as may be termed physical properties e g the property of
a mans having ten jingers two legs two arms etc such pro
perties are actually separable from the individuals who possess
them for they may be cut off without injuring the essence or
even existence of such individuals but this is not the case with
other properties which may be termed ideal properties such
properties have not any actual existence and do not admit of
any beparation from the essence of which they are predicated 
c g risibility in a man and the having three angles in a tri
angle and such a property dr whately observes p 
 it is often hard to distinguish from the differentia but what
ever you consider as the most essential to the nature of a species
with respect to the matter you are engaged in you must call the



five head of
predicables

on the species

from the foregoing considerations it is ma√¢∞
√¢∞
nifest that there can be but five heads of pre
dicables for whatever can be asserted of many
things must be predicated either as their whole
essence or as a part of their essence or as
joined to their essence√¢Äîwhence will arise these
five heads f





species or the whole essence
genus or the common part of the essence
differentia or the formal part
property or something necessarily joined
to the essence
 accident or something accidentally joined
to the essence

differentia as rationality to man and whatever you consider
as rather an accompaniment or result of that difference you
must call the property as the use of speech seems to be a result
of rationality and note p that the difference is not
always one quality but is frequently compounded of several
together no one of which would alone suffice for the dis
tinction between a property and an accident see note n p 
 it should be borne in mind that each of these heads of pre
dicables are relative terms for that which is a genus if predi
cated of some things will be a species when predicated of
others or a property or an accident etc for we cannot say
what predicable any term is or whether it is any at all unless it
be specified of what it is to be predicated eg the term red
would be considered a genus in relation to the terms pink
scarlet etc it might be regarded as the differentia in relation
to redrose as a property of blood as an accident of a house
etc√¢Äîwhately p 

of predicables



these predicables therefore are predicated or
asserted of those things in which there is sup
posed to exist that abstract nature of which
such predicable is the representative thus
the genus which is the material or common
part of many essences or species is predicated
of many things differing in species i e it is
predicated of those different species which it
includes under its more extensive signification
thus figure is predicated of triangles circles
squares etc which differ in species but spe
cies is predicated of things differing from each
other in number i e of those individuals
each of which possesses an essence signified
by the word which expresses the species
 the other three heads of predicables viz
differentia property and accident are predi
cated of things differing as well in number as
in species because they have a relation either
to a genus or a species if to a genus they
can be predicated of all the species which that
genus contains and if they have a reference
to a species they can be predicated of all the
different individuals of that species
genus and species are commonly said to be
predicated in quid thus if the question be
asked quid est illud the answer must be
returned by stating its genus or species dif
ference is predicated in quale quid and pro
d

perty and accident in quale hence we may
easily form the usual definitions of the five
heads of predicables g
definition

genus is a predicable predicated in quid

of many things differing in species as the ma
terial or common part of their essence
of difference
difference is a predicable which is predicated

of species

in quale quid of many things differing either
in number or in species as the distinguishing
part of their essence
species is a predicable which is predicated

in quid of many things differing in number
as the whole of their essence

property is a predicable which is predicated
in quale of many things differing in species
or in number as necessarily joined to their
essence
of accident
accident is a predicable which is predicated

genus a

in quale of many things differing in species
or in number as contingently joined to their
essence
genus is called a logical wholei because it

logical whole

is the most comprehensive term in its significa it must be remembered that the predicable and the uni
versal are not one and the same for the former is the sign ex
pressive of the latter the predicable is that which is asserted
of many and the universal is one nature existing in many
h a logical whole is that term which has the most extensive
signification a metaphysical whole is the most comprehensive
term hence genus is a logical whole for it contains the spe

tion and contains species as its subject parts 
viz includes it under its own more extensive
signification for the genus may be affirma
tively predicated of all its contained spe
cies e g

fmen



i beasts
all birds j are animals
fishes
insects
thus animal is the logical whole and men
beasts etc are its subject parts
species being the whole essence necessarily specie 

metaphysical
implies the genus which is a part of that es wioie
sence it is a more complete and comprehen
sive term than genus and is therefore termed
cies but species is a metaphysical whole inasmuch as it im
plies the genus genus expresses a less comprehensive idea
than species for the species denotes the whole essence i e a
complex idea formed by the union of the less complex notions
of the genus and the difference
 mr bentham p says as to predicating the whole
essence of a subject in one term that is impossible unless that
term be a strict synonyme dr whately does not appear to
have been aware of this he implies that if we predicate the
genus we predicate a part of the essence if the species we
predicate the whole essence considering species in the sense in
which naturalists employ the word in which case it is in fact a
logical genus with reference to individuals if i predicate 
says he of caesar that he is an animal i say the truth indeed
but not the whole truth for he is not only an animal but a
man but this is not yet the whole truth for he is not only a

on the species of predicables

a metaphysical whole e g man is a metaphy
sical whole and implies rational animal
the difference is said to divide the genus
because when added to the genus it forms dif
ferent species and thus divides as it were the
genus into its subject species and as the dif
ference when added to the genus makes up the
species hence it is said to constitute the spe
cies inasmuch as it completes its essence
man but a white man not only a white man but a roman 
and so on till we come to the individual caesar can mr
bentham really suppose that the being a white man and a
roman are any parts of the ideal essence of caesar when dr
whately says that if he predicates of cassar that he is a man
he predicates the whole truth let us see what the whole truth
is and what dr whately intends by it the whole essence i e
the species means the whole of the ideal parts of the essence 
and therefore dr whately does predicate the whole truth when
he predicates of caesar that he is a man for he predicates the
whole of his ideal essence to be a white man and a roman
are accidents inseparably joined to the essence of that individual
caesar nor can they strictly be considered as parts of that
essence it is therefore very possible to predicate the whole es
sence of any subject in one term even though that term be not a
synonyme for by predicating the species we do predicate the
whole ideal essence and this is what is meant by dr whately
the two ideal parts of the essence are the genus and the dif
ferentia the union of which makes up the whole ideal essence

two kinds of

there are two kinds of genus viz genus
minimum and genus subaltern
two kinds of there are also two kinds of species viz
species subaltern and species infima
summum
summum genus cannot be the subject of any
genus
cognate genus it is the highest and most
extensive term that can be imagined and there
is not any superior genus under which it may
be classed it is in short the most abstract
notion that the human mind can conceive
genus

 k summum genus in its strictest sense is that allextensive
term under which every object of whatever kind may be classed
and of every one of which it may be affirmatively predicated 
the word which is generally used to denote such genus is subslance or as some call it being such is summum genus in its
strict sense but many other genera are frequently used as
summa genera according as may be most suitable to any par
ticular science or system thus by an ornithologist bird would
be regarded as the summum genus under which he would ar
range the different subdivisions of birds so fish would be re
garded as the summum genus most applicable to the study of
ichthyology and this is the case with various other sciences
the general heads or summa genera to some of which we
may refer every term are denominated the categories or predi
caments the doctrine of which was first taught by archytas 
they are generally considered as ten in number viz substance
quantity quality relation place time situation possession
action suffering the greek terms which aristotle has given
them are as follows obaia iroaov iroiov rpoc rt irov wort
ktloqai ixtivi irouiv √¢ñ†kcusytiv to some one of these heads
we may refer every term according as may best suit our pur
pose for the argument in which we may be engaged

and may be affirmatively predicated of every
idea and every object
infima species may be the subject of every infima
cognate genus it is the first common nature
which is the result of any abstraction it can
not be considered as a genus with reference to
any thing but is considered as composed of
individuals only

suit from repeatedly abstracting the differences sveawhich are perceived to exist in the same indi

in which they agree thus corporeal animate
sensitive etc are said to be cognate to man
and inanimate insensitive etc cognate to stones
there is no actual difference between subal subaltern

i
i r
genera and
tern genus and subaltern species the differ √¢peciei
ence is only relative the former may be pre
dicated of a cognate species and the latter
may be the subject of a cognate genus they
are those intermediate genera and species
which are supposed to exist between summum
genus and any infima species each of them
may be regarded as a genus with reference to
all the species below it and as a species when
referred to the genera above it
the following table may serve to represent
at one view what has before been said re
specting genus and species with their sub
divisions 



on the species

summum genus is that which can never be
regarded as a species 
infima species can never be regarded as a
genus 
subaltern genus may be considered as a
subaltern species
subaltern species may be considered as a
subaltern genus
two kinds of there are two kinds of difference viz gedifference 


 
neric and specific
generic

generic differencei is that which constitutes
subaltern species it is termed generic because
that species which it constitutes may be consi
dered as a subaltern genus and consequently
the generic difference can be affirmatively pre
dicated of every species which is comprehended
under it hence it is predicated of things which
i the difference and specific property are often difficult to
 distinguish from each other but it should be remembered that
a property is only joined to an essence and results therefore
from the difference whereas the difference is a constituting part
of the essence if then a part of any essence be supposed to be
taken away that essence can no longer remain as it was the
 following test therefore which we may apply in order to find
the difference will i believe in most cases succeed since the
genus and difference united form the species it follows that if
the difference be supposed to be taken away from any species
that species must revert to its subaltern genus in fact the
species will not any longer exist but if a property be supposed
to be taken from it the essence i e the species will not thereby
be injured this test however is by no means unerring but is
frequently applicable thus a proposition is said to be a
sentence which asserts hence any sentence which does not
assert i e affirm or deny is not a proposition

of predicables



differ from each other in species e g sensitive
is a generic difference to man and it may be
predicated of all animals as well as of man
specific difference is that which constitutes specific
infima species and it is this kind which is
generally meant by the logical difference it
can be predicated of all the individuals con
tained under the species which it constitutes
and is therefore said to be predicated of things
which differ in number i e numerically thus
rational which is the specific difference of man
is predicable of every man but not of any other
animal
property is divided into two kinds viz property of

property is two
generic

that which is necessarily joined to or accom
panies the essence of the summum or subal
tern genus specific property is that which specific
flows of results from the essence of the infima
species and is predicated of one species and
m generic properties may be predicated of many more indi
viduals than specific properties for the latter can be predicated
only of the different individuals contained under one species but
generic properties may be predicated of different species and
consequently of all the individuals contained under those species
thus the property in triangles that the three angles are equal
together to two right angles is a generic property and may be
predicated of all triangles but the property that all equilateral
triangles are also equiangular is a specific property and can
not be predicated of all triangles but only of that species which
is termed equilateral

perty has also been divided into four kinds

case for some men are not grammarians the

termed a property even admitting its existence
twokindjof
accident is also divided into two kinds
accident 
viz inseparable and separable
√¢∞ accidents says mr bentham p that is acci
dental properties are next divided into separable and insepar
able again speaking of dr whatelys examples viz a

of predicables



the inseparable accidents are such as can inseparable 
not be separated from the individual of whom
man walking and a man native of paris mr bentham ob
serves i cannot discover any difference in the respective
separability of the properties in question he then asks this
question what does the property of a man toulking mean v
he answers thus that the man of whom it is affirmed was
√¢ñ†walking at such a time in such a place and this or any
other may be the answer for the question in itself implies an
absurdity and therefore cannot admit of any true answer the
property of a man walking is downright nonsense and wholly
unintelligible mr bentham may well ask what it means
it would have saved his readers much trouble if he would have
defined property as he uses the word which i cannot perceive
that he has done for to the mind of a logician who by
property means pradicabile quod prtedicatur de pluribus specie
vel numero differentibus in quale ut essentiajunctum necessario 
the term accidental property conveys a contradiction of ideas 
for how can any thing be necessarily joined to an essence by
accident but the whole of this passage is so amusing that
it is well worth transcribing he observes alluding to dr
whatelys examples given above i cannot discover any dif
ference in the respective separability of the properties in question
what does the property of a man walking mean √¢Äîthat the
man of whom it is affirmed was walking at such a time in
such a place√¢Äîand that of a mans being a native of a place √¢Äî
that he was born at such a time in such a place√¢Äîthe man is
no longer walking in that place√¢Äîtrue but he is no longer being
born either√¢Äîyou cannot however take away from him his pro
perty of having been born√¢Äîno nor can you take away that of
his having been walking where then is the distinction between
the separable property of having been walking and the insepar
able property of having been born v the sophistry of such an
argument is palpable for mr bentham has confounded the
fact of a mans walking with that of his having been walk
ing he sets out with saying that he cannot discover the
difference in the separability of such accidents or as he terms
them such accidental properties as a man walking and
e



on the species of predicables

they are predicated thus if i predicate of a
man that he took a walk yesterday his
having taken a walk would be what is termed
an inseparable accident for though now it
cannot be separated from his essence yet it
was only contingently joined to it and not
necessarily
separable

the separable accident is such as can be

separated from the individual e g if i pre
dicate of a man that he is standing this is a
separable accident for he may sit down
 a man native of paris and this he endeavours to show by
the train of reasoning transcribed above the conclusion at which
he arrives is that he cannot discover the difference between the
separable property of having beenwalking instead of walking
and the inseparable property of having been born and it would
truly have been a circumstance not a little astonishing had he
been able to discover the difference for the fact of a mans
having been walking is an accident as inseparable as that of his
having been born of such sophisms as the above aldrich ob
serves p qui hoc vel hujus simile attulerit ut innumera afferri solent docendus est congrue loqui this fallacy
may be classed under what mr bentham terms fallacy by
artful evasion p which answers to dr whatelys fal
lacy of irrelevant conclusion commonly called ignoratio
elenchi vide dr whately elements of logic p 
a separable accident is that which can actually be separated
from the individual thus for a man to be walking must be a
separable accident for he may sit down but the fact of his
having been walking is an inseparable accident and such an
accident differs from a property in this respect that it was when
it happened a contingency i e it was possible that it might not
have happened as it did but a property never is a contingency
but results from the essence necessarily and as it were natural in



on division



it should be remembered that an inseparable
accident is predicable only of individuals for
all accidents must be separable from the species
or they would be properties

section vii
division is the distinct enumeration of divi√¢ion
the several things signified by a common noun
for as in logic a singular noun is called in
divisible so a common noun is called divisible
because it admits of logical division
there are two kinds of division i e logical of two kinds
and physical and although they are perfectly
distinct in their nature from each other yet
logical division is analogous to physical
physical division n is the division of an indi physical
division
√¢∞ the word division literally signifies the separation of
the component parts of any thing in which case each part is
absolutely less than the whole divided but since in logical
division the dividing parts are each in comprehension greater
than the whole divided hence the word division as thus
used is obviously applied in a figurative or secondary sense
p physical division is the division of individuals i e of ob
jects which have real existence logical division is the division
of ideas but since an idea itself has not any real existence
logical division is used upon those words which are the signs of
ideas and common nouns as has been shown above sec are
representatives of ideas and as such will be the only nouns
upon which logical division can operate any singular noun may

vidual into its component parts thus a book
might be divided into its leaves cover back
etc and it is by this division that any indi
vidual object might be divided each of the
dividing parts in such division is therefore
absolutely less than the whole divided
logical division is the division of common
nouns and the whole divided can be predi
cated of each of its dividing parts thus
 book might be logically divided into folios
quartos octavos etc and it might be pre
dicated of all folios that they were books
and of all quartos that they were books etc
hence it is manifest that if the whole divided
be a genus the dividing members must be the
species comprehended under it and if the
whole divided be a species the dividing mem
bers must be the individuals containedunder
that species
be physically divided because it represents and stands for one
individual object which may be divided into its component parts
i there are frequently various modes of dividing a common
noun thus animals might be divided into rutin ml and irra
tional into coldblooded and warmblooded into winged and notwinged or men beasts birds fishes insects etc and this is
the case with all other nouns and of all these different modes
of division one is not more right than another for they all are
logical divisions though one may be more suitable to our pre
sent purpose than another hence we must remember what is our
endinview and adopt that mode of division which may seem
most adapted to it

i

on division



there are three rules for good logical di rules for
division
vision
 let each of the dividing parts or any of
them contain less i e have a more limited
signification than the whole divided r
the words minus contineant s mean that each the divide
parts imply
of the dividing members must be less extensive te wholethan the whole divided for in logical divi
sion each of the dividing parts or members is
always more comprehensive i e has a more
extensive signification than the divided whole 
and each of them may thus be considered as

r thus if the word hound were divided into greyhound dog
bloodhound etc such a division would err against the first rule
for the word dog would be more extensive than the whole divided
or hound so if unimal were divided into quadruped and biped
this division would err against the second rule for the union of
these two parts would not be so extensive as animal the whole
divided for there are many animals which are neither quad
rupeds nor bipeds
 a perfect division may be formed by means of the definite
and indefinite nouns e g men may be divided into those who are
europeans and those who are not europeans animals into ra
tional and irrational bipeds or not bipeds such dichotomy
thus produced by what is called contradictory bifurcation con
stitutes a perfect division for the union of such two parts will
obviously be equivalent to the whole divided if the parts of a
divided whole be many in number such a division may possibly
be as complete and perfect as if it were a dichotomy but it
cannot easily be shown to be so unless the contradictory bifur
cate division be applied to it an instance of this case will be
given in the next section

on division

more than the whole inasmuch as they each
imply the whole u for every one of the dividing
parts may be regarded as a species with re
ference to the whole divided as a genus thus
each of them is a metaphysical whole when
compared with the divided noun which will
be a logical whole to all its dividing parts
 let all the parts collectively be exactly
equal to the whole divided
 let the divided parts be distinct or op
posed to each other i e let not one part be
contained under another e g if we were to
divide tree into forest tree oak elm plum tree
fruit tree such parts would be contained in
each other for a forest tree may be an oak or
an elm and an elm or an oak is a forest tree
√¢Ñ¢ thus if we were to divide rectilineal figure we should di
vide it into triangle square circle etc and each of these parts
would comprehend more than the whole for a triangle is not
only a rectilinealfigure but it is a threesided rectilineal figure
the term triangle therefore represents a more complex idea
than the term rectilinealfigure so the terms square circle etc
are each more comprehensive than the term rectilineal figure
because they each imply that term thus also if the whole
divided were a species and its dividing parts were individuals
each of these parts would be a more comprehensive term than
the whole for every singular term which represents an indi
vidual is a more full and complete term than the species which
contains it and since the species may be predicated of each of
the individuals under it consequently each of these individuals
implies the species and is therefore a more comprehensive term

on definition



section viii
definition as used in logic is an explana definition
tori sentence i e a sentence which explains
any term so as to separate the idea represented
by that term from any other idea whatsoever
a word may be unintelligible to a hearer it√¢ object
either from his not at all understanding its
meaning or from its conveying to his mind an
idea different to that which was intended the
object of definition therefore is either to con
vey to the hearers mind the idea which the
defined term is intended to represent or else
to correct any indistinct notion which may er
roneously have been assigned to ity
x definition literally signifies the laying down the boun
dary of any thing but it is here used to signify a sentence
which so explains a term as to separate that term from any
other and thus to lay down as it were the boundary or limit
of its signification since therefore it is here used in a pecu
liar and metaphorical sense it must be a word of the second
intention
√¢ words being the signs of ideas it is manifest that a word
may frequently convey an idea either wholly different from
that intended or else indistinct in such cases the use of defi
nition is apparent for it not only conveys the idea intended but
serves to give the hearer a more distinct knowledge of the term
defined by explaining what was before not clearly known to
him hence it is essential to a good definition that it be ex
planatory



on definition

definitions are divided into two classes viz
nominal and real
nominal
the nominal definition explains only the sig
definition
nification of the term such definitions are
used when the term which has been uttered
does not convey any idea to the hearers mind
viz when he does not understand the meaning
of the term which is therefore explained by
making use of some equivalent expression
which may be more intelligible thus you
might define emblem that which is a sign of
any thing or essence as universal nature or
approximation as a near approach
real
the real definition is that which declares
definition
or explains the nature of the term which pro
fesses to explain not only the meaning of the
term but the nature also of the thing signiof two kinds fied of real definitions there are two species
viz the accidental and the essential
accidental
the accidental definition is that which de
definition
fines a term by describing or enumerating some
of its properties or accidents such definitions
are also termed descriptions arid are more
classes of
definition

 in many cases the nominal and real essence of any thing
exactly coincide viz the idea conveyed by the word is exactly
the same as the nature of the thing e g in mathematics and
many other sciences see dr whately on this subject p 
 thus a triangle that which has three angles and
a rightangled triangle that which has one right angle are
each both nominal and real definitions

on definition



commonly to be met with than any others
for as we are frequently unable to ascertain
the natural or component parts of any thing
and more especially the metaphysical parts
i e the genus and difference description is
often the only method by which we are able
to define a term
the essential definition is that which lays essential
 definition
down the constituting parts of the essence and
it is of two kinds viz the metaphysical or of two kinds
logical and the physical
the metaphysical definition is that which metaphysical
 
definition
lays down the ideal parts of an essence viz
the genus and differentia hence it is obvious
that any term which will admit of being meta
physically defined must be a species no in
dividual therefore can be logically defined
 an individual cannot be defined but by description i e by
enumerating the accidents belonging to such individual whereby
the differences existing between that and any other may be
shown this kind of definition mr bentham terms individua
tion but observes that as time and place are constantly
varying exposition by individuation alone can never enable the
learner to recognize the individual whose name is thus ex
pounded√¢Äî p the examples which he gives of indivi
duation are john is the man who is sitting in that chair
 louis xviii is the man who was king of france at the time
you were at paris√¢Äîi do not understand what mr bentham
means when he says that by such definitions the learner
would not be able to recognise these individuals surely in
these examples both time and place are exhibited and of these
he says no other properties nor yet one of these without the

on definition

neither can summum genus for it is the highest
of all genera and cannot therefore be defined
by assigning its genus and difference inas
much as it has not any superior genus de
scription is the only mode of defining it i e
by an enumeration of its properties
the physical definition is that which lays



n 

down the real parts the essence i e those
parts which admit of actual separation thus
other can ever distinguish an individual from all others which
may exist or can be conceived to exist now when he as
serts that no other properties but those characteristic ones of
time and place can distinguish an individual he must imply
that these properties when exhibited will distinguish an indi
vidual and if this be his meaning he contradicts himself when
he says that individuation alone will not enable us to recognize
an individual however this may be if a learner were to ask
who john was and was to receive for answer john is
the man who is sitting in that chair if i say this learner
should not be able by means of such a definition to recognise
that john from any other individual whatsoever the circum
stance would probably result not so much from the deficiency of
the definition as of the learners intellectual faculties in fact
to use language very similar to mr benthams elegant ex
pression p he would be a fool for by the sentence
 john is the man who is sitting in that chair it is evident
that the very individual john is visible and therefore may be
seen by the learner unless indeed the learner happen to be
blind in which case the definition would not be defective but
the circumstance would result from the deficiency of the learners
sight what is meant by the characteristic properties of time
and place i am at a loss to imagine but mr bentham seems
to imply that the fact of an individuals sitting in a chair at
some particular time is a characteristic property of that indivi
dual which is curious enough

√¢Ä¢√¢Ä¢

horse might be physically defined as being an
animal composed of head body mane legs
etc and a book as being composed of cover

there are three rules for good definition
rules iw
definition
 let the definition be adequate to the
term defined i e the idea conveyed by the
definition must be exactly equal to that which
is meant to be conveyed by the definitum or
term defined consequently its signification
must not be too extensive nor too confined thus if a tree were defined to be a plant
having leaves such a definition would be too
extensive for many plants have leaves which
are not trees in this case the definition ex
plains a whole when the term defined is but a
part again if a tree were defined to be
 a plant which bears fruit such a definition
would be too limited for there are many trees
which do not bear fruit and in this case the
definition would have explained only a part
when the term defined is a whole
b the following table presents at one view the different
kinds of definition according to aldrichs logic 
c nominal

t physical
the four infimse species of definition are nominal accidental
f

i



on definition

 let the definition be in itself clearer
and more plain than the term defined i e
the definition must convey an idea which will
be clearer and better known to the generality
of persons to whom it is addressed than the
idea which is conveyed by the term defined 
the words per sed are opposed to per accidens because the term defined may by ac
cident be better understood than the words of
the definition

metaphysical and physical this division of definitions is an
example of dichotomy see the last section
c it has been frequently objected to metaphysical definition
that it is not clearer in most cases than the term defined and
when the term which is to be defined is very familiar to the
hearer this certainly is the fact thus the word man is more
familiar to the ear and is accidentally better known than the
term rational animal but yet the words rational animal are in
their nature more clear and better known than the word man
inasmuch as they convey less complicated ideas and all words
which express less complicated ideas are in their nature clearer
than those which convey more complex ideas all definitions
of ideas purely simple must of necessity be at best not clearer
than the terms defined e g the definition of colour which
could hardly be defined so that the definition should be better
known than the term itself
see aldrich chap i √¢ß 
 thus if a triangle were defined to be a figure which has its
three interior angles together equal to two right angles such a
definition would not be so clear as the word triangle and would
err against the second rule so old age is the evening of life 
 a warrior is the thunderbolt of war would err against the
third rule for the words which compose these definitions are
metaphorical again if we were to define a cascade by saying
that it was a waterfall such a definition would be too short

on definition



 let the definition be included in a just
number ofproper words √¢Ä¢ i e the words em
ployed must not be used in a metaphorical
sense as such words would probably produce
indistinctness so also the number of the words
must be suitable for too much brevity would
produce obscurity and too great prolixity con
fusion f

care therefore must be taken that all definitions be exactly
equivalent or adequate to the terms defined and that they be in
all respects more clear and intelligible for since the difference
or essence of a definition is that it be explanatory it would cease
to be a good definition if it did not render clear and intelli
gible those terms which before were not so
f mr bentham in treating of definition or as he terms it
exposition has increased the species from four to twelve the
merits of which need not now be discussed with respect how
ever to that mode of expositionwhich he has termed in
dividual description he has apparently fallen into error he
defines individual description to be description applied to
individuals viz a detailed exposition of the accidental pro
perties of an individual this is as he observes the only
mode that can serve for the physical recognition of an indivi
dual portraits he says are examples of individual de
scription but can a portrait be said to be a detailed exposi
tion of the accidental properties of an individual putting aside
the absurdity of calling a portrait an example of any kind of
definition but admitting all this let us grant that a portrait is
one of the only ways by which an individual can be physically
recognized and i appeal to common sense and ask whether an
individual might not be as well if not better recognized by
being personally seen as by a view of his portrait the answer
must surely be in the affirmative and yet mr bentham has
implied in one of his examples of individuation which i have
spoken of in a former note that the reverse is the fact for in
the instance alluded to john is the man who is sitting in that

f

on definition

chair it is selfevident that such an expression would not be
used unless that individual could at tliat time be personally seen
and vet mr bentham says that in such a case this individual
john could not be physically recognized whereas by a sight of
his portrait he might this is strange it must be confessed
the chief merit of this chapter on exposition seems to consist in
a display of what is there termed onomatopoea a faculty
which mr bentham appears to possess in a high degree for it
will be found on the perusal of his work that he has enriched
his native tongue with a considerable number of new words
such as discoursual non discoursual archetypation individual
tion anoopneumatology etc which however closely they mav
adhere to the poets injunction of being grasco fonte parce
detorta will probably produce no inconsiderable distortions in
the countenances of those who have the misfortune to be forced
to pronounce them

on propositions

the second part of logic treats ofproposition of proposi
tion

are expressive of the second operation of the
mind or judgement
a proposition
is defined to be oratio in debned
proposition
r r
dicativa congrua et perfecta verum velfalsum
significans sine ambiguitate this definition
is of a compound nature for it is partly meta
physical and partly accidental a proposition
would be more accurately defined to be oratio
indicativa ie an asserting sentence this
definition would comprehend the whole essence
of proposition for a sentence is its genus
and asserting i e affirming or denying its
difference the other parts of the former de aldrieh chap ii √¢ß 
h a proposition being a sentence which asserts viz which
affirms or denies it follows that all exclamations interroga
tions commands etc are excluded and are not regarded as
propositions thus do ye now believe v how amiable

but truth lies in the bottom of a well tempus fugit

on propositions

finition are properties etc of proposition and
ought not strictly to form a part of the defini
tion but to be deduced from it
ituisitmr
there are four requisites for constituting a
plosion legitimate proposition
 that as far as regards the words it must
be a sentence which affirms or denies c √¢Ä¢ which
is its whole essence
 that as to sense it must signify some
thing true or false i e it must declare that
which is the real fact or that which is not the
fact and this is the property of a proposition
c judgement was defined part i √¢ß to be the decision
upon the mutual agreement or disagreement of any two objects
when compared with each other and the sentence which
declares this decision and expresses judgement is called a pro
position now the agreement or disagreement of any two ob
jects cannot be expressed in words except by affirmation or ne
gation viz by some assertion consequently it is necessary in
order to constitute a proposition that it must be a sentence which
affirms or denies therefore its affirming or denying distinguishes
it from any other kind of sentence and is its difference
a judgement is liable to the error of falsity as has been
shown before part i √¢ß for a decision may manifestly be
false inasmuch as it may have been decided that two particular
objects agree when they do not or vice versa and in such a
case the decision or judgement would be false hence a propo
sition which expresses such a decision must of necessity assert
that which is not really the fact i e it must signify that which
is false and since all propositions must either assert what is the
fact or what is not consequently they must all signify some
thing either true or false and this is called a specific property
of propositions since it seems to result immediately from their
difference i e from their affirming or denying

section ii
propositions are divided according to their division of
propositions
substance their quality and their quantity
the substance of a proposition is its genus substance
e aldrich chap ii √¢ß 
f these two last rules are selfevident for if a proposition
were ambiguous viz admitted of being construed in more ways
than one it would be a sort of double sentence and this ambi
guity may be produced by equivocal words or by a dubious
form of expression e g that is a bull croesus halyn
penetrans magnam pervertit opum vim both these sentences
are ambiguous and may each be considered in more than one
way consequently they may each be regarded as more than
one sentence on this point see whatelys elements ch iii
√¢ß p again if a proposition were ungrammatical or
mutilated such a sentence might be unintelligible and would
not therefore be a legitimate proposition this may frequently
be observed to be the case in proverbs and such sort of sen
tences where although the ellipsis is not such as to render the
meaning unintelligible yet it cannot strictly be termed an ac
curate proposition for it might produce ambiguity
b should not the substance of a proposition be said to be its

or material part of its essence i e its being

their substance are considered as of two kinds

absolutely e unconditionally e g be
nevolence is not the whole of virtue no
hypothetical man can live for ever the hypothetical is
that which asserts under some condition or
whole essence and not the genus for every assertion can be ex
pressed either absolutely or conditionally hence by regarding
the substance of propositions we divide them into categorical
and hypothetical the former of which asserts absolutely and the
latter asserts under some hypothesis or condition the substance
of a proposition is commonly said to be its genus or the material
part of its essence viz that it is a sentence but if this were
the case commands and questions might also be considered as
propositions which is not the fact aldrich says chap ii √¢ß 
that to the question quit est proposition the answer must be
categorica vel hypothetica and this is not answering by consi
dering the genus but the different species of propositions and
aldrich declares haec divisio peti dicitur a substantia propositionis the substance therefore of a proposition is the character
of its assertion ie whether the assertion be expressed abso
lutely or not absolutely viz conditionally which are the only
ways in which any assertion can be expressed and in dividing
propositions in this manner we must regard their whole essence
and not only the genus or material part of their essence for
sentences may be expressed in various ways besides absolutely
and conditionally for instance commands and questions are sen
tences but are not propositions dr whately p considers
the substance as the genus or material part of the essence of pro
positions and i consequently feel much diffidence in expressing
an opinion which is at variance with an author who has treated
the science of logic with such ability

the categorical proposition is divided into dwuion m
categorical
two kinds viz the pure categorical and the
modal
the pure categorical proposition is that purr
which asserts simply whether the subject does
or does not agree with the predicate as nescit voxmissa reverti george the fourth is

the modal categorical h expresses in what m√¢iai

either considering the word which expresses the mode as united

quality

another division of propositions is by re

garding their quality and of quality there may
or two kinds be two sorts viz the quality of the expression
essential and
accidental or fog essential quality which is the differentia
and the quality of the matter or the accidental
quality which is consequently the property
propositions are divided according to their
essential quality into affirmative and negative
 the definitions which aldrich has given of an affirmative
proposition viz that which has an affirmative copula and
of a negative viz that which hits a negative copula are
accidental for the having an affirmative or negative copula
is not the differentia but a property of such propositions meta
physically they may be defined thus affirmative propositions
assert the agreement of their extremes and negatives the dis
agreement the copula serves to indicate this connexion care
must be taken not to be deceived by the copula for a proposi
tion may have a negative in it without being a negative propo
sition e g he who is not wicked deserves our love which
is an affirmative proposition the method of detecting this will
be to consider the meaning of the propositions and what asser
tion is made relative to the extremes if the proposition asserts
that its extremes agree it is affirmative for agreement must be

of propositions



an affirmative proposition is that which as affirmative
serts that its extremes agree with each other proposjn
i e that the predicate may be asserted of the
subject as oxford is a city containing an
university an englishman will fight in de
fence of his country
a negative proposition is that which asserts native
that its extremes disagree i e that the pre propouoi√¢Ä¢
dicate cannot be asserted of the subject as
no christian fears the hour of death
 nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit
propositions are also divided according to
their accidental quality or quality of the mat
ter into true and fake and this is said to be
the property inasmuch as it results from the
essence of the proposition i e from the dif
ference or assertion which must of necessity be
either true orfalse
expressed by affirmation but if it asserts that the extremes
√¢√¢Ä¢ it is negative for negation alone expresses disagree
ment
the necessary consequence which results from any asserh√¢∞n is that it must be either true or false which is the acci
dental quality or qualitas rei as it is commonly termed to
ascertain the truth or falsehood of any proposition is not the
office of logic but it must be proved by a consideration of that
science or art to which the subject matter of the proposition begs consequently as will be shown hereafter the truth or
sehood √¢∞f every proposition will depend upon its matter viz
he connexion which naturally exists between its extremes
√¢ñ†b when we speak of the quality of a proposition without
eclating which kind the essential quality or qualitas vocis is
meant viz its being affirmative or negative

on the species

a true proposition is that which asserts what
is the real fact as the object of logic is to
direct the mind in the acquisition of know
ledge england is an island
a false proposition is that which asserts
what is not the fact as logic is the art of
using the reason a murderer is not de
serving of punishment
propositions may also be divided by regard
ing their quantity into universal particular
singular and indefinite
the quantity of a proposition means the
extent to which the predicate is asserted of
the subject
an universal proposition is when the predi
cate is asserted of the whole of the subject 
and since the subject is in this case taken in
its whole sense i e for every thing signified
by it it is said to be distributed and this
distribution is indicated by some sign of uni
versality as all none every one etc
e g all bad passions are to be avoided 
 no virtuous act will lose its reward
 a term is said to be distributed when it is taken in its fullest
extent i e when it is intended to comprehend every thing to
which it is applicable thus all misers are discontented j
the word miser is here distributed for it is intended to com
prehend every miser and the proposition is equivalent to there
is not one miser who is not discontented but in the proposition
 some men are avaricious the word men is not distributed
because it is not intended to apply to every man for there may
be many men who are not avaricious

of propositions



a particular proposition is that whose pre particular
propositions
dicate is asserted of only apart of the subject
and since in this case the subject is not taken
for every thing signified by it hence it is not
distributed and this is indicated by a sign of
particularity prefixed to it as some few
 many etc e g some men are possessed
of more judgement than others not every
one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter
into the kingdom of heaven
a singular proposition is that whose subject singular

propositions
is a singular noun or a common noun with a
singular sign see part i √¢ß e g dionysius was a tyrant that man is a thief
but since in all cases of singular propositions
the predicate is asserted of the whole of the
subject hence the subject is distributed and
singular propositions are see the next section
considered as universals
with respect to indefinite propositionsn they indefinite
propositions

 any proposition except a singular to whose subject there is
not affixed some sign denoting whether that common noun is to
be taken for every thing signified by it or not must be regarded
as indefinite because the extent in which that subject is taken
is not limited hut in order to ascertain this extent we must
apply to our common sense and also to a knowledge of that
particular science or art to which the proposition relates in
other words we must look to the matter and by that we must
be guided but indefinites need not be classed as a distinct spe
cies of propositions because they must be either universals or
particulars since the predicate must be said either of the whott
or only of a part of the subject
g



on the species of propositions

are such as have common terms for their sub
jects but they have not any sign either of
universality or particularity whereby we may
know whether the subject is to be taken in its
fullest sense or not but inasmuch as it is evi
dent that the predicate must be asserted either
universally or partially of the subject it is ob
vious that all indefinite propositions may be
classed under universals or particulars accord
ing as their predicate is said of the whole or
only a part of the subject and this must be
ascertained from the natural connexion existing
between the subject and the predicate which
is called the matter of the proposition and
which will be explained in the next section
it is useless therefore to consider indefinites as
a separate class of propositions thus it ap
pears that strictly speaking propositions di
vided by considering their quantity are of two
kinds viz universal and particular
in order to keep this in mind the following
line was formed

section iii
in every singular proposition the predicate
is said of the whole of the subject i e the
subject is taken for every thing signified by it
or is distributed e g dionysius was a ty
rant here the whole of dionysius is meant 
consequently in a syllogism singular propo

matter

the matter of a proposition is the extent
of connexion which naturally exists between
the extremes and it is of three kinds ne
cessary impossible and contingent

accessary

necessary matter is when the extremes of a
proposition essentially and invariably agree
with each other as all islands are sur
rounded by water
 the quantity of propositions as far as regards the words is
fourfold viz universal particular singular and indefinite but
as far as it affects syllogistic argument and consequently re
gards the judgement which is expressed by it it may be con
sidered as of two kinds only viz universal and particular for
the singular as has been shown is equivalent to the universal
and the indefinite must be either universal or particular ac
cording to the connexion which exists between its extremes
and which is termed the matter of a proposition the word
matter is an equivocal word for it may signify either the com
ponent parts of a proposition i e the subject predicate and
copula or the agreement or disagreement naturally subsisting be
tween the subject and predicate in which last sense it is here used

of terms



impossible matter is when the extremes of impossible
a proposition differ from each other essentially
and invariably as no human institution is
wholly without error
contingent matter is when the extremes of a contingent
proposition partly agree with each other and
partly differ as some human inventions are
beneficial to mankind
the quantity of indefinite propositions may indefinites
be determined by these different kinds of mat
ter for in necessary and impossible matter an
indefinite may be considered as an universal
and the sign of universality may be prefixed 
e g human inventions are liable to error 
in which case we may say all human inven
tions etc and honourable men are not
willing to disgrace their characters that is
 no honourable men etc but in contingent
matter i e when the extremes only partially
agree an indefinite proposition must be con
sidered as a particular e g victories have

since in every universal proposition the pre
dicate is said of the whole of the subject hence
the subject is distributed in every universal q
serve for syllogistic reasoning with respect to substance we
shall consider only one class viz pure categoricals and by
regarding the quality viz the essential quality and the quan
tity it has been shown that there are two classes of each i e
affirmative and negative universal and particular hence it is
manifest that there cannot be more than these four classes 
universal affirmative universal negative particular affirmative
and particular negative
i with respect to the subject of an universal proposition being
distributed it is selfevident that this is the case it being the
differentia of an universal proposition the fact is equally clear
with respect to the distribution of the predicate in the universal
negative but in the particular negative it is not so manifest
that this is the case it may however be proved thus some
men are not logicians this proposition asserts that there is a
certain class of men no one of which is a logician viz there is
some limited number of individuals comprised in the subject
from which every individual comprehended under the predicate is

of terms



but in negative propositions the predicate
must be distributed or the proposition could
not be true thus no human institution is
perfect would be false if anypart even of the
term perfect agreed with the term human
institution the distribution therefore of
the terms of propositions depends upon their
universality and their negation hence this
rule may be formed
 all universals distribute the subject and general mie
all negatives distribute the predicate
it sometimes happens that the predicate of predicate of




affirmative
an affirmative
is
distributed r but
since
this an
som√¢ime
distributed

wholly excluded or in other words the term logician in its most
extensive signification cannot be predicated of any individual
comprised under that class of men which is the subject conse
quently it is evident that the term logician is here used in its
most universal sense viz it is distributed and unless it were
so distributed the proposition some men are not logicians
would not be true
r the predicate of an affirmative proposition cannot with ac
curacy be ever said to be distributed for although it may acci
dentally happen that the predicate be of equal extent with the
subject i e that the predicate in its fullest sense may be affirmed
of the subject also distributed yet this fact is by no means im
plied in the form of expression of the affirmative proposition the
predicate therefore is not actually distributed whately
p but is distributable and the point to be considered is
not what might be said with truth but what actually lias been said
a case somewhat similar to the present occurs in the reduc
tion of one of the modes of syllogisms in part iii which will
be shown hereafter it often happens that the predicate is
of equal extent with the subject of an affirmative proposition



on the opposition

circumstance does not depend upon the form
of the expression but is merely accidental re
sulting as aldrich observes chap ii √¢ß virtute significati non virtute signi it is not to
be considered so as to affect any argument nor
could any inference be drawn which depended
on such a circumstance for the form of the
expression alone is regarded in logic the truth
or falsehood of a proposition depending upon
its subject matter

section iv
opposition

two propositions are said to be opposed to
each other when the subject and predicate
being the same in each they differ from each
other either in quantity or in quality or in
both and since there are four different classes

and is therefore distributable as is the case in most mathematical
definitions e g a rectilineal triangle is a plane figure con
tained by three straight lines also in all metaphysical defi
nitions as a proposition is an asserting sentence or where
the predicate is any specific property of the subject as a pro
position is a sentence signifying something true or false if
then any conclusion be deduced from such a case as this such
a conclusion may materially be correct but it must be inaccurate
according to the rules of logic because it could not be deduced
from the form of the expression alone

of propositions



of propositions which may be formed each
having the same subject and predicate viz
a e i and o any two of which are said to
be opposed consequently there are four dif
ferent kinds of opposition i e contrary subeontrary subaltern and contradictory
contrary opposition is between two uni contrary
versal propositions differing from each other
in quality only viz between a and e e g
 all men are mortal no men are mortal
subcontrary opposition is between two par subcomraiy

 propositions when opposed to each other are said to have
the same subject and predicate and the points in which they
are to differ is in quality or in quantity or in both but it must
be remembered that when any propositions oppose each other
they are not only to have the same subject and predicate but
those terms are to be used with reference to each other in exactly
the same sense in both the propositions or no opposition can sub
sist between them this rule which aldrich has stated as ap
plying to contradictories alone see chap ii sec is equally
applicable to all the other species of opposition and if this
were not observed the four kinds of propositions might be all
true or all false together
 the opposition which exists between two singular proposi
tions can only be contrary opposition for the quantity of sin
gulars cannot be changed except by conversion but since
the matter of a singular proposition cannot be contingent hence
the contrary to a singular forms as perfect an opposition as con
tradiction for if a singular be true its contrary must of ne
cessity be false and vice versa for it will be shown in this
section that contraries cannot be both true or both false to
gether either in necessary or impossible matter

n b in order that two propositions should
be contradictories and such cannot be both
true nor both false together care must be
taken that the terms of both the propositions
are to be used in exactly the same sense u with
respect to each other
 aldrich has given this rule in the following words notandum est ad contradictionem requiri quatuor nempe loqui

of propositions



of all these four kinds of opposition the which kind
j
f
n
√¢∞f opposition
contradictory is the most perfect for contra mostcomdictories differ from each other in all points
viz not only in quality the one heing nega
tive and the other affirmative but in quantity
also for the one is universal and the other
particular therefore it is manifest that when
any proposition is true its contradictory must
of necessity he false and conversely if any
proposition be false the contradictory to it
must be true
since in every proposition the assertion is truth and


i√¢ii
falsehood derespectmg the relation which the extremes pend up√¢∞n

the matter
bear to each other it is obvious that the truth
or falsehood of that assertion must depend

de eodem eodem modo secundum idem ad idem
 in eodem tempore vide chap ii √¢ß all of these re
quisites may be comprehended in this one general rule viz
that the subject and predicate of the opposing propositions must
be employed in exactly the same sense with respect to each other 
and this rule applies as has been shown above to all the cases
of opposition as well as to the particular one of contradic
tion contradictories are perfectly opposed to each other e g
 all men are logicians some men are not logicians what
the one proposition affirms universally the other denies par
tially again no men are dogs some men are dogs in
this case one of these propositions asserts the terms dogs and
men to disagree universally and the other asserts the partial
agreement of these very same terms employed in exactly the
same sense with regard to each other if therefore any one of
these propositions be true its contradictory must be false and if
false its contradictory must be true



on the opposition

upon the relation which naturally does exist
between those extremes viz upon the matter
the relation which is expressed in a propo
sition between its extremes is that of their
agreement or disagreement with each other
the rule therefore which may be formed with
respect to the truth or falsehood of proposi
tions in the different kinds of matter is as fol
lows whenever the assertion of a proposition
respecting the mutual agreement or disagree
ment of its extremes coincides with what is
knownx by the matter respecting their real
connexion then the proposition is a true one
and vice versa thus in necessary matter it is
known that the extremes invariably and essen
tially agree consequently all affirmatives which
assert the agreement of their extremes will be
true but negatives which assert that they
disagree are of course false the case is the
same with respect to all the different kinds of
matter hence the following rules will be selfevident 
 to discover the matter of any proposition cannot be effected
by logic but depends upon the science or system to which the
subject matter of the proposition belongs thus the planets
are not stationary the extremes of this proposition are asserted
to differ and this assertion will evidently be true if these ex
tremes really do differ this point however could not be disco
vered by logic but rather from a knowledge of astronomy to
which science the subject matter belongs

on the opposition

by an inspection of this scheme it will be
manifest that the contraries cannot be both
true together nor the subcontraries hoh false
with many other observations and if the matter
be known the truth or falsehood of any pro
position may be easily discovered
general rules n b if an universal be truey the par
ticular contained under it will also be true for
if the predicate may be asserted of the whole
 of the subject of course it may be asserted of
a part of it
 if a particular be false the universal
which contains it will be false also for if the
predicate cannot be asserted of a part of the
subject a fortiori it cannot be asserted of the
whole of it since the whole must contain that
part
if the universal be false z or the particular
j thus if it be true that all human institutions are liable to
imperfection it necessarily must be true that some human
institutions are liable to imperfection again if it be false
that some vicious habits are worthy of receiviag commenda
tion it will evidently be false to predicate of all vicious habits
that they are worthy of receiving commendation for as the pre
dicate cannot be said of a part of the subject of course it cannot
of the whole of it since the term some vicious habits is con
tained under all vicious habits
z let the universal be false e g all men are acquainted
with the science of astronomy although the predicate cannot
be asserted of the whole of the subject it does not therefore
follow that it may not be asserted of a part of it as some
men are acquainted with the science of astronomy in a simi

true the particular to the one and universal to
the other may be either true or false and un
less the matter be known it cannot be disco
vered which they are it would be useless to
go through all the various proofs which aldrich has given to show that a and e cannot
be true together but may be both false that
i and o may be both true but cannot be both
fake together etc for the conclusions are selfevident and by a knowledge of the rules above
given relative to the truth or falsehood of pro
positions in the different kinds of matter these
deductions will be manifest

section v
a proposition is said to be converted when conversion
its extremes are transposed
there are two kinds of conversion gene of two kinds
lar manner it may be shown that if the particular be true it
does not therefore necessarily follow that the universal must be
so for though the predicate may be asserted of a part of the
subject it does not necessarily follow that it may be asserted of
the whole of it the example just given will serve as an illustra
tion
 there is also another kind of conversion which is not men
tioned by aldrich but which is of use in logic this is called
conversion by contraposition dr whately calls it conversion
by negation it is effected by changing the quality of the propo
sition viz in the case of o you may conceive the negative as a
part of the predicate regarding the proposition as i instead of

h



on the conversion

rally used in logic viz simple conversion and
conversion per accidens
simple

simple conversion is the mere transposition
of the extremes of a proposition without any
change of the quantity or quality e g no
species of injustice is tolerable converted
thus nothing tolerable is a species of in thus though the terms are not strictly the same as before
yet the meaning of the proposition will not be altered e g
 some men are notlogicians here we may consider the pre
dicate as notlogicians instead of logicians and the pro
position will stand thus 
 some men are notlogicians 
viz some men are beings who are notlogicians
and this proposition being i may thus be simply converted 
 some beings who are notlogicians are men
by this mode a may be simply converted when reduced to the
form of e by introducing a double negative in the place of the
affirmation the meaning of the proposition will not of course
be altered by such a circumstance for says dr whately
 it is the same thing to affirm some attribute of the subject or
to deny the absence of that attribute p e g
 every act of prudence is an act of virtue
this is exactly equivalent to
 no act of prudence is not an act of virtue
this being e may consequently be simply converted therefore
 that which is not an act of virtue is not an act of prudence 
or no act but a virtuous one can be an act of prudence i e
a virtuous act alone can be an act of prudence
thus by some one of the three modes of conversion any propo
sition may be converted viz e i may be converted simply
e a per accidens and a o by contraposition
the following lines have been formed by logicians in order
√¢Ä¢to assist the mind in remembering these rules of conversion
f e c i simpliciter convertitur e v a per acci
f a x o per contra sic fit conversio tota

of propositions



justice some works of art are of human
invention converted to some things of hu
man invention are works of art
conversion per accidens or as dr whately per √¢√¢iden
more properly terms it conversion by limita
tion is when the extremes of the proposition
are transposed and the quantity is changed
alsob e g all quadrupeds are animals
converted to some animals are quadrupeds
 no tyrant deserves the love and esteem of
his subjects converted to some person who
deserves the love and esteem of his subjects is
not a tyrant
the truth of a proposition is not in any way
b accidental conversion depends upon the laws of subaltern
opposition in which it has before been shown that if the uni
versal be true the particular will also be so but if the universal
hefalse it does not necessarily follow that the particular must
be false hence it is obvious that if any universal be true its
accidental converse wil also be true but if false the accidental
converse may be true e g if it be true that no men are qua
drupeds it will also be true that some quadrupeds are not
men but if it be false that no men are liable to death it
is not necessarily false that some beings liable to death are
not men for this assertion is manifestly true hence it may
be seen that accidental conversion is not so complete an inference
as simple conversion for the simple converse of a proposition
always follows the accidental quality of the exposita viz if the
exposita be true or false its simple converse is the same pro
vided it be such a proposition as admits of being simply con
verted but the accidental converse of a proposition does not
follow the accidental quality of the exposita unless the exposita
be true

affected by logical conversion hence if a pro
position be true before conversion it must be
so after viz its converse must also be true for
 conversio utrobique illativa estc illative
conversion is when the truth of the converse
follows from that of the proposition which has
been converted or exposita as it is termed
and all conversion as used in logic must be
illative
hence we may deduce the following general
rule viz no term must be distributed after
conversion which was not distributed before it 
for in this case the term which was employed
only partially in the exposita has been used
universally in the converse and it has been
proved above see last section p that the
truth of an universal cannot be inferred from
that of its particular
from a consideration of this rule it will ap
pear that a and e may be converted per accidens and e and i simply and such conver
sion will be in all cases illative
the following memorial line was formed in
order to keep this circumstance in the students
remembrance 
f e c i simpliciter convertitur e v a per acci

viz e and i are simply converted e and a
c aldrich chap ii j 

of propositions



per accidens in order that a proposition may e and i conbe capable of being simply converted it is necessary that its extremes should be of equal
extent i e that either they should be both
distributed as is the case in the universal ne
gative or neither distributed as in the parti
cular affirmative d for let e be true e g
 no vice is commendable in this case both
of the extremes differ essentially from each
other this proposition therefore denotes that
vice differs from any commendable thing con
sequently any thing that is commendable must
differ from vice or no commendable thing
is vice again let i be true e g some
members of the university are good logicians
this proposition denotes the partial agreement
of the two extremes and since the terms good
logicians and members of the university agree
it follows that we can predicate of some good
logicians that they are members of the univer
sity viz some good logicians are members
of the university or else the original proposi
tion could not be true
d if any proposition in which one term only was distributed
were simply converted it is manifest that after conversion the
other term would be distributed and since by the hypothesis
this term could not have been distributed before such conver
sion cannot be illative hence it follows that unless under
some accidental circumstances neither a nor can be simply
converted
√¢Ä¢ aldrich proves the simple converse of i to be true in a dif


widens per

on the conversion
et e true tnen i its particular must

be true and consequently the simple converse
of i must be true but this is the accidental
converse of a therefore a may be converted
per accidens that e may also be converted
per accidens is selfevident for since the sim
ple converse of e is true the particular con
tained under this converse must be true also 
but this is the converse per accidens of the
original proposition e
o cannot be converted either simply or
ferent manner chap ii thus if i be true its contradic
tory e must be false therefore the simple converse of that
contradictory must also be false consequently the contradictory
to that simple converse must be true but this is the simple
converse of the original proposition i e g
i some members of the university are good logicians
true
e no members of the university are good logicians
false
e no good logicians are members of the university 
also false
therefore i some good logicians are members of the uni
versity must be true and this is the simple converse of the
original proposition some members of the university are good
logicians
 as it was remarked that in some affirmatives the whole
of the predicate does actually agree with the subject so when
this is the case and is granted to be so a may be illatively
converted simply but this is an accidental circumstance
elements of logic p 
on similar grounds it may be shown that in impossible mat
ter o may be converted both simply and accidentally for since
the terms of the proposition must by the matter essentially and
invariably differ the universal which contains this particular
must in such a case be true and it has been shown see note b

tributed a term would necessarily be distri
buted after conversion which was not so be
fore
that the simple and accidental converse of this proposition will
both be true and the simple and accidental converse of e will
thus become the same as the accidental and simple converse of
o eg let a case be taken in impossible matter let o be
true some men are not dogs then by the matter no
men are dogs is true
therefore the simple no dogs are men
 are also
and accidental converse f some dogs are not men both true
but the former of these is the accidental converse and the latter
is the simple converse of the exposita viz some men are not
dogs let the case be proved generally thus let it be as
sumed that the matter is impossible then some a is not b
is true but by the matter no a is b is true hence no
b is a and some b is not a are also true and these
two last propositions are the accidental and simple converse of
some a is not b

on syllogism

part iii section i
of argument

the third part of logic treats of argument
or syllogism which is the sign of the third
mental operation for discursus or reasoning
expressed in words is argument
reasoning or discourse having been de
fined to be the progress of the mind from one
or more judgements to another resulting from
them consequently every decomplex word
which expresses reasoning must consist of two
parts that which is proved and that by means
i of which it is proved that by means of which
i any thing is proved is generally called the anprtmises tecedent or premises and that which is proved
is called the inference or conclusion
connexion
the premises must have a connexion with
between the
premises each other for if this were not the case no
conclusion could possibly result from them
 the principles from the truth of which the conclusion is
drawn are supposed to be known quasi sine discursu as
aldrich observes chap iii √¢ß at least they must be laid
down as hypolhetically true i e they must antecedere or
 pramitti for which reason they are termed the antecedent
or the premises
the inference follows from the force of the premises hence
it is said to be concluded inferred collected or deduced from
them

on syllogism



e g jupiter was the king of the heathen
gods england is the mistress of the sea from two such judgements nothing could be
inferred for there is no connexion existing be
tween them and they do not in any way de
pend upon each other also there must be
such a relation between the two premises and and between
the premises
the conclusion that from a knowledge of the √¢£nconclut
former the mind must be irresistibly led to the
latter
consequence as employed in logic is the consequence
mode of showing the dependence which exists
between the antecedent and the consequent
i e between the premises and the conclusion 
there are two kinds of consequence the mate
rial and the formal
the material consequence b is when the con material
consequence
b every material argument may be reduced to a regular syllo
gism by supplying the proposition which is omitted e g to
take the example given below diamonds are jewels they
are therefore valuable in this case a proposition is omitted 
the truth of which is so manifest that it would in common dis
course be very allowable to leave it to the hearers judgement 
viz all jewels are valuable the argument when put into a
syllogism i e when reduced to its regular logical form will
stand thus 
 all jewels are valuable
 all diamonds are jewels 
therefore all diamonds are valuable
this reduction may seem unnecessary because it may be urged
that under its other form the inference was sufficiently obvious 
but yet it will be of advantage to reduce any material argument



on syllogism

sequent is inferred from the antecedent solely
by the matter of the argument i e by the
force or meaning attached to the terms e g
 diamonds are jewels they are therefore va
luable no brutes are human consequently
they are not rational some pleasures are
allowable for they are innocent
formal
the formal consequence is when the conseconsequence
quent is inferred from the antecedent from the
form only of the expression viz from the dis
position of the terms with respect to each
other e g
 all virtue is commendable
 temperance is a virtue 
therefore temperance is commendable
 all innocent things are allowable
 some pleasures are innocent 
therefore some pleasures are allowable

the formal consequence alone is regarded in
logic for since it depends solely on the dispo
sition of the terms with each other it cannot
ever fail but the material which depends
only on the meaning of the terms may fre
quently lead into error
to a syllogistic form because any error may then be more
easily detected for an argument which cannot be reduced to
the above regular and logical form cannot be legitimate just
in the same way it is often of use to ill up the ellipses in a sen
tence in order to see whether that sentence be grammatical
c for as aldrich observes chap iii s mutatis termini
et servata eorum dispositione materialis plerumque fallit for

on syllogism



a syllogism is an argument in which the syllogism
terms are so placed with respect to each other
that the conclusion results necessarily from the
premises from the mere force of the expres
sion and without any consideration of the
meaning of the terms themselves
aldrich d has defined a syllogism to be syjiosum
defined

 oratio in qua positis quibusdam atque concessis necesse est allied evenire prceter et prop
ter ea quce posita sunt atque concessa in
a syllogism the truth of the premises being
admitted it will be impossible to deny the con
clusion and even if the terms be changed the
inference will still hold good e g
 all islands are surrounded by water 
 england is an island
therefore england is surrounded by water

the truth of this conclusion is so apparent
that it needs not a proof for the mind when
malis semper obtinet since the material consequence de
pends entirely upon the power or meaning of the terms if these
terms be changed the consequence will not hold good at least
it will not result necessarily but in the formal consequence the
inference does result necessarily and this will stand good even
though the terms be changed if their order be preserved and 
although a conclusion may be false if the terms be changed
yet this circumstance will arise from the falsity of one of the
premises and not from the mode of inference i e not from the
force of expression which alone is regarded in logic
i see aldrich chap iii √¢ß i

 prater means that the conclusion must be distinct from
he premises and the word propter signifies that the con
clusion necessarily results by the force of those premises
t

on syllogism

once convinced of the truth of the two pre
mises cannot but admit that of the conclusion
also and this inference would be equally ap
parent even if the terras were changed and
any symbols were substituted in their place

preserved e g
every b is a

nonconformity to it their validity will inva

of the mmpie there are many kinds of syllogism but at
√¢Ä¢yiiogim present the simple categorical will be the only
one treated of the simple categorical syllogism

propositions the two first of which are termed
the premises or antecedent and the third is
called the conclusion or consequent the
conclusion before it forms a part of the syllo

truth is as yet uncertain but after it has been
proved and forms a part of the syllogism it is
no longer uncertain and is then termed the

term can be brought forward which may agree
with both of them they evidently cannot have
any thing in common with each other it will
therefore be impossible to prove that they
agree k
 quorum neutri inest quod non sit in alio
ea non differunt inter se
if there be any two terms which so exactly
agree with each other that there is not any
idea comprised in the one which is not also
comprised in the other it will be impossible to
prove that these two terms differ from each
other for manifestly no third term could be
adduced with which one of these terms would
agree and from which the other could differ 
 quce non probantur convenire in uno aliquo
eodemque tertio ea non probantur convenire
k thus let there be two terms men and plants and
since no third term can be adduced which will agree with both
these terms it will consequently be impossible to prove their
agreement i e to prove that men are plants
i again let there be the two terms animal and sensitive
being there is not any idea comprised in the one which is not
also comprised in the other therefore they must entirely agree
with each other for in this case no third term could be adduced
with which one of these terms would agree and from which the
other could differ

 if of two terms one agrees with tlte same
one third term from which the other differs
these two terms differfrom each other
it is upon the former of these that the va
lidity of all affirmative conclusions depends
and on the latter of all negative of these
rules dr whately speaks thus no catego
rical syllogism can be faulty which does not
violate these canons none correct which does
√¢ñ† on this passage of dr whately mr bentham makes the
following observation these two axioms thus expressed
are only applicable to those syllogisms in which the mean term
is universal in both premises for it is then only that the two
extremes are precisely equal to the same mean take for in
stance the syllogism every x is a y every y is a z there
fore every x is z if we prove it by the first of the above
axioms and say that the two terms x and z agree both with
the term y therefore they agree with one another and do not
take into account the signs of extent we should then be obliged
lo admit the truth of the syllogism√¢Äîan x is a y a z is a y
therefore an x is a z which is evidently false though strictly
conformable to dr whately s canons of which he says no
categorical syllogism can be faulty which does not violate these
canons√¢Äîoutline ofa new system of logic p now
putting aside the objection that might be raised at calling the
sentence an x is a y a z is a y therefore an x is a z a
syllogism when in reality it is not a syllogism at all yet so far



syllogistic canons

hence on these two canons are built the rules
or cautions which are to be observed with re
spect to syllogisms for the purpose of ascerfrom that sentence being strictly conformable to dr whatelys
canons it in fact is not conformable to them in any point of
view for in the sentence above there is no reason given which
may lead to a knowledge that the same part of y is referred to
in the two first propositions dr whatelys first canon says
that if two terms agree with one and the same third they
agree with one another now as it has been shown nothing
proves that this y is one and the same in both propositions 
hence it is manifest that the sentence which mr bentham has
adduced and which he terms a syllogism instead of being
strictly conformable to the above canon is not conformable to it
at all in short the very fact of its not being conformable to that
canon is the only reason why it is as mr bentham says
 evidently false it may perhaps be imagined that mr
bentham was not aware that this y could not be shown to be
one and the same term in both propositions but let us turn to
his outline p note where the following observation
may be found 
 every x is y
and again every x is y
some y is a
some y is b
therefore
therefore
some a is x
some b is x
 here it may be seen that no such conclusion can possibly
be drawn from the premises as nothing shows that it is the same
part of y that is referred to in both premises this needs no
comment it will be difficult to know under what head of falla
cies the above of mr benthams should be classed it seems
however to be most nearly allied to that of error of expres
sion of which he has treated p in which he says a
man may err either from ignorance or wilfully the very
elegant compliments which he has applied to those who do err
in either of the above ways need not be transcribed hepe as
they can only be duly appreciated by those who read his out

for every syllogism proves some conclusion
viz proves the agreement or disagreement of
two terms and these two terms are not proved
to agree or differ unless by comparing them

terms therefore and the third make three
hence no syllogism can have more than three
terms the following sentence therefore is
not a syllogism

in this apparent syllogism there are four
terms which are as follows hector the

the subject of the conclusion is called the minor
term the third term with which the major and
minor terms are each separately compared is
called the middle this term is called by aristo
tle the argument these names were assigned
because in an universal affirmative proposition
the predicate is commonly a more extensive
term than the subject whence arose the names
of major and minor so also the middle term is
commonly in direct syllogisms as will be seen
hereafter more extensive than the minor but
not so extensive as the major whence it re
ceived the name of middle

pared with the middle and there is the con
clusion in which the major and minor terms
p as there are but three terms which are to be compared to
gether i e the major minor and middle it is manifest that
only three comparative combinations can be made of three terms
taken two and two together viz the major with the middle the
minor with the middle and the minor with the major and
since no two terms can be compared but by a proposition hence
there cannot be more than three propositions in a syllogism

are compared with each other and the two
premises with the conclusion make three pro
positions
n b that premiss in which the major
term is compared with the middle is called the
major premiss and that in which the minor is
compared with the middle is called the minor
premiss

n b the major premiss is sometimes the proposi
tion and
termed the propositioni and the minor assumption
is called the assumption
 the middle term must not enter the con
clusion for in such a case there would not be
any inferende drawn since the two extremes
of the question would not have been compared
i the major premiss is called the proposition by way of
eminence because when a syllogism is in its most perfect form
the major premiss is generally some wellknown and universal
principle which is not likely to be disputed it is the minor pre
miss that is most liable to objection because generally speak
ing it is an assertion the truth of which is assumed with parti
cular reference to the question which is to be proved hence the
name assumption e g
 all islands are surrounded by water 
 england is an island
therefore england is surrounded by water
in this example the major premiss all islands are sur
rounded by water is a wellknown general truth whereas
 england is an island is not a universal principle as the
major is though accidentally it may be as well known but
yet in order to prove that england is surrounded by water
it must be assumed that it is an island

compared with the same part hence one of
the extremes may have been compared with
 an instance of this fundamental error may be found in mr
benthams outline of a new system of logic in which he
objects to dr whatelys mode of treating modal propositions
and hypothetical in the following words 
 with regard to hypotheticals propositions and syllogisms
are also in some measure confounded together in the elements
a hypothetical proposition is there defined two or more categoricals united by a copula or conjunction amongst these
conjunctions are the causal in page we learn that a syllo
gism consists of three categorical propositions united by a
causal conjunction might we not from these premises draw
the conclusion that a syllogism is a hypothetical proposition
p 
now so far from being able to draw such a conclusion the
real fact is that from such premises no conclusion whatsoever
can possibly be drawn mr bentham does not seem to have
been aware that the form of such an argument was faulty or
surely he would not have asked such a question as the above
let us place the propositions of this apparent syllogism in their
clearest light and afterwards substitute for the terms some
symbols the error will then be obvious 
the argument stands thus
 a hypothetical proposition is two or more categoricals
united by a causal conjunction
 a syllogism consists of three categorical propositions united
by a causal conjunction 
therefore a syllogism is a hypothetical proposition this
may be expressed in general terms thus 
 an x is a y
 a z is a y
therefore a z is an x
mr bentham speaking of this very form of argument which
he terms a syllogism observes p that it is evidently
false but t must again quote his own words by which it will
appear that although mr bentham sometimes makes use of a

other part of it e g

in these examples the middle term is not

four terms
rule if the middle term be once distri one dutriou

for if one extreme has been compared with
the whole of the middle and the other with a
part of it they will in reality have been com
pared with the same termu e g

sophistical argument he is not ignorant of the rules of logic 
speaking of a similar form of argument to the preceding he
says here it may be seen that no such conclusion can possibly
be drawn from the premises as nothing shows that it is the same
part of y that is referred to in both premises p note
one question naturally arises from this why did mr bentham ask whether such a conclusion might not be drawn from
such premises when he must have known that no such con
clusion could possibly be drawn 
√¢ñ† the first canon is that when two terms both agree with
one and the same third term they agree with each other now
this cannot be shown to be the case unless that third term be
once taken in its most extensive signification for if one extreme
agrees with all the middle and the other with a part of it they
do in fact agree with the same term and therefore agree with

k



general rules

all valuable knowledge is worth obtaining 
 a correct knowledge of logic is valuable knowledge
therefore a correct knowledge of logic is worth obtaining

in this case since one of the extremes agrees
with the whole of the middle and the other
with a part of it they both must entirely agree
with that part of the middle and they thereeach other and this may be shown by the following argument
which will be true provided it be admitted that the same par of
the middle is compared with both extremes e g
 all metals are fusible 
 lead is fusible 
therefore lead is a metal
now if it be granted that the two extremes metals and
 lead are compared to the third term fusible and to the
same part of it then this consequence may be materially in
ferred but this cannot be proved unless the middle be ones
taken in its most extensive sense in which case it will be mani
fest that the same part will have been compared with both of
the extremes and this part of the middle may be considered as
one single term with which both the extremes have been com
pared the case is similar where one extreme agrees with the
same part of the middle from which the other differs e g
 some men are not sophists 
 some men are good logicians 
therefore some good logicians are not sophists
in this case the inference will be materially true if it be ad
mitted that the same class of men is meant in both premises
but as before this cannot be proved unless the middle term be
once distributed hence the above arguments are incorrect in
form though true in sense i e materially it was from not
considering this fact that mr bentham so much objects to dr
whatelys mode of proving this rule outline p there
may be some slight ambiguity in dr whatelys mode of expres
sion but his meaning is sufficiently manifest and clear

this is termed an illicit process of the major inicuprocess
or minor term arid to employ a term univer

tially employed in the premiss must of course
be erroneous for the universal cannot be in
ferred from the particular in fact as dr
whately observes p there would be four
terms e g
 every virtuous act is worthy of commendation 
 profane swearing is not a virtuous act 
therefore profane swearing is not worthy of commendation

this conclusion could not be inferred from
such premises for the major term is illicitly
distributed and though the proposition may
be true yet its truth cannot be inferred from
the premises there are in fact two major
terms instead of one viz some acts worthy
x in all perfect arguments the middle term ought not to be
more than once distributed this will appear more evidently
hereafter
j this rule as well as the two preceding may be considered
as branches of the first viz that in every syllogism there
must not be more than three terms for an undistributed term 
and the same distributed cannot be called one term be
sides to draw an inference from any term partially employed
to the same term employed universally is the same thing as in

forward from which both extremes differ and
this fact does not afford any grounds for in

no conclusion can be drawn from such pre

but these premises will not prove their agree

ferring the universal from the truth of the particular which is
illicit as has been shown above partii for a distri
buted term bears the same proportion to the same undistributed
as the universal to its particular
 let any two terms both differ from another third these
terms cannot be said to agree together for if so they would
both agree with the third neither can it be inferred that they

therefore one only must be distributed in the conclusion but the
conclusion must be negative because of the negative premiss
and in order to distribute but one term it must be particular
negative the last case viz ao may be proved exactly in the
same way as the second and the conclusion in this case also
must be a particular negative this eleventh rule therefore is

inferred from universal premises provided it
be possible without an illicit process for

e these twelve rules are wholly founded upon the two first
syllogistic canons consequently recourse must be had to these
canons in order to prove any one of them and when any viola

parison made of the two extremes with one and the same third
terra with which they both agree or with which one agrees
and from which the other differs

it is obvious that the number of these rules
may be very much lessened e g the third
fourth fifth and sixth are contained under
the first so that these rules may all be com
prised under the five following 
 there must not be more than three terms
in any syllogism this rule includes rules 
 and 
 in every syllogism there are but three
propositions
 the premises must not be both negative
 if one premiss be negative the conclu
sion must be so and vice versa this includes
rules and 
 a particular conclusion may be deduced
from universal premises h

 the deeds of good men are not wicked deeds

in the above syllogisms the conclusions ought to be universally
drawn the particular conclusions are therefore inaccurate

a syllogism are designated in their proper
order according to their quantity and quality

 nothing that should be avoided is commendable

of moods

correct or not we mast apply to these twelve rules for no syllo

of these the following order will perhaps be found to be the
most convenient for applying them count the terms and
propositions look to the distribution of the middle

three of these when combined form a mood
it may thus be proved that the whole number
of permutations which can possibly be formed
will be sixtyfourv for each of these four pro
positions may be used as a major premiss and
each of these major premises will admit of four
different minors viz a e i or o therefore
there may be formed four times four or six

the figure of a syllogism depends upon the
situation of the middle term with reference to
the extremes of the question i e the major
and the minor terms
four figure
there are only four figures for since there
are but three terms to be compared together in
a syllogism and the middle term is confined to
the premises it is manifest that the middle
could not be placed in more thanfour different
situations with respect to the major and minor
terms
km figure
in the first figure the middle term is the
subject of the major premiss and the predicate
of the minor
√¢∞ thus the following argument is incorrect 
 some learned men are much addicted to prejudice 
 none who are much addicted to prejudice are men of power
ful minds 
therefore some men of powerful minds are not learned
for in this apparent syllogism there is an illicit process of
the major term learned and this must be the case however
the order of the terms of the argument be changed viz in every
figure hence this mood is necessarily and essentially incorrect

on the figures



in the seeond figure the middle term is the second figure
predicate of both premises
in the third figure the middle term is the third figure
subject of both premises
in the fourth figure the middle term is the fourth figure
predicate of the major premiss and the subject
of the minor p
it is to be remembered that of the pre order of the
premises

raises the major premiss ought properly to be
placed first and the minor second for other
wise the first figure might appear to be the
fourth and the fourth might be taken for the
first the major premiss is that in which the
major term is compared with the middle
wherever it happens to be placed so the

in this scheme the terms of the propositions

of these figures each contains six moods
which will not violate any of the twelve rules
given above it is obvious therefore that the
same mood must be allowable in different
figures e g iai and aaj in the third and
fourth figures and eae eio in the first and
second with many others so also it may be
found by examination that a mood which will
be allowable in one figure will violate some
rule if used in another thus aaa is allow
able in the first figure but if it were used in
i by means of this scheme it will be easy to discover in what
figure any syllogism may be as well as to make a syllogism in
any particular figure by determining the quantity and quality
of the different propositions and by taking care not to violate
any one of the twelve rules given in the last section

the third or fourth the result would be an illi
cit process of the minor r although each nameless




figure admits of six moods yet several of these
are useless inasmuch as their conclusions are
particular when the universal might have been
inferred e g eao in the first figure
k

 nothing which belongs to man is perfect 
 every art is that which belongs to man 
hence some art is not perfect

here an universal conclusion might have
been inferred therefore the particular though
valid is useless and inaccurate of these
moods there are five in number out of the
twentyfour which may be used in all the
figures for the nineteen which remain ex
cluding these five certain names have been
formed by logicians which serve to denote the
mood and figure for as it was before ob
served the same mood without regarding the
figures is used in different figures hence the
 thus in the third figure
 all felons are thieves 
 all felons are amenable to the law 
therefore all who are amenable to the law are thieves
again in the fourth figure
 all thieves are felons 
 all felons are amenable to the law 
therefore all who are amenable to the law are thieves
in both these examples it will be seen that there is an illicit
process of the minor term
 thus aai iai and eao are allowable in the third and

moods

vowels which denote the mood would not

in the above lines the three vowels denote
the mood i e the propositions of which the

to designate the particular figure by mentioning the vowels only

use in reduction as will be seen hereafter
 whatever mood has an universal conclusion must of course
contain a nameless mood under it and since there cannot be
more xanfive moods in which an universal conclusion can be
inferred from universal premises viz barbara celarent cesare camestres and camenes hence it is obvious that there

from the first and second of the syllogistic the nrst
canons it follows that these twentyfour moods √¢£re√¢te
are conclusive but of all the four figures the
first is the most evident for it is the clearest
and most natural and to it aristotles dic
tum de omni et nullo is immediately appli
cable
the axiom which the schoolmen term the the mnam
 dictum de omni et nullo is that test which nuiio
may ultimately be applied to all legitimate
arguments and by their conformity or non
conformity to it their validity will in all cases
depend it is thus explained by aldrich
 quod prcedicatur universauter de alio i e
de termino distributor sive affirmative sive ne
gative prcedicatur similiter de omnibus sub eo
contentis viz that which is predicated of
a term distributed whether affirmatively or ne
gatively may in like manner be predicated of
every thing contained under it there needs an axiom
no proof to establish the truth of this rule for
 chap iii √¢ß 



on reduction

it is selfevident and may therefore be justly
termed an axiom
the four moods of the first figure viz bar
bara celarent darii and ferio are under
their present form immediately applicable to
this dictum e g
 a good king should be obeyed by his subjects 
 george the fourth is a good king 
therefore george the fourth should be obeyed by his subjects

in this syllogism the major term is predi
cated of the middle distributed consequently
by the above axiom the major can be predi
cated of any term which the middle contains 
i e of which the middle can be predicated 
but in the minor premiss the middle term is
predicated of the minor consequently the
major may be predicated of the minor thus
the dictum of aristotle is immediately appli
cable to all the four moods of the first figure 
and this circumstance depends solely on the
 the case is exactly similar where the conclusion is nega
tive e g
 no mau can serve two masters
 you are a man 
therefore you cannot serve two masters
here the major term is negatively predicated of the middle
distributed therefore it can be negatively predicated of any
term comprehended by that middle but in the minor premiss
it is asserted that the minor is comprehended under the middle
hence the major can be negatively predicated of the minor

major and minor in other words upon the
figure whence the moods of this figure were
termed by aristotle the perfect moods be the perfect


moods
cause they do not require any change in order
to make their conclusions more evident y the
schoolmen called them the direct moods
because their conclusions can be directly in
ferred from the premises
the moods of the second third and fourth
figures are owing to the position of the middle
term not so evident as those of the first for
aristotles dictum cannot be immediately ap
plied though ultimately this may be effected 
and when this is done the syllogism is said to
be reduced i e brought into the form of the
first figure it is on this account that these
moods were termed imperfect and in the imperfect

moods
direct for the dictum cannot be immediately
applied to them without their undergoing some
change in the order of their terms i e with
out arranging those terms in such a manner
that the moods instead of being in the second
third or fourth figures are changed into the
first and when this is effected these moods
i they are also called perfect because nothing more is im
plied in the premises than is necessary to prove the conclusion
which is not the case with the other moods which are therefore
termed imperfect

are said to be perfici revocare or reduci
heducticn
reduction may therefore be defined the
changing of any imperfect mood and bringing
it into the more perfect form of the first figure
so that the necessity of the inference may be
come more apparent
of two kinds
there are two kinds of reduction viz ostensive reduction and reductio ad impossibile
extensive

ostensive reduction is the direct mode of

reduction

proof viz it shows that the conclusion is true
by changing the order of the terms of the re
duced syllogism and drawing from them either
 see aldrich chap iii √¢ß 
a there are two modes by which all conclusions may be
proved vii the direct and the indirect the direct mode is
where the original conclusion is shown to be true by placing
those principles from which it is deduced in such a manner
that the conclusion results from them necessarily so that the
mind cannot but immediately admit the truth of the conclusion
after having admitted the truth of the premises the indirect
mode is that in which the conclusion is assumed to befalse and
then showing that from this assumption some palpable absurdity
must result the necessary consequence of this is that the as
sumption must be false hence the conclusion which was pro
forma assumed false must in reality be true the latter of
these modes generally strikes the students mind most forcibly
and is in most cases the easiest thus in order to prove any
rule the best way is to violate the rule and trace the conse
quences of such violation to their source the result will then
become apparent and the validity of the rule will be esta
blished

on reduction



the same conclusion as before or the converse
of it
it is obvious that in ostensiveh reducing a
syllogism we must not introduce any terms dif
ferent from those in the reduced syllogism nor
any new proposition all that we have granted
to us is that the premises of the syllogism which
we wish to reduce are true hence we may of
course transpose them or convert them illatively
for if any proposition be granted true it is allow
able see part ii √¢ß to infer the truth of its
converse and it is by making use of this liberty
when necessary that all imperfect syllogisms
may be ostensively reduced b it was principally use of tue
nii

names of the

for this purpose that the names were invented moods
b although reductio ad impossibile is most commonly em
ployed for the two moods baroko and bokardo yet both of these
moods may be reduced ostensively by making use of conversion
by contraposition in which case baroko will be reduced to
ferio and bokardo to darii see part ii √¢ß thus let an
example be taken in baroko 
 every virtuous act is worthy of commendation 
 some human acts are not worthy of commendation 
 some human acts are not virtuous
this syllogism may be reduced to ferio by converting the major
premiss by contraposition thus 
 anactwhichisnotworthyofcommendation is not a vir
tuous act
 some human acts are notworthyofcommendation 
 some human acts are not virtuous
thus also bokardo may be reduced to dorii by transposing the
premises and employing conversion by contraposition
m



on reduction

to all the different moods and in each of those
names it must be remembered that the three
vowels denote as was before remarked the
mood the initial consonants viz b c d f

show to what mood in the first figure the syllo
gism is to be reduced i e that mood whose
initial consonant is the same the letters s
and p denote that tkose propositions to which
they are affixed must be converted either sim
ply s or per accidens p m denotes that
the premises must be transposed and k shows
that the syllogism must be reduced by reductio
ad impossibile which will be explained hereexampiesof after these rules being borne in mind the
reduction

√¢∞
reduction of a syllogism is a mere mechanical
operation c e g
cam every man of sense is anxious to gain useful informa
tion
es
 no idle man is anxious to gain useful information 
tres no idle man is a man of sense

in this syllogism m shows that we must trans
pose the premises and denotes the simple
conversion of both the minor premiss and the
conclusion and if these things be done the
c it must be remembered that these letters are intended to
apply to the vowels which precede and not to those which follow
them thus in datisi the minor premiss is to be simply con
verted and not the conclusion and in like manner with all the
other moods so also the letter k applies to the preceding vowel
in baroko and bokardo and not to the vowel that follows it

on reduction



syllogism will be found to be in the first figure
and in the mood celarent as the letter c in camestres denotes
ce

 no person who is anxious to gain useful informa
tion is an idle man 
ia
 every man of sense is anxious to gain useful in
formation 
rent no man of sense is an idle man

again disarms may be reduced to darii thus 
dis
am
is
da
rl
i

 some musicians are mad
 all musicians are men 
 some men are mad
 all musicians are men 
 some mad beings are musicians 
 some mad beings are men

in these two examples the simple converse
of the original conclusion is shown to be true
d all imperfect moods although their conclusions are true
are forced to imply more than they express in their premises in
order to prove the necessity of their conclusions thus in ferison e g
 no mahometans are christians 
 some mahometans are men of good understanding 
therefore some men of good understanding are not chris
tians
in order to prove this conclusion true it will be necessary to
convert the minor premiss simply thus 
 no mahometans are christians 
 some men of good understanding are mahometans 
therefore some men of good understanding are not christians
this syllogism which is in the first figure viz ferio may be
immediately applied to the dictum de omni et nullo and its
conclusion is therefore correctly inferred but the simple con
verse of the minor was implied though not eipressed in the ori
ginal syllogism

m



on reduction

by applying it to the dictum of aristotle viz
by reducing the original syllogism to the first
figure and since the converse of its conclusion
is shown to be true the truth of the original
conclusion itself may be implied
reductioad
the process
ofreductio ad impossibile
is as

m
follows in the two moods to which it is usually
applied viz baroko and bokardo substitute
the contradictory of the conclusion for the par
ticular negative premiss and from the two
universal affirmative premises thus formed
draw a conclusion in barbara this conclu
sion will be false because it will contradict a
premiss which was hypothetically true conse
quently it may be inferred that the contradic
tory of the original conclusion must be false
and therefore the conclusion itself must have
been true this will be more fully treated of in
the next section



c again camenes maybe reduced to celarent by transposing
the premises and simply converting the conclusion thus e g
 all useful arts are worth learning 
 nothing that is worth learning is of no value 
therefore that which is of no value is not a useful art 
reduced thus to celarent 
 nothing that is worth learning is of no value 
 all useful arts are worth learning 
therefore no useful arts are of no value
and note that whenever the premises of any syllogism are
transposed in its reduction the conclusion must necessarily be
converted for since the major premiss is made the minor so
also the major term must be made the minor

on the validity of reduction



section vii
gt
the validity of ostensive reduction is mani √¢Ñ¢jy
extensive
reduction
fest for the premises of the syllogism being
hypothetically true they must be equally true
when either transposed or illatively converted

 in order to reduce bramantip ostensively it is necessary to
convert the conclusion accidentally e g
 all true patriots have their countrys welfare at heart
 all who have their countrys welfare at heart are friends
to religion 
therefore some friends to religion are true patriots
this syllogism which is bramantip may thus be reduced to
barbara 
 all who have their countrys welfare at heart are friends
to religion 
 all true patriots have their countrys welfare at heart 
therefore all true patriots are friends to religion
the reason why in this mood the conclusion i may be acci
dentally converted is that the major term has been distributed in
the major premiss and therefore is distributable in the conclusion 
although owing to the figure it cannot be distributed it has
been laid down in rule √¢ß of this part that a term must
not be distributed in the conclusion if it has not been distributed
in its premiss and it should be remembered also that a term
ought not to be undistributed in the conclusion if it has been dis
tributed in its premiss not that there will be any incorrectness
in the syllogism if the term be undistributed in the conclusion 
but such a mode of argument is very inaccurate and unscientific 
for in the case of bramantip more is assumed with respect to
the major term in the premises than can possibly be inferred in
the conclusion consequently this mood is the worst of all the
moods it being the only one in which this inaccuracy occurs
it may be observed that w lieu from accidental circumstances it

m

on the validity

and the conclusion of the syllogism when re
duced is either the same as the original one
or is only its illative converse and in the latter
case it is obvious that the truth of the original
conclusion may be inferred from the truth of
its converse which is the conclusion of the
syllogism when reduced hence this reduction
is termed ostensive because it shows directly
that the original conclusion is true e g
ca all men are liable to err 
me no being who is liable to err is perfect 
nes no perfect being is a man

this syllogism which is in the fourth figure
may be reduced to the first by transposing the
premises and simply converting the conclusion
thus
ce no being who is liable to err is perfect 
a all men are liable to err 
rent no man is perfect
is known that the predicate of i is distributable it follows that
the matter of the proposition must be necessary hence in all
such cases i may be converted both simply and per accident
and such conversion will under these circumstances be illative
in the same manner it has been shown p ho note f that in
impossible matter may be converted both simply and per accidens it must not however be supposed that the conclusion
which is drawn from two universal affirmative propositions will
in all cases be in necessary matter because it is so in bramantip 
for in darapti the matter of the conclusion is generally contin
gent though in bramantip it is invariably necessary but this
depends as was shown before on the distribution of the major
term in its premiss and not because both the premises are uni
versal affirmative

of reduction



in the first figure the simple converse of the
original conclusion is shown to be true hence
it may be inferred that the original conclusion
itself must likewise be true
reductio ad impossibile is the indirect mode of reductio
ad impossiof proof which is to admit the falsity of a bile 
conclusion and show that by arguing from
such falsity an absurdity or impossibility will
result this mode of reduction is not usually
applied to any moods except baroko and bokardo but it must not therefore be supposed
that it is not equally applicable to any others
foe in
fact all moods may be reduced byj re may
au moods

be thus
ductio ad impossibile as well as ostensively g reduceds since there are two modes of reduction viz ostensive and
ad impossibile and as it has been shown that every mood may be
reduced by ostensive reduction it may not perhaps be uninterest
ing to observe how the reductio ad impossibile may also be ap
plied to all the moods although it is generally employed for
baroko and bokardo only the process of reductio ad impossibile
is to assume the conclusion to be false and then trace the con
sequence of this assumption which will in all cases be some
palpable absurdity thus let a case be taken in ferison 
no men of bad principles are to be trusted 
 some men of bad principles are pleasant companions 
therefore some pleasant companions are not to be trusted
this syllogism may thus be reduced to darii by employing
reduetio ad impossibile 
 all pleasant companions are to be trusted 
 some men of bad principles are pleasant companions
therefore √¢Ä¢ some men of bad principles are to be trusted
in this reduction the conclusion was assumed to be false and
its contradictory was therefore assumed to be true and from this



its validity

on the validity

the validity of reductio ad impossibile may
be shown thus every conclusion must be
contradictory united to the original minor premiss a new con
clusion was drawn in darii this conclusion is manifestlyfalse
because it contradicts the original major premiss consequently
as is the case in baroko or bokardo it must necessarily follow
that the contradictory of the original conclusion which was as
sumed true is in reality false hence the original conclusion it
self must be true
if reductio ad impossibile be employed for all the different
moods it will be found that in this manner all their conclusions
may be shown to be true for the new conclusion will either con
tradict an original premiss or else some proposition the truth of
which is deducible from that premiss such as the particular
contained by it or its simple or accidental converse thus in fesapo
 no unjust act is commendable
 every commendable act deserves reward 
therefore some act deserving of reward is not an unjust act
h may be shown that this conclusion cannot befalse by re
ducing it to barbara thus 
 every act deserving of reward is an unjust act 
 every commendable act deserves reward 
therefore every commendable act is an unjust act
this conclusion contradicts the accidental converse of the ori
ginal major premiss and must therefore be false for since the
major premiss is hypothetically true hence it follows by the
laws of conversion that its accidental converse must also be
trite therefore the contradictory of this accidental converse
must befalse from this fact it may as before be inferred that
the original conclusion cannot befalse i e it must be true
by adopting some measures similar to the above it may be
shown that every mood may be reduced by reductio ad impossi
bile and although this is of no practical use yet it may be bene
ficial to the student in logic to practise himself in employing
this kind of reduction to the different moods whereby he will



of reduction



either true or false let it be assumed to
be false then its contradictory must be true 
let therefore its contradictory be taken as a
new premiss and to it let one of the original
premises be joined place these premises in
such a manner that the middle term may stand
as in the first figure then draw the conclusion
from them and it will be found that this new
conclusion will contradict an original premiss h
make himself perfectly acquainted with the different figures and
the manner of proving a conclusion true by reducing it to the
first figure at the same time applying the rules of contradictory
opposition in order to render this easy the names of the moods
have been altered in the following lines in which the letter k
as before denotes that the contradictory of the conclusion must
he substituted for that premiss which precedes it the initial
letter showing to what mood in the first figure the syllogism
roust be reduced 
barbara celarent darii ferioque prions 
ferake dathleke celiko baroko secundae 
tertia cankari cikali fakiri beckaro
bokardo dekilon habet quarta insuper addit
clakanti daleke cilkari belkaro dekiron
it is not intended that reductio ad impossibile should in
practice be ever employed for the reduction of moods but
merely to show that every mood may be reduced both osten
sibly and by reductio ad impossibile viz that both the direct
and indirect mode of proof may be applied to every syllogism
 in the two moods baroko and bokardo for which reductio
ad impossibile is usually employed the new conclusion contra
dicts an original premiss but if this reduction be used for any
of the other moods it will be found as was observed in the last
qote that the new conclusion will not always contradict an ori
ginal premiss but sometimes a proposition the truth of which is



on the validity

which was granted true consequently the new
conclusion must be false now as the form of
the argument is correct the error must lie in
one of the premises and it is manifest which
one of the premises it must be for one of them
is an original one which was hypothetically
true therefore the new premiss which was
assumed to be true must in reality he false
viz the contradictory of the original conclusion
has been proved to be false therefore the ori
ginal conclusion itself must be true e g
bar every wise man is contented 
ok some men are not contented 
 some men are not wise

this syllogism may thus be reduced to bar
bara
 every wise man is contented granted true
 every man is wise assumed true
therefore every man is contented

this conclusion is manifestly false because
it is the contradictory of the original minor
deducible from an original premiss such as the particular con
tained under it or its simple or accidental converse which will
be equally efficacious towards proving that the original conclu
sion cannot be false
 in the two moods baroko and bokardo the contradictory of
the conclusion must be substituted for the particular negative
premiss keeping the universal premiss in its original situation 
with respect to the other moods which may be reduced by this
mode the contradictory of the conclusion must be made the
major or minor premiss according as may be necessary for form
ing the syllogism in the first figure by referring however to

of reduction



premiss which is hypothetically true and
since the form is correct one of the premises
must hefalse this cannot be the major for it
was granted true in the original syllogism
therefore the minor premiss viz every man
is wise which was assumed to be true must
in reality be false consequently the contra
dictory to this minor premiss must be true
but the contradictory to
 every man is wise is
 some men are not wise 

and this is the original conclusion which has
thus been proved to be truek
the memorial lines given in note g p no mistake can possibly
arise from this circumstance for the contradictory of the con
clusion must be substituted for that premiss which next precedes
the letter k keeping the other premiss in its original situation
k again to give another example in bokardo
 some good acts are not duly rewarded 

 all good acts deserve to be rewarded 
therefore some acts which deserve to be rewarded are not
duly rewarded 
reduced to barbara thus
 all acts which deserve reward are duly rewarded 
 all good acts deserve reward 
therefore all good acts are duly rewarded
this new conclusion must be false because it contradicts the
original major premiss therefore the major premiss from which
it was drawn must be fake therefore its contradictory which
is the original conclusion must be true



on the special rules

it has already been shown that syllogisms
may be formed in twentyfour moods viz six
in each figure and in some one of these moods
any conclusion may be inferred whicb can be
drawn from a simple categorical syllogism 
the special
the same mood cannot always be used in
rules
every figure see p without violating some
one of the twelve rules given in part iii √¢ß 
hence certain special rules or rather cautions
have been laid down with respect to all the
figures by a due observance of which a syllo
gism may be made in each figure without vio
lating any rule

minor memiss arhrma

special rules of the first figure
rule the minor premiss must be affrmafive
 the number of moods in which any conclusion may be
drawn are as follows 
a may be proved in one mood only viz barbara
e may be proved in four moods viz celarent cesare cflmestres and camenes
i may be proved in seven moods viz darii and all in the
first figure in varapti disamis dathi bramantip and dimaris
 may be proved in twelve moods viz ferio and eao in
the first figure in festino baroko and eao aeo in the
second in felapton bokardo and ferison in the third and
in fesapo fresison and aeo in the fourth figure

on the special rules



for ifnot let it be negative then the major
premiss must by rule m be affirmative and
will not distribute the major term because
the major in this figure is the predicate of its
premiss but the conclusion must by rule 
be negative and will distribute its predicate
viz the major term and this term was shown
not to have been distributed before hence
there will be an illicit process of the major 
consequently the minor premiss must not be ne
gative i e it must be affirmativen q e d
rule 

the major xpremiss must be uni universal
majorpremi√¢

for let it be particular then its subject
which is the middle term is not distributed 
and by the last rule the minor premiss must be
affirmative consequently its predicate which

was shown not to be distributed in the major
premiss therefore the middle is undistributed

m the rules which are here alluded to are the twelve rules
laid down in the third section of this part
n thus for example

 every true christian is a lover of his god 
 no atheist is a true christian
therefore no atheist is a lover of his god
this conclusion although apparently correct cannot be de

the conclusion which was not distributed in its premiss

to find a mu

on the special rules

hence it is manifest with what middle term
any conclusion may be proved e g to
prove a particular affirmative conclusion a
middle must be brought forward which is
wholly contained by one extreme and which
itself contains a part of the other as in the
first figure or by a middle term which repre
sents that of which both the extremes are
qualities as in the third figure or lastly by
a middle which comprehends one extreme
and is itself comprehended under that class
of which the other extreme is a part as in the
fourth figure
√¢ñ† caue should be taken that more be not laid down in the
premises than is abstdutely necessary to prove the conclusion 
for this would give an opponent an opportunity of raising an ob
jection when it might easily be avoided e g
 all planets are more distant than the moon 
 all planets can be seen from the earth 
therefore some bodies which can be seen from the earth are
more distant than the mopn
in this syllogism an objection might be raised against the mi
nor premiss because it might be argued that possibly some
planets could not be seen from the earth and this objection
might be obviated by making the minor premiss particular
without any detriment to the syllogism hence in this argument
more is laid down in the premises than is necessary for proving
the conclusion it is on this account that darapti and felaptoa
are not so accuraie as either disamis datisi bokardo or ferison so in the fourth figure bramantip and fesapo are less accu
rate than dimaris and fresison because the premises need not
be both universal in order to prove a particular conclusion

on the special rules



n b a nameless mood ought not to
be brought forward to prove a conclusion for
since the conclusion is particular when it ought
to have been universal hence more has been
laid down in the premises than was necessary
for proving the conclusion
 of all the four figures the fourth is the
worst for it is the most unnatural of all and
 mr bentham in one sentence consigns to oblivion the
whole aristotelian system of moods figures etc it will be en
tertaining enough to read this sweeping sentence i think there
fore that it is worth transcribing he observes as to the
six or seven rules for trying syllogisms the theory of moods
and figures the ostensive reduction the reductio ad impossibile
and tbe indications conveyed by the consonants employed in the
 barbara verses contained in sections to of this part of
dr whatelys elements as well as the theory of opposition ex
plained in of part ii all these are no doubt very ingenious
contrivances and indicate great powers of mind on the part of
the grecian philosopher who invented them but if mere re
duction with the help of the above four axioms viz my
axioms mr bentham means to say be found to answer the pur
pose and to be sufficiently clear and comprehensible this whole
aristotelian system might henceforth be very properly consigned
to oblivion as tending rather to conceal than to expose fallacies
to impede rather than to assist fair intellectual argument
outline p again he says if my reduction of propo
sitions to the abovementioned five formulae be adopted the se
veral rules of distribution given in p of the elements
become useless outline p it is surely very proper
that every author should have a good opinion of himself and of
the dignity which should be attached to his own lucubrations and
it is on this account that i have transcribed the above sentences
as tending to show the dignity which ought to be attached to
the benthamian system of logic and as containing a better spe



on the special rules

in it the middle is by implication predicated
of itself thus b 

therefore

 every wise man is contented
 every contented man is happy 
 some happy men are wise

in this syllogism the middle term contented
is predicated of every wise man this in the
conclusion is predicated of the minor happy
man and this minor happy man is predicated
in the minor premiss of the middle contented
consequently the middle is by implication pre
dicated of itself
cimen of selfcomplacency comprised in so few words than i
ever remember to have met with in any other author
 dr whately has shown p that beginning at the con
clusion it will appear that the major term seems to be predi
cated of itself thus the major is predicated of the minor the
minor of the middle and the middle of the major i e appa
rently the major is predicated of itself
c this will be more manifest if expressed thus shortly the
middle is predicated of the major the major of the minor and the
minor of the middle thus it is implied that the middle is predi
cated of the middle this must of course be superfluous and it is
principally on this account that the fourth figure appears so un
natural for the conclusion does not seem to result necessarily
from the premises hence it is scarcely ever used in argument 
in fact it is of no practical use whatsoever

on the enthymeme



section ix
there are many other kinds of arguments different
√¢∞
kinds of arwhich are not correct syllogisms yet may easily kumentsbe brought into the regular form such as the
following 
 the enthymeme is a defective syllo of enthygism which consists of one premiss and a con
clusion e g
 diamonds are jewels they are therefore valuable 
 god is a spirit therefore he is eternal

an enthymeme may easily be reduced to a
regular syllogistic form for since the conclu
sion and one premiss are given the three
terms may be known and the omitted premiss
may be supplied thus in the above example
the major all jewels are valuable is omit
ted see p note b and if supplied the
syllogism will be regular d thus 

d in common discourse the usual mode of expressing an argu
ment is by means of the enthymeme it being unnecessary to
adduce both the premises when one is so evident that it may
very fairly be left to the hearers judgement e g
 when we find a book quoted or referred to by an ancient au
thor we are entitled to conclude that it was read and received
in the age and country in which that author lived this
sentence is an enthymeme in which the major premiss is sup
pressed but which may easily be supplied as follows every



therefore

therefore

on the enthymeme
 all jewels are valuable 
 diamonds are jewels 
 diamonds are valuable√¢Äîagain 
 every spirit is eternal 
 god is a spirit
 god is eternal

in both these examples the major premiss
is suppressed for as was before observed
the major premiss is generally speaking some
universal and incontrovertible principle which
is so evident that it is left to the hearers
judgement but the minor premiss is most com
monly expressed because it has more particu
lar reference to the question which is to be
proved see p note q
an enthymeme is sometimes condensed into
one sentence which is called an enthymematic
book quoted or referred to by an ancient author must have
been read and received iu the age and country in which that
author lived the sentence may thus be reduced to a regular
syllogism in barbara this may be effected in most enthymemes
without much difficulty whether their conclusions be negative
or affirmative
 although the major premiss is generally suppressed in most
enthymemes yet there are some enthymemes in which the
minor premiss is found to be omitted this may happen when the
minor premiss is very evident or when much stress is meant to
be laid upon the major e g every tyrannical king deserves
to be deposed by his subjects therefore nero deserved to be
deposed by the romans the minor premiss which is sup
pressed may be thus supplied 
 nero was a tyrannical king
and thus the argument is educed to the regular syllogistic form

on induction



sentence viz when the premiss is united in
one proposition with the conclusion e g all
machines being of human manufacture are
liable to imperfections this argument may
be thus expanded into a regular syllogism 
 all things of human manufacture are liable to im
perfections
 all machines are of human manufacture 
therefore they are liable to imperfections 

 induction is the inferring an universal induction
conclusion from a great number of particular
facts i e when any fact has been ascer
tained with respect to a great many individuals
of a class by induction we infer that the same
fact is predicable of all that class g

f the following are some examples of enthymematic sen
tences is an enterprise fraught with evil such as the present
likely to prosper this question may thus be reduced to a
syllogistic form 
an evil enterprise is not likely to prosper
 the present enterprise is evil 
therefore the present enterprise is not likely to prosper
again useful knowledge is too difficult of attainment to be
within the reach of the idle
this sentence may be thus syllogistically expressed 
 nothing which is difficult of attainment is within
the reach of the idle 
 all useful knowledge is difficult of attainment 
therefore useful knowledge is not within the reach of the
idle
this is a regular syllogism in celarent
b since in induction an universal conclusion is drawn from
o



on induction

thus by induction we may infer that all
bodies are liable to fall towards the centre of
the earth because we perceive this fact to
exist the same under similar circumstances in
all bodies upon which we make the experi
ment this inference is as dr whately very
justly observes a syllogism in barbara with
the major suppressed that being always sub
stantially the same as it asserts that what
belongs to the individual or individuals we
have examined belongs to the whole class un
der which they comeh the above example
may thus be reduced to a syllogistic form in
barbara 
example of
 that quality which is perceived to exist in many bodies is
induction 
√¢Ä¢ to
 exist
 in all
√¢Ä¢√¢ñ† √¢Äû
likely
 the liability to fall towards the centre of the earth is a
quality which is perceived to exist in many bodies 
therefore the liability to fall towards the centre of the
earth is a quality which is likely to exist in all bodies

particular facts care must be taken that these facts are suffi
ciently numerous to authorize such an inference for one fact
brought forward against the conclusion destroys the induction
whereas in the example which is spoken of below see p 
a number of facts brought against the conclusion would not
destroy the argument though they would tend to diminish the
probability of occurrence contained in that conclusion an in
ductive argument therefore unless the induction be perfect u
more easily subverted than the example but when perfect it
is the most decisive argument that can be adduced
n see dr whatelys elements of logic p 
 the great error into which induction is likely to lead us is a

on the example



it is by induction that almost all elemen
tary principles are proved indeed they do
not admit of any other mode of proof and
a perfect induction is as decisive an argument
as even demonstrable evidence thus when a
stone is thrown into the air i am as convinced
that it will fall to the ground even though i
should not see it as if it were demonstrated
to me by the most incontrovertible evidence
 the example is when from a knowledge example
that any fact has occurred we infer that the
same event will take place with respect to some
other unknown fact
there are two points in which the example difference
between exdiffers from induction
ample and
induction
√¢Ä¢ with respect to the premises for in
too great haste in drawing the conclusion viz the inferring an
universal conclusion when the facts enumerated are not suffi
cient in number to authorise such an inference in order to
make a correct induction the number of facts must be very
great and the greater the number the more perfect will be the
induction
k it is by induction that all axioms are known such as
 things that are equal to the same are equal to each other
 a whole is greater than its parts and all other mathematical
axioms whence it may be observed that induction is that
mode of argument which is adapted to the discovery of any prin
ciples or facts which are not previously known thus aristo
tle in his ethics proves by induction that all virtue consists in a
mean for he shows that this is the fact with respect to each of
the virtues which he enumerates and consequently infers the
universal conclusion with respect to them all

o



on the example

induction the facts from which we draw the
universal conclusion must be very many m
number whereas in example we may draw
our conclusion from one single fact
 with respect to the conclusion for m
induction the conclusion is universal and the
inference drawn is that the same fact will always
happen the same under similar circumstances
but in example this is by no means the case
for the conclusion does not infer the certainty
of any fact occurring in the same manner as
the one similar fact from which we draw our
conclusion but merely the probability of such
an occurrence and the degree of this probabi
lity will of course depend on the number of

 the inference drawn by example sometimes is such as pro
duces but a small degree of probability for fables similes and
allegories are comprehended under it it is called by aristotle
 oratorial induction artabanus makes use of this kind of
argument when endeavouring to dissuade xerxes from invading
greece saying that darius had failed in his expedition against
the scythians and that the grecians weie more warlike men
than the scythians consequently that his expedition would pro
bably be attended with more dangerous consequences than the
expedition of darius
this mode of argument is very frequently employed indeed
it is almost the only mode which under many circumstances it
is possible to adopt such as in contingencies which might not
admit of any positive proof in such cases it should be remem
bered that the greater the number of facts is which are adduced
in support of the subject in question the greater will be the de
gree of probability of its occurrence

on the sorites



similar facts which are adduced in order to
show that the particular fact in question will
probably occur the more facts that we can
adduce the more does the example approach
the induction and the greater degree of pro
bability will its conclusion possess
 the sorites is a number of syllogisms in sorites
which the conclusion of each is made a premiss
of the next and so on till we arrive at the
last but in the sorites these syllogisms are
not given at full length for the conclusion of
each syllogism is suppressed so that the form
of the sorites becomes a number of proposi
tions in which the predicate of each becomes
the subject of that which follows thus e g
 every good man lives in the fear of god
 every man who lives in the fear of god
is virtuous every virtuous man is con
tented every contented man is happy
therefore every good man is happy m

m a sorites is nothing more than a number of condensed syllo
gisms which may easily be expanded so as to be in the regular
form it does not require any reduction for it is already in the
first figure although it may appear to be in the fourth because
the premises are transposed thus it appears that the sorites
is really a syllogistic mode of argument whereas the enthymeme is what is called a material argument i e the conse
quence depends entirely upon the power or meaning of the
terms and may frequently lead into error see above p 
note c and aldrich chap iii 

o



on the sorites

this sorites may thus be placed in a regular
syllogistic form 
 i every man who lives in the fear of god is virtuous 
 every good man lives in the fear of g od 
therefore every good man is virtuous
 every virtuous man is contented 
 every good man is virtuous 
therefore every good man is contented
 every contented man is happy 
 every good man is contented 
therefore every good man is happy

thus it may be observed that the sorites is
a series of syllogisms in the first figure in which
the premises are transposed
only one pre hence it follows that in a sorites only one pre
miss negative
√¢£uianepar miss can be negative for in this case one of its
syllogisms would have both of its premises ne
gative neither can any more premises than
one be particular for then as before one of
its syllogisms would have both its premises
particular
prwyiiogism the prosyllogism is a proposition which

√¢∞ thus the following sorites is incorrect 
 every man is endued with the faculty of reasoning no
animal endued with this faculty is a brute no brute has the
power of speaking every being who has the power of speaking
lias also the power of communicating to others his ideas there
fore every man has the power of communicating to others his
ideas it will also be easy to show that the negative premiss
which is allowable in a sorites must be the last premiss and
the particular premiss if there be one must be theirst these
rules will be manifest by trying examples

on the pkosyllogism



is attached to one of the premises as it were
incidentally to confirm the strength of that
premiss in fact the premiss to which the prosyllogism is attached is the conclusion of an
enthymeme of which the prosyllogism itself is
the premiss e g
 every virtuous act is worthy of commendation 
√¢Ä¢ every act of charity if it proceeds from a mind ac
tuated by proper principles is a virtuous act
therefore such acts of charity are worthy of commendation

the prosyllogism is not uncommonly used sometima
used as a preinstead of that premiss of which it is the
proof and from this circumstance the syllo

√¢∞ this is frequently put into practice in order to condense
the argument the same circumstance may be frequently ob
served in the sorites where two or three prosyllogisms are some
times employed instead of their premises e g the sun is a
created thing those who worship a created thing are guilty of
idolatry those who are guilty of idolatry act under mistaken
notions therejore those who worship the sun act under mis
taken notions this sorites may easily be brought into an ac
curate syllogistic form though its present form is not strictly
regular as follows 
 those who worship a created thing are guilty of
idolatry
 those who worship the sun worship a created thing
for the sun is a created thing 
therefore those who worship the sun are guilty of idolatry
 those who are guilty of idolatry act under mistaken
notions 
 those who worship the sun are guilty of idolatry 
therefore those who worship the sun act under mistaken no
tions



on the prosyllogjsm

gism though correct would seem to have too
many terms thus in the following example
 charity covereth a multitude of sins 
 a multitude of sins is a load of evil 
therefore charity covereth a load of evil

this syllogism may at first sight appear to
be faulty because there are apparently five
terms but it may be shown to be correct thus
 that which covereth a multitude of sins covereth
a load of evil for a multitude of sins is a load of
evil
 charity covereth a multitude of sins 
therefore charity covereth a load of evil

sipprened
conclusion

thus the prosyllogism a multitude of sins
is a load of evil is substituted for the major
premiss the truth of which it was intended
to confirm
 it is a common practice to suppress the
conclusion at the end of any argument and
this is very frequently done in common con
versation as well as in argumentative writings 
for the conclusion being known from the ques
tion it would be useless to express it at the
close of every argument this practice is not
confined to opponents only but is done by all
who are engaged in discussing any subject
p the conclusion of an argument is supposed to be known by
means of the question or problem which is to be proved hence
formally to state the conclusion at the close of an argument
would be of no use and would only produce tautology
