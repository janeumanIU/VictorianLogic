outline of sematology 



introduction 
in the last chapter of lockes essay on the 
human understanding there is a threefold 
division of knowledge into uot trpaxrik 
and trtjfieiatik if we might call the whole 
body of instruction wliich acquaints ua with 
to fvttka by the name physicology and 
that which teaches to irpaktixa by the name 
practkology — all instruction for the use of 
to jato or the signs of our knowledge 
might be called sematology 

 physicology far more comprehensive than the 
sense to wliich physiology is fixed would in this case 
signify the doctrine of the nature of all things what 
ever which exist independently of the minds concep 
tion of them and of the human will which things in 
clude all whose nature we grow acquainted with by ex 
perience and can know in no other way and therefire 
include the mind and god since of the mind as well 
as of sensible things we know the nature only by ex 
perience and since abstracted from revelation we 
know the existence of a god only by experiencing his 
providence practicology the next division is the 
doctrine of human actions determined by the will to s 
preconceived end namely something beneficial to in 
dividuals or to communities or the welfare of the

introduction 



the signs which the mind makes use of 
in order to obtain and to communicate know 
ledge are chiefly words and the proper and 
skilful use of words is in different ways the 
object of grammar of logic and of 
 rhetoric our outline of sematology 
will therefore be comprised in three chap 
ters corresponding with these three di 
visions 

species at large as to sematology the third division 
it is the doctrine of signs showing how the mind ope 
rates by their means in obtaining the knowledge com 
prehended in the other divisions it includes meta 
physics when metaphysics are properly limited to 
things tb eta tct pifika i e things beyond natural 
things — things which exist not independently of the 
minds conception of them e g a line in the abstract 
or the notion of man generally for these are merely 
signs which the mind invents and uses to carry on a 
train of reasoning independently of actual existences 
e g independently of lines in concrete or of men in 
dividually and particularly but as to the class of 
signs which the former of these instances has in view 
and which are peculiar to mathematics there will be 
no necessity in this treatise to make much allusion to 
them it is to the signs indicated by the other example 
that reference will chiefly be made for these are the 
great instruments of human reason and we believe 
they have never yet had their suitable doctrine

the other poet does not on this occasion appear in 
metre but is equally merry 

 i tae it for granted that these good men are phi 
bophically correct in their account of the origin of 
language and if the scripture had left us in the dark 
upon that article i should very readily adopt their 
hypothesis for want of better information i should 
suppose for instance that man made his first effort in 
speech in the way of an interjection and that ah or 
oh being uttered with wonderful gesticulation and 
variety of attitude must have left hia powers of ex 
presdon quite exhausted that in a course of time he 
would invent many names for many things but first 
for the objects of his daily wants an apple would 
consequently be called an apple and perhaps not

growing out of those powers originally bestow 
ed on man and essential to their further deve 
lopment 

many years would elapse before the appellation would 
receive the sanction of general use in this case atid 
upon this supposition seeing one in the hand of 
another man he would exclaim with a most moving 
pathos oh apple well and good — oh apple is 
a very affecting speech but in the mean time it profits 
him nothing the man that holds it eats it and he 
goes away with oh apple in his mouth and nothing 
better reflecting on his disappointment and that 
perhaps it arose from his not being more explicit he 
contrives a term to denote his idea of transfer or 
gratuitous communication and the next occasion that 
offers of a similar kind performs his part accordingly 
his speech now stands thus — oh give apple the 
appleholder perceives himself called upon to part with 
his fruit and having satisfied his own hunger is 
perhaps not unwilling to do so but unfortunately 
there is still room for a mistake and a third person 
being present he gives the apple to him again dis 
appointed and again perceiving that his language has 
not all the precision that is requisite the orator retires 
to his study and there after much deep thinking 
conceives that the insertion of a pronoun whose office 
shall be to signify that he not only wants the apple to 
be given but given to himself will remedy all defects

s now instead of taking it for granted as 
others have done who have pursued the method 
proposed that men sat down to invent the 
parts of speech because they found they had 
ideas which respectively required them we as 
sert that men have originally no such ideas as 
correspond to the parts of speech the im 
pulse of nature is to express by some single 
sound or mixture of sounds not divisible in 
to significant parts whatever the mind is 
conscious of nor is there any thing in the na 
ture of our thoughts that leads to a different 
procedure till artificial language begins to be 

he uses it the next opportunity succeeds to a wonder 
obtains the apple and by his success such credit to 
his invention that pronouns continue to be in great 
repute ever afler now as my two syllablemongers 
bcattie and blr both agree that language was 
originally inspired and that the great variety of 
languages we find on earth at present took its rise from 
the confusion of tongues at babel i am not perfectly 
convinced that there is any just occasion to invent 
this very ingenious solution of a diieculty which 
scripture has solved already

invented or imitated let us take for our first 
fact the cry for food of a newborn infant that 
is an instinctive ciy wholly unconnected we 
presume with reason and knowledge in pro 
portion as the knowledge grows that the want 
when it occurs can be supplied the cry be 
comes rational and may at last be said to sig 
nify give me food or more at full i want 
you to give me food in what does the ra 
tional cry rational when compared with the 
instinctive cry differ from the still more ra

thus that the one is a sign suggested directly 
by nature and the other is a sign aijsing out 
of such art as in its first acquirement we are 
about to presume nature or necessity gradu 
ally teaches our species now that the arti 
ficial sign is made up of parts namely the 
words that compose the sentence and that 
the natural sign is not made up of significant 
parts we affirm to be simply a consequence of 
the constitution of artificial speech and not to 
follow from any thing in the nature of the com

munication which the mind has to make the 
natural cry if understood is for the purpose 
in view quite as good as the sentence nor 
does the sentence as a whole signify any thing 
more taking the words separately there is 
indeed much more contained in the sentence 
than in the cry namely the knowledge of 
what it is to give under other circumstances 
as well as that of giving food — oijbod un 
der other circumstances as well as that of be 
ing given to me — of me under other circumt 
btances as well as that of wanting food 
but all this knowledge in this and similar 
cases for which a cry might suffice is un 
necessary and the indivisible sign if equally 
understood for the actual purpose is for 
this purpose quite adequate to the artificially 
compounded sign 

s the truth is this that every perception 
by the senses and every conception which 



• by conception i mean that power of the mind 
which enables it to fonn a notion of an absent object of 
perception or of a sensation which it has formerly 



sect on grammar 

follows from such perception as well as every 
desire emotion and passion arising out of 
them is individual and particular and if lan 
guage had continued to be nothing more than 
an outward indication of these its passive affec 
tions it would have consisted of single indivi 
dual signs for single individual occasions like 
those which are originally prompted by na 
ture but it was impossible to find a new sign 
for every new occasion and therefore an ex 
pedient was of necessity adopted which ex 
pedient from its rudest to its most refined ope 
ration will be found one and the same — an 
expedient of reason and that through which 
all the improvements of reason are derived 
the expedient is nothing more than this — 
when a new expression is wanted two or more 
signs each of which has served a particular 
purpose are put together in such a manner as 
to modify each other and thus in their united

capacity to answer the new particular purpose 
in view in this manner words individually 
cease to be signs of our perceptions or con 
ceptions and stand individually for what are 
properly called notions that is for what the 
mind knows — collectivelif that is in sen 
tences they can signify any perception by the 
senses or conception arising from such per 
ception any desire emotion or passion — in 
short any impression which nature would 
have prompted us to signify by an indivisible 
sign if such a sign could have been found — 
but individually we repeat each word be 
longing to such sentence or to any sentence 
is not the sign of any idea whatever which the 
mind passively receives but of an abstractiont

word idea has been a cause of the widest conslon in 
other writers 

t home tookes doctrine is very different from 



sect on grammar 

wliich reason obtains by acts of comparison and 
judgment upon its passivelyreceived ideas 

tbis he says diversions of purley d edit 
vol i page that the business of the mind as 
far as regards language extends no further than to re 
ceive impressions that is to have sensations or feel 
ings — he affirms pa££im that what iscalled abstrac 
tion has no existence in the mind but belongs to lan 
guage only and that the very term metaphtsic is 
nonsense page it is hoped that what follows in 
the test will prove these opinions to be erroneous 
could the proper name john or any word being an ar 
tificial part of speech have been invented if the mind 
had not exerted its active powers upon its passively r 
ceived ideas for whatever ideas of this last kind we 
have of john must be ideas arising out of particular 
perceptions and ve must irame him to our minds 
standing or sitting or walking talking or silent 
dressed or undressed with other circumstances which 
imagination can vary but cannot set aside it is only 
by comparison that we know john to be independent 
of all these and the name is the effect of this know 
ledge not the cause of it the abstraction is not in 
the word only for till we know that jolm is separate 
abstract from whatever circumstance the perception 
of him includes how can his name exclude it neither

properly called a metaphysical notion and pure 
mathematics are justly considered a part of metaphysics 
it was because h tooke set out with these principles 
thus fiindamentally erroneous that he could not com 
plete his system when he had brought it to ail but a 
close with admirable acuteness of inquiry he had 
tracedup every part of speech till he found it originally 
either a noun or a verb and he then left his book im 
perfect because he could not on the principles he had 
started with explain the difference between these — he 
promised indeed to return to the inquiry but he never 
fiiliilled his promise for the best of reasons that there 
was no pushing it further in the way he had gone he 
must have contradicted all his early premises to have 
reached a true conclusion the whole cause of his 
error seems to havebeen a too unqualified understanding 
of lockes doctrine that the mind has no innate ideas 



sect

but neither word separately can be said to 
express a part of that perception since the 
perception is of john walkmg and if we per 
ceive john separate from walking then he is 
not walking and consequently it is another 
perception and so if we perceive walking se 
parately from john it must be that we per 
ceive somebody else walking and not him 
the separate words then do not stand for 
passively received ideas but for abstract no 
tions — so far as they express what is pec ij 
ceived by the senses they have no separate 
meaning it is only with reference to the un 
derstanding that each has a separate meaning 
the separate meaning of the word john is a 
knowledge and therefore properly called a i 
notion not an idea that john has existed and 

hence tooke acknowledges nothing originally but 
the senseb and the experience of those senses calling ¦ 
reason the effect and result of those senses and that 
experience see vol ii page 

 if indeed the word idea were uniformly employed 
to signify what is here meant by notion and nothing 
else little objection could be made such use would

ception and the separate meaning of the word 
•walks is a linowledge that another may waik as 
well as john this is not an idea of john or an 
idea of walking such as the senses give or such 
as memory revives for the senses present no 
such object as john in the abstract that is 
neither walking nor not walking nor do they 
furnish any such idea as that of •walking inde 
pendently of one who walks there is then 
a double force in these words — their separate 
force which is derived from the understanding 
and their united force by which in this in 
stance they signify a perception by the senses 

nearly correspond in effect though not in theory with 
the old platonic bcnse and in the platonic sense 
lord mooboddo constantly employs it in his work on 
the origin and progress of language but as dr 
reid observes in popular language idea signifies 
the same thing as conception apprehension to have 
kd idea of a thing is to conceive it this sense of 
the word dugald stewart adopts philos of the 
human mind vol l chap sect locke as 
already intimated uses the word in all the senses it 
will bear 



sect on grammar 

 in otlier instances the united significa 
tion of words may not be a perception of the 
senses j but whatever may be their united 
meaning they will separately include know 
ledge not expressed by the whole sentence 
though if the meaning of the sentence be ab 
stract the knowledge included in the separate 
words will be necessary to the knowledge ex 
pressed by the sentence pride offends 
is a sentence whose whole meaning is abstract 
but pride separately and offends separately 
are still more abstract and in using them to 
form the sentence we refer to knowledge be 
yond the meaning of the sentence as a whole 
namely to pride under other circumstances 
than that of offending and to offending under 
other circumstances than that of pride offend 
ing and here tlie knowledge referred to 
seems necessary in order to come at the know 
ledge expressed by the sentence john 
walks or according to our english idiom 
 john is walking is a perception by the 
senses and does not therefore depend on a

knowledge of john and of walking in the ab 
stract though to express the perception in 
this way requires it but pride offends 
does not express an individual perception nor 
would many individual perceptions of pride 
offending give the knowledge which the sen 
tence expresses we must have obsered 
what pride is separately from its offending 
and we must have observed what offending is 
separately from pride offending before we 
can rationally understand or try to make 
known to others that pride offends in this 
double force of words by which they signify 
at the same time the actual thought and re 
fer to knowledge necessary perhaps to come 
at it we shall find as we proceed the ele 
ments the true principles of logic and of 
rhetoric while in tracingthe necessity which 
obliged men to signiiy in this manner even

would have prompted them to make known

of gkammau the last mentioned subject 
must occupy our first attention 

 to get at the parts of speech on our hy

invented for art having furnished the pattern 
we now invent upon that pattern j but our 
purpose is to consider how the pattern itself 
is produced by the workings of the human 
mind on its first ideas those ideas can be 
none other than the mind passively receives 
through the senses and perhaps the first ac 
tive operation of the mind is to abstract sepa 
rate the subjects or exterior causes of sensa 
tion from the sensations themselves when 
we see we find we can touch or taste or 
smell or hear and when the perception 
through one of these senses is different we 
find a difference in one or more of the others 
we also recollect conceive our former per 
ceptions and finding the actual sensations 
not recoverable by an effort of the mind alone

we recognize the separate existence of the ma 
terial world all this is knowledge ac 
quired indeed so early in life that its com

but we are nevertheless warranted in affirm 
ing that not the least part of it is an original 
gift of nature along with this knowledge 
we acquire emotions and passions for to knoia 
material objects is to know them as causes of 
pleasurable or painful sensation and hence to 
feel for them in various degrees and with 
various modifications desire and aversion joy 
and grief hope and fear and here as the 
same object does not always produce the same 
emotion or the same emotion arise from the 
same object we begin a new class of abstrac 
tions we separate mentally the object from 
the emotion or the emotion from the object 
we are enabled in consequence to abstract and 
consider those differences in the objects from 
which the different effects arise and to ascer 
tain by trial how far they yield to volition ope 
rating by the exterior bodily members which

we have previously discovered to be subservient 
to the will in this new class of abstractions 
and the consequences which arise from them 
we shall find the beginning of that knowledge 
which human reason is privileged to obtain 
compared with that which the higher orders 
of the brute creation in common with man 
are able to reach j and from this point we 
shall be able to trace how man becomes iepoyjr 
or divider of a natural word into parts of 
speech while other animals retain unaltered 
the cries by which their desires and passions 
are first expressed 

 as we are able to separate mentally 
the object from the emotion and to remem 
ber the natural cry after the occasion that 
produced it ceases the natural cry might re 
main as a sign either of the object or of the 
emotiont but this does not carry us beyond

the mind which forms the abstraction and 
has the power to establish a sign wliether 
audible or not to fix and remember it — our 
inquiry is how a communication can be made 
from mind to mind when the signs which na 
ture furnishes are inadequate to the occasion 
and first be it observed that only such occa 
sions must at the outset be imagined as do 
but just rise above those for which the cries 
of nature are sufficient — we must not sup 
pose a necessity for communicating those ab 
stract truths which grow out of an improved 
use of language and which could not there 
fore yet have existence in the mind and 
we have further to observe that no com 
munication can be made from one mind to 
another but by means of knowledge which 
the other mind possesses — the cries of na 
ture can find their way only into a conscious 
breast — that is to say a breast that has known 



jection eignifyidg that emotiou or the n 
so placed ae to give occasion to it 



sect on grammar 

or at least can know the feelings which are 
to be communicated and is capable therefore 
of sympathy or antipathy and knowledge 
of whatever kind can be conveyed to another 
mind only by appealing to knowledge which is 
already there to suppose otherwise would 
be to attribute to human minds what has been 
imagined of pure spirits — the power of so 
mingling essences that the two have at once 
a common intelligence to human minds it 
is certain that this way of communicating is 
not given but each mind can gain knowledge 
only by comparing and judging for itself and 
to communicate it is only to suggest the sub 
jects for comparison let us suppose that a 
communication is to be made for which a na 
tural cry is not sufficient — the difficulty then 
can be met only by appealing to the know 
ledge which the mind to be informed already 
possesses the occasion will create some cry 
or tone of emotion but this we presuppose 
to be insufficient it will however be under 
stood as far as the hearers knowledge may 



 on grammar ciiap 

enable him to interpret it — that is he will 
know it to be the sign of an emotion which 
himself has felt and he will think perhaps of 
some occasion on which himself used it but 
the cry is to be taken from any former par 
ticular occasion and applied to another and 
he who has the communication to make will 
try to give it this new application by joining 
another sign such as he thinks the hearer is 
hkewise acquainted with the natural cry 
thus taking to its assistance the other sign and 
each limiting the other to the purpose in hand 
they will in their united capacity be an ex 
pression for the exigence and will to all in 
tents and purposes be a sentence 

 in some cases nature seems to furnish 
an instinctive pattern for the process here de 
scribed —a man cries out or groans with pain 
he puts his hand to the part affected and we 
at once interpret his cry more particularly 
than we could have done without the latter 
sign in other cases we are driven to the 
same process not by an instinct but by the 




sect 



on geammah 



ingenuity of reason seeking to provide that 
which nature has not furnished if a man 
unskilled in language or not using that which 
his hearers understand should try to make 
known what art expresses by a sentence such 
as i am in fear from a serpent hidden there 
his first effort would be the instinctive cry of 
fear but aware that this could be particularly 
interpreted only of a known and not of an un 
known occasion he would by an easy effiirt of 
ingenuity fix it for the present purpose by add 
ing a sign or name of the reptile for mimick 
ing the hiss of the reptile would obviously be 
a name and by joining to both these a ges 
ticulative indication of place the instinctive 
cry thus newly determined and appued is a 
sentence and however clumsy it may seem 
when compared with the more complicated 
one previously given yet the art employed is 
of the same kind in both we leave the read 
er to smile at the example as he pleases and 
will join in his smile while he compares it with 
that in the epistle of the poet in the note at

sect and if he is disposed to smile again 
we will suppose another example — two men 
going in the same direction are stopped by 
an unexpected ditch and ejaculate the na 
tural cry of surprise haha this is remem 
bered as the expression suited for that par 
ticular occasion and the mind the human 
mind seems to have the power of generalizing 
it for every similar object suppose one of 
these men finding another ditch very offensive 
to his nose signifies this sensation by screwing 
up the part offended and uttering the nasal 
interjection proper for the case — the inter 
jection may not be sufficient j for the other 
man may remain to be informed of what his 
companion knows namely that the offence 
proceeds from the ditch to fix the mean 
ing therefore of the interjection to the case 
in hand the communicator adds the former 
natural cry in order to signify the ditch and

some slight alteration in the word as ofien as 
it was used adjectively and the same all

most any substantive as an adjective as often as need

this is often done even in the present state of 
language j but the doubt whether it was to be 
taken with the substantive or the verb would 
soon produce some general difference of form 
and thus the adverb would be brought into 
being as a distinct part of speech 

 still it would often happen that in 
endeavouring to limit a verb to the particular 
communication in view no substantive or pro 
noun joined to it not even with the further 
aid of an adjective or adverb joined to the 
substantive or verb would suffice and failing 
therefore to convey the communication by 
one sentence it would become necessary to 
add another to limit or determine the significa 
tion of the first now a qualifying sentence 
thus joined when completely understood in 
connexion with that it was meant to qualify 
would be esteemed as a part of the same sen 
tence and the verb in the added sentence

would possibly then lose its force as the sign 

of a distinct communication this again will 
easily be understood by a reference to what

a verb but in this sentence all were there

sider the clause except ttie to be a distinct com 
munication but only a qualification to suit the 
whole sentence to the purpose in view we call 
except a preposition that is a word put be 



 this solution of the difficulty in the invention 
of prepositions which seems so considerable to adam 
smith is suggested as the reader will perceive by 
the etymological discoveries of home tooke and will 
receive complete confirmation by the study of his ad 
mirable work let it not be supposed however that 
we have nothing to object to in the diversions of

 it may be that the organs of sensation 
are not all fully developed in a newborn in

allow that they are so this is as much as to 
say that our earliest sensations from the ob 
jects of the material world are the same that 
they are afterwards but there must be this 
most important difference — that the early 
sensations are wilkoui knowledge and the lat

affects my sense of vision is a being like my 
self — i know him to be one of a great many 
similar beings — i know him to be older or

shorter — i know pretty nearly the distance 
he is from me — know that the particular 
circumstances under which he is now seen 
are not essential to him but that he may be 
seen under other circumstances — i know that 
what now affects my sense of hearing is the

various knowledge here spoken of is brought

possibly be capable of but as to the know 
ledge there is no reason to believe he lias the 
least portion of it for the knowledge is 
gained by experience requiring and com 
prising many individual acts of observation 
comparison and judgment j all which we 
suppose yet to take place in the newborn 
infant now in looking back to what has 
been said on the acquirement of language we 
find the effect of our progressing knowledge 
to be this that every sign arising out of a par 
ticular occasion will lose that particular re 
ference in proportion as we find it can be used 
on other occasions j and so all words will at 
last in their individual capacity become ab 
stract or general this is as true of such 
words as yellow white heat cold soft hard 
bitter sweet and the like signs of what locke 



sect on grammar 

calls simple ideas as of any other for we 
can evidently use these words on an infinity 
of different occasions j and the power of so 
using them is an effect and a proof of our 
knowing that the different occasions on which 
we use the same word have a something in 
common or in some way resemble but 
while all words thus acquire an abstract or 
general meanipg every communication which 
we purpose to make by their means must in 
comparison with their separate signification 
be particular and our putting them together 
in order to form a sign for the more particular 
thought will be to deprive them of the abstract 
or general meaning which they had indi 
vidually if this is the real nature of the 
process we are completely mistaken if we

signifies without what deceives us into this 
impression is that on considering each word 
separately each is found to have meaning 
let us try however whether the joining of 
words into a sentence does not take from them 
the meaning they have separately put to 
gether the three words my head aches 
and we have an expression namely the whole 
sentence which signifies what from a want 
of clearness in our remarks may possibly be 
the readers present particular sensation hut 
my separately signifies the general knowledge 
i have attained of what belongs to ine as dis 
tinguished from what belongs to another j a 
knowledge which is not at all necessary that 
is the •ctjcra knowledge to the sensation it 
self nor even to the expression ofit if we could 
find any single sign in lieu of the three which 
we have put together accordingly the 
word my as soon as it is joined to the other 
words drops that meaning which it had 
separately and receives a particular limitation 
from the word head which word head is like 



sect om grammar 



 



wise limited by the word rrof and the more 
particular meaning which both these receive 
by each other is limited to the particular oc 
casion by the word aches yet it may perhaps 
be thought that in this and in every other 
sentence each word as the mind suggests it 
to the lips is accompanied by the knowledge 
of its separate meaning and that in this 
manner if we use the word idea in the un 
restricted sense familiar to the readers of 
locke each word may be said to represent an 
idea without entirely denying the justice 
of this view of the matter we offer in its place 
the following statement 

 in forming a sentence for its proper 
occasion the knowledge of which each sepa 
rate word is fitted to be the sign may or 
may not be in the mind of the speaker it 
may be entirely there or only in part or not 
at all there that is to say the speaker may 
not know the separate meaning of a word 
but only the meaning it is to have in union 
with the other words and even if the 



 on grammar chap i 

speaker does know the full separate meaning 
of each word yet he is not under the neces 
sity of thinking of that separate meaning 
every time he uses it nor does he in fact 
think of the separate meaning of words while 
in putting them together his purpose is to ex 
press what has been often expressed before but 
only and even then but partially and occa 
tonally when he uses words to work out some 
conclusion not yet established in his own mind 
or when a train of argument is required to 
convince or persuade other minds this 
statement will of course require some con 
siderations in proof 

 and first as to the knowledge of 
which each separate word is fitted to the sign 
it is to be observed that our knowledge grows 
with the use of words and therefore our firet 
use of them is unaccompanied by that know 
ledge which we gain by subsequent use 
this is true whether we invent words or 
adopt those already invented in the rude 
beginning of language the first use of a word

for head would be a use of it for a particular 
occasion and the word would be particular or 
proper if the speaker used it with reference 
to himself it would signify what we now sig 
nify fay the two words my head by observ 
ation and comparison he would find he could 
extend the meaning of the word and apply it 
with reference to his neighbours as well as 
himself and it would then no longer be proper 
but common that is to say it would signify 
a human head and not mj head extending 
his observations still more widely he would ap 
ply it with reference to every other living crea 
ture and it would accordingly then signify a u 
ing creatures head looking and comparing 
still further he would apply it with referenceto 
every object in which he discovered a part 
having the same relation to the whole as the 
head of a living creature has to its remaining 
parts and the word would then and not till 
then have its present meaning that is to 

 compare the characteristics of the huron lan 
guage referred to in the note appended to sect 



on grammar 



chap 



say in a separate unlimited state it would 
signify neither my head nor a human head 
nor a living creatures head but the top 
chief part beginning supremacy of any 
thing whatever nor is the process essentially 
different in acquiring the use of words already 
invented a child does not at first put words 
together but if his head aches he will say 
perhaps head head using the single 
word in place of a sentence at length he 
will say mi head and brothers liead and 
horses head and cradles head still there 
are other applications of the word to be 
learned by use and it surely will not be 
contended that any one knows the meaning 
of a word beyond the cases to which he can 
apply it the knowledge which a separate 
word is fitted to signify may then be wholly 
or may be partly in the mind of him who 
uses it in a sentence and it is very possible 
not to be there at all a foreigner for in 
stance who had beard the phrase the head of 
the army applied to the generalinchief 



sect on grammar 

would know the meaning of the phrase but 
might be quite ignorant of the meaning of 
the separate words or even that it was com 
posed of separable words and probably most 
people can look back to a time in early life 
when they were in the habit of using many a 
phrase with a just application as a whole 
without being aware that it was reducible 
into parts in any other way than as a poly 
syllabic word is reducible 

ig but even when the speaker in form 
ing a sentence has previous possession of all 
the knowledge of which each word is sepa 
rately fitted to be the sign yet he does not in 
general think of their separate meaning while 
he is putting them together but only of the 
meaning he intends to express by the whole 
sentence for through the frequent use of 
phrases and sentences whose forms are hence 
become familiar there is scarcely any senti 
ment feehng or thought that suddenly arises 
in the mind that does not as suddenly sug 
gest an appropriate form of expression this 



chap 

is manifestly the case with such sentences as 
arc in constant use for common occasions 
these the speaker cannot be said to make 
they occur readymade and he pronounces 
the words that compose them with as little 
thought of their separate meaning as if he 
had never known them separate even when 
sentences readymade do not occur yet the 
forms of sentences will occur and the speaker 
will in general do nothing more than insert 
new words here and there till the sentence 
suits his purpose thus he who had said 
 my head aches will recollect the form of 
sentence when his shoulder aches and in 
using the sentence will only displace head 
for shoulder or if his head is giddy he 
will only displace aches for the two words 
quoted in order to say what he feels 

 when indeed we use language for 
higher occasions than the most ordinary in 
tercourse of life when by its means we pro 
secute our inquiries after truth or use it dis 
cursively as an instrument of persuasion then 



ect on grammar 

the operation itself is carried on by dwell 
ing on and enforcing the abstract mean 
ing of some of the words and some of the 
phrases whue in their progress towards form 
ing sentences as of the sentences while in 
their progress toward forming the whole ora 
tion or book but in such cases language 
may more properly be said to help others to 
come at our thoughts than to represent our 
thoughts although it is likewise true that 
we could not ourselves have come at them 
but by similar means independently of the 
words therefore the thoughts would have 
had no existence j neither should we have 
proposed the inquiry after the truths we seek 
nor have imagined any thing in other minds 
by addressing which they could be influenced 
still however in these higher uses of lan 
guage uses which are to be dwelt on more 
at full in the chapters on logic and rhe 
toric there is the same difference between 
words separately and the meaning they re 
ceive by mutual qualification and restriction

pression are parts of the expression in the 
same manner as syllables are parts of a word 
but are tol parts of the one whole meaning in 
any other way than as the instrumental means 
for reaching and for communicating that 
meaning and suppose the communication 
cannot be made but by more signs than use 
will allow to a sentence — suppose many sen 
tences are required — many sections chapters 
books — we affirm that as the communica 
tion is not made till all the words sentences 
sections c are enounced no part is to be 
considered as having its meaning separately 
but each word is to its sentence what each 
syllable is to its word each sentence to its 
section what each word is to its sentence 
each section to its chapter what each sen 
tence is to its section c thus does our 
theory apply to all the larger portions of dis 
course and to the discourse itself aristotles

definition of a word namely a sound sig 
niiicant of which no part is by itself signi 
ficant for if our theory is true the words 
of a sentence understood in their separate 
rapacity do not constitute the meaning of the 
whole sentence i e are not parts of its 
whole meaning and therefore as parts of 
that sentence they are not by themselves 
significant neither do the sentences of the 
discourse understood abstractedly constitute 
the meaning of the whole discourse and 
therefore as parts of that discourse they are 
not by themselves significant they are sig

getting at the meaning of the whole sentepce

it be asserted that the parallel does not hold 
good with regard to such words as aristotle 
has in view because of words ordinarily so 
called the parts namely the syllables are not 
significant at all while words and sentences 
which are parts of larger portions of dis 
course are admitted to be abstractedly sig 
nificant however it may be that their abstract 
meaning is distinct from the meaning they re 
ceive by mutual limitation — we deny the 
fact which is thus advanced to disprove the 
parallel we affirm that syllables are signifi 
cant which are common to many words for 
instance common prefixes as wn mis corif 
dis bi tri c and common terminations 
as nessjjul hood tion fy c j and so would 
every syllable be separately significant if it 
occurred frequently in different combinations 
and we could abstract out of such combina 
tions the least shade of something common in 
their application nor is it peculiar to syllables 
to be without signification individually the 
same thing happens to words when they are

always combined in one and the same way in 
sentences conceiving then that we are 
fully warranted in the foregoing statement we 
affirm it to be the true basis of grammar lo 
gic and rhetoric leaving the latter two 
subjects for their respective chapters we pro 
ceed in this chapter with such further proofs 
as may be necessary to confirm our position 
as far as grammar is concerned 

 we have imagined the gradual de 
velopment of all the parts of speech recog 
nized by grammarians but no reference has 
yet been made to the inflexions which some 
of them undergo nor to the diflference of 
meaning they receive in consequence of such 
inflexion nor to interchanges of duty among 
the several parts of speech nor to pecu 
liarities of use which so oflen take from them 
their characteristic differences nor to va 

 what separate meaning for instance is there 
now in the words which compose such phrases as by

riety of phrase in expressing the same mean 
ing j nor to the power which we frequently 
exercise of making the same communication 
by one or by several sentences nor in 
short to the multitude of refinements which 
grow out of an improving use of language 
many of which seem to confound and destroy 
the definitions we obtain from the first and 
simplest forms of speech all these seeming 
irregularities will however find a ready key 
in the general principles we have ascertained 
for our general principles are these i that 
two or more words joined together in order 
to receive by means of each other a more 
particular meaning are with respect to that 
meaning inseparable j since if separated 
they severally express a general meaning not 
included in the more particular one hence 
it follows that words may as easdy receive a 
more particular meaning by some change of 
form as by having other words added to 
them nay it seems more natural when the 
principle is considered to give them a more

particular meaninjj by a change of form than 
fay any other way — ii that a word is tliis or 
that part of speech only from the office it 
fulfils in making up a sentence from this 
principle it follows that a word is liable to 
lose its characteristic difference as often as it 
changes the nature of its relation to other 
words in a sentence and it also follows that 
every now and then a word may be used ia 

lome capacity wliich makes it difficult to be 
assigned to any of the received classes of 
words — iii that since the parts of which a 
sentence is composed denote general know 
ledge distinct from the more particular mean 
ing of the whole sentence it may be possible i 
to work our way to a particular conclusion 
either in reasoning for ourselves or in per j 
auading others by putting such words to 
gether as form a sentence that as a whole 
expresses the particular conclusion but that 
when from the length of the process this 
cannot be accomplished in a single sentence 
we shall be obliged to work our way by many

sentences whicli will bear the same relation 
to the conclusion implied by them as a whole 
as the parts of each sentence bear to what 
the sentence expresses from this principle 
it follows that using many or fewer sentences 
to arrive at the same result will frequently 
be optional the examination of these se 
veral consequences a httle more in detail 
with reference to the principles from which i 
they flow will complete the chapter 

 it is well known that the inflexions 
which nouns verba and kindred words are 
liable to in many languages are comparatively 
unknown in english the end being for the 
most part attained by additions in the shape 
of distinct words thus the particular re 
lation of the word marcus to the other words 
in the sentence which in latin is made 
known by altering the word into marco is 
signified in english by the word io and to 
marcusy esteeming the two words as one ex 
pression is the same as marco so likewise 
the word amo which in english signifies

being changed into amabit which in english 
is to be signified by he mil love the three 
words taken as a whole being the same as 
the single latin word shall we call to mar 
cus the dative case of afarcus and he will 
love the third person singular of the future 
tense of love as marco and amabit are re 
spectively called with reference to marcus 
and amo or shall we parse resolve into 
grammatical parts those english sentences 
and so deny in our language a dative case and 
a future tense it is evident that this is a 
question which only the elementary grammar 
writer is concerned with he may suit his own 
convenience and contend the point as he i 
pleases thus much is certain and is quite 
sufficient for our purpose — that to marcus 
cannot be considered a dative case nor he wiu 
love a future tense on any other principle than 
the one it is stated to flow from namely 
that marked i in sect

venience the continuing a word under its 
usual denomination when its office and con

he will love taking the three words as one 
expression are a verb both on the principles 
we have ascertained and in the practice of 
the elementary grammarian but in parsing 
tliis verb — this piio dictum communication 
 sentence — only one of the three words 
can properly retain the denomination of verb 
viz that word to which the others have a re 
ference by which they hang together and 
are signified to be a sentence namely ¦will 
as to the word love which the practical 
grammarian will tell us is a verb in the infi 
nitive mood it does not in fact fulfil the 
office of a verb but of a substantive but if 
by calling it a verb in the infinitive mood its 
character for practical purposes is con 
veniently marked we may fairly leave the 
matter as it stands all we insist upon is 
that the doubtful character of the word is a

himself to the perception of what it is by laying down 
the principle already animadverted upon in a note ap

priuciple would be if it could have any consequence 
at all that the first invented elements of speech were 
nouns or names for those impressions which accord 
ingly seems to be his notion and that verba afterwards 
arose from nouns by assuming the difierential some 
thing that was found to be wanting our doctrine is 
that the original element of speech contained both the 
artificial noun and the artiiicial verb that the mind 
exerted its active powers in order to evolve the artir 
ficial parts that the act of joining them together

st it might also perhaps admit of dis 
pute whether substantives in what are called 
their oblique cases do not by being the ad 
juncts to other words and taking a change 
of form to signify their servitude cease in 
fact to be substantives and merit no higher 
name than adjectives or adverbs but here 
again we consult convenience by using the 
descriptive title a substantive in the geni 
tive dative accusative or ablative case we 
only need insist as philosophical inquirers 
that the definition of a substantive in sect 
 is not less correct because it does not in 
clude a substantive in these oblique cases 

iain made them a verb but if the title was given to 
one more than to the other it was given to that which 
arose most immediately from the occasion and took 
the other to fis or determine it and that subsequently 
that word in a sentence came to be coneidcred the 
verb which joined the parts kether and signified 
them to be a sentence 

 the only oblique case in english substantives 
is the genitive terminating in fi or having only the 
apostrophe the s being elided grammarians in 
deed have found it necessary to allow an accusative 



sect on grammar g 

 the very doubt itself which so often 
arises whether a word is this or that part of 
speech — the varying classification of the parts 
of speech by different grammarians — are cir 
cumstances entirely favourable to the theory 
advanced and adverse to any theory which 
attempts to explain the parts of speech by a 
reference to the nature of our thoughts in 
dependently of language for if the parts of 
speech had taken their origin from this cause 

because pronouns have it for if in the sentence cas 
siua loved him we put the noun where the pronoun 
stands and say casmus loved brutus it seems con 
venient to consider the noun to be in the same case 
that the pronoun was in on the same principle the 
substantives which in the classical languages have no 
accusative distinct from the nominative are neverthe 
less considered to have an accusative because lite 
other substantives they can be used objectively with 
regard to verbs active and certain prepositions on 
the score of convenienee this must be allowed but 
when words are taken separately and this by 
the very delinttion of the word is the business of 
parsing it is evident that only those substantives 
are strictly speaking in the accusative case which 
when uaed as just staled have a form to signify it 



on grammar 



chap 



surely we could never have been in doubt 
either as to vskat or koio many they were 
but our theory accounts at once for the in 
certitude on these and many other points 
we admit no original element of speech but 
the verb or that one sign which denotes what 
the speaker wishes to communicate if no 
one sign can be found adequate to the occa 
sion then we must make up a sign out of two 
or more now the division of a verb into 
these parts of speech is necessarily attended 
by the consequence that each part is insigni 
ficant of a communication by itself and that 
they signify it only by being joined together 
supposing a sentence never consisted but of 
two parts the mere act of joining them to 
gether would be sufficient to signify that 
they were a sentence or verb but the ne 
cessity or usage of speech being such that 
the hearer knows a sentence may consist of 
two or of many words how is he to be warned 
that a sentence is formed unless to certain 
words is given the power of signifying a sen 



sect on grammar g 

tence while to other words this power is de 
nied until associated with a word of the for 
mer class hence the distinction between 
noun and verb a distinction arising out of 
the necessities of speech and not out of the 
nature of our thoughts the noun and the 
verb then are the original parts of speech the 
verb beingthepreviouselementof both but 
as each derives its office and character solely 
from an understanding between the speaker 
and the hearer a change of understanding 
may make them change their offices and so 
the verb shall sometimes be a noun and the 
noun a verb these changes occur in fact 
so frequently as to require no example 
then as we have seen a noun will frequently 
be used as the adjunct of another noun and 
so become an adjective j an adjective or other 
word may be joined to a verb and so become 
an adverb j and any of these by frequent use 
in particular combinations may acquire or 
seem to acquire a new and peculiar office 
and so become articles prepositions and con

best make it known by using the two sen

a suiecient proof by itself that thoughts and 
words have not the kind of correspondence

the same words yet by words of similar mean

the more propriety in instituting tlie compa 
rison because men were driven to the latter 
expedient by a necessity similar to that which 
drove them to the former for no doubt 
the first idea of the inventors of writing was 
to appropriate a character for every word and 
we are told that to this day a practice near 
to this prevails in china but it was soon 
found that the immense number of characters 
this would require must make the completion 
of the design next to impracticable and the 
expedient was at length adopted of spelling 
words by this expedient twenty four cha 
racters by their endless varieties of position 
with each other are capable of signifying the 
multitude of words and the innumerable sen 
tences which constitute speech the parts 
of speech were set on foot by a similar urgency 
and in tlie same way at first every sound 
was a sentence but the communications 
which the business of life required far far 
outnumbered every possible variety of sound 
it was fortunate therefore when a necessity 



eo

arose to give to some of the sounds a less par 
ticular application for then the requisite sign 
was formed out of two or more sounds already 
in use and no new sound was required so 
far the parallel holds but it will go no further 
in the spelling of words by letters the same 
letters must always be used — if not the same 
characters yet characters of the same power 
and it would have been the same in spelling 
a thought by words if the process had been 
what it is commonly supposed to be — that is 
to say the same thought would always have 
been expressed by the same words or if 
the words had been changed the change 
must have been word for word as in a 
completely literal translation from one lan 
guage to another how different this is

the chapter harris the author of hermes 
in treating of connectives stumbles unawares 
on the fact that a word which is significant 
when alone may he no significant part of 
what is meant hy the expression it helps to 
form he makes nothing indeed of the fact 
further than to lay himself open to the ridicule 
of home tooke for tke inconsistent assertions 
in which it involves him having says 
tooke defined a word to he a sound sig 
nificant he viz harris now defines a pre 
position to be a word devoid of signification 
and a few pages after he says prepositions 
commonly transfuse something of their own 
meaning into the words with which they are 
compounded now if i agree with him 
continues tooke that words aie sounds 
significant how can i agree that there are 
sorts of words devoid of signification and if 
i could suppose that prepositions are devoid 
of signification how could i afterwards allow

that they transfuse something of their own 
meaning yet with all this harris is right 
only that he is not aware of the principle 
which lies at the bottom of his own doctriue 
a preposition as well as every other word 
is a sound significant j — it has an independent 
abstract signification but being joined into a 
sentence it is devoid of that signification it 
had when alone it has then transfused its 
own meaning into the word with which it is 
compounded as that word has transfused its 
meaning into the preposition — that is to say 
they have but one meaning between them 

 but dugaid stewart in his philoso 
phical essays furnishes a direct and a more 
satisfactory authority in favour of the theory 
we have advanced in reading says he • 
 the enunciation of a preposition we are apt 
to fancy that for every word contained in it 
there is an idea presented to the understand

admits of such transpositions in the arrange

the artificial structure of the discourse 
suspends in a great measure our conjectures 
about the sense till at the close of the

to this the former words and phrases resemble 
those detached and unmeaning patches of 
different colours which compose what op 
ticians call an anamorphosis while the effect 
of the verb at the end may be compared to 
that of the mirror by which the anamorphosis 
is reformed and which combines these appa

working without media it can no more ope

mind can however invent the means to assist 
its operations as it has invented the telescope 
to assist the eye the difference being that 
the telescope is not such an instrument as all

assist its operations grows out of the human 
mind by its very constitution and the influ

our comparisdu in the previous section this is as if any 
one had proposed to teach the right use of the eye it 
is true indeed a man may be taught a right use of the 
eye — that is he may be taught to observe proper ob 
jects by its means and so may he be taught a right 
use of reason by applying it to those things which are 
conducive to his improvement and happiness but all 
this belongs to morals not to logic nor was this 
wattss meaning he imagined a man could be tattght 
how to use his reason independently of any considera 
tion of an instrument to work with as if any one had 
offered to teach mankind how to sec with their eyes 
now there is nothing preposterous in offering to show 
how a telescope is to be used in order to assist the 
eye nor any thing preposterous in trying to show 
how words may be used in a better manner than com 
mon custom instructs us in order to assist the 
mind — be it observed that the objection here made 
is to what was proposed to be done by watts and not

to teach us that which every one does with 
out teaching and which no teaching can 
make us do better but if by the use of signs 
the mind can carry its natural operations to 
things which it could not reach without signs 
the instruction of the logician should at once 
begin by pointing out the use and the abuse 
of signs now this is in fact the point at 
which every teacher of logic does begin how 
ever he may disguise the real proceeding from 
himself and whatever confusion he may throw 
over his subject by not knowing in what way 
he is concerned with it in pretending to 
teach us the nature of ideas j logicians do no

that perception judgment and reasoning

in question but if the theory we have before

trine will appear by the manner in which it ex 
emplifies these acts of the mind to have com 
pletely confounded what really takes place in 
the preparation for and in the exercise of this 
art what in the first place is perception but a 
sensation or sensations from exterior objects 
accompanied by a judgment our earliest 
sensations are unaccompanied by any judg 
ment upon them for we must have ma 
terials to compare in order to judge and 
these materials in the earliest period of our 
existence are yet to be collected at length 
we can compare j and because we can com 
pare we judge and hence we come to know 
— i know that the object which now affects 
my sense of vision is a being like myself i

and the word or phrase in a detached state 
does not stand for a perception or concep 
tion inclusive only of an act of judgment

of a medium — in other words a rational 
conclusion for in all cases what gives the 
name and character of rational to a proceed 
ing is the use of means to gain the end in

men that one is taller than the other al 
though the judgment we form may be an 
eect of reason yet we do not describe it as 
a rational process but if the investigator 



sect on logic 

not being able to make a direct comparison 
between them introduces a medium and by 
its means infers that one is taller than the 
other then we say the conclusion has been 
obtained by a process of reason so in 
applying a common name to two individuals 
that are intuitively perceived to resemble 
we may be said to exert the judgment and 
nothing more but if we apply it to a third 
and a fourth and a fifth it is a proof that we 
measure each by the common qualities ob 
served in the first two and that we carry in 
the mind a sign of those common qualities 
whether the name or one of the former in 
dividuals for the purpose of carrying on the

— when he does not perceive him he is reminded of 
his absence by some change in his sensations — smcu 
for instance as well as sight and perhaps some 
others he therefore seeks him and irets if he cannot 
find him but abstracted from all perception and

 it appears then from what precedes 
that words and phrases which writers on 
logic give as examples of perception or 
simple apprehension distinct from judg 
ment and from reasoning are no examples 
at all of the first distinct irom the latter two 
and equally groundless will appear that dis 
tinction which refers a proposition to an act 
of judgment separate from reasoning not 
that an act of reasoning takes place whenever 
a proposition or sentence is uttered for as 
we have seen in the previous chapter sect 
 a speaker does not always think of the 
separate meaning of the words when he utters 
a sentence and if a sentence denotes as a 
whole some sensation or emotion not de 
pendent on reason for instance my head 
aches • my eyes are delighted the ut 
tering of it as a whole without attending to 
the sqiarate words will no moje express aa 



from all notice by change of sensation it will scarcely 
be contended that a dog knows of his master as a ra

act of reasoning or even of judgment than 
would a natural ejaculation arising out of the 
occasion and used in place of the sentence 
but the following propositions plato was a 
philosopher no man is innocent which 
are given in wattss logic as examples of the 
act of the mind called judgment stand on a 
different footing and we affirm that being 
used logically they involve not an act of 
judgment merely but express a conclusion 
drawn from acts of reasoning 

 previously to shewing what has just 
been asserted let us distinguish a grammati 
cal and an historical understanding of these 
sentences for a mere grammatical under 
standing of them must be and an historical 
may be essentially different from the logical 
understanding of them a grammatical un 
derstanding for example of the sentence 
plato was a philosopher is merely a recog 
nition of its correctness as a form of speech 
without considering whether it conveys any 
meaning or not and it would be grammati 



sect 



 



cally understood if any words whatever were 
substituted for those that compose the sen 
tence provided they had a proper syntactical 
agreement an historical understanding im 
plies some concern with the meaning of the 
sentence but this may be very different in 
kind and degree as depending on the know 
ledge whicli the mind is previously possessed 
of if the hearer did not know what plato waa 
previously to the communication but knew the 
meaning of the word philosopher he would 
by the sentence be informed what he was if 
he previously knew from history how plato 
lived thought and acted but did not know 
the meaning of the term philosopher the ad 
ditional information conveyed to him by the 
sentence would be but little he would be in 
formed indeed that he was called a philoso 
pher but why or wherefore he could for the 
present only guess let us suppose however 
that before he comes to calculate why plato is 
called a philosopher he had heard the word 
plied to others if he bad heard socrates 



m 



chap ii 



called a philosopher and confucius a philo 
sopher he would on hearing plato so called 
compafe the individuals in order to ascertain 
some common qualities in all of which the 
word might be the sign and getting these 
he would know or have a notion of the word 
philosopher though the notion would pro 
bably undergo many modifications as otlier 
individuals solomon seneca locke rous 
seau newton were successively subjected to 
the common sign — for if the hearer fixes his 
notion at once many individuals will perhaps 
be excluded from his class of philosophers 
which other people include under that term 
and perhaps he will include many which the 
usage of the term excludes in this way 
then while our knowledge of what is included 
in separate words or phrases is imperfect we 
may nevertheless have some understanding of 
the sentences we hear or read and this his 
torical understanding suggests the reasoning 
process just described by which we get a 
logical understanding of the separate words 



sect 



 



 but now to make a logical use of 
tfaem in framing a proposition we suppose 
the preliminary steps namely the knowledge 
included in the separate words we suppose 
it to be known from history how plato lived 
thought and acted we suppose it to be 
known what is meant by philosopfier by 
having heard the word applied to many indi 
viduals i but we have not yet applied it to 
plato in other words we have yet to ascer 
tain whether plato belongs to the class of in 
dividuals denominated philosophers writers 
on logic talk of a comparison of ideas for 
this purpose and of an intuition or judgment 
but this to say the best of it is an imperfect 
and bungled account of the matter if in 
deed to know how plato lived and acted can 
be called an idea it is necessary to have this 
idea it is further necessary to have a clear 
notion of the term philosopher — if this again 
can be called an idea — and it is true enough 
that in comparing plato with this sign we 
judge or know their agreement intuitively 



am 



on logic 



chap 



but out of this intuitive judgment an infer 
ence arises and the sentence expresses that 
inference a comparison has been instituted 
through the intervention of a medium in 
order to ascertain whether plato is to be as 
signed to a certain class of individuals we 
intuitively perceive his agreement with the 
medium and draw or pronounce our infer 
ence accordingly — plato was a philoso 
pher nor is this the splitting of a hair 
but a real distinction marked and determined 
by that difference in the words so often 
pointed out when understood detachedly 
and when understood as a sentence the 
proposition plalu was a pjiilosopher may be 
understood as a whole without making the 
comparison in the mind between what plato 
and what philosopher abstractedly signify j 
but this with a full understanding of the 
whole sentence can be done only after the 
comparison has once at least been effectually 
made — then indeed when the comparison 
has been made and the inference drawn the 



ect 



 



sentence which expresses that inference be 
comes like any single word the sign of 
¦knowledge deposited in the mind and like 
such single term it is fitted to be an instru 
ment of new comparisons and further con 
clusions 

 let us now take another proposition 
 a philosopher or every philosopher for 
the meaning is the same is deserving of 
respect this hke the other is an infer 
ence from a comparison which took place in 
the mind previously to which comparison 
the notion or knowledge included in the word i 
philosopher was obtained in the manner lately 
described sect and the notion included 
in the phrase to be deserving of respect was 
similarly obtained but independently of the 
knowledge denoted by the other expression 
— that is to say the phrase deserving of re 
spect was originally we suppose a sentence 
applied to some one thing deserving of re 
spect j whence it was successively applied to 
other things till a class was formed — in other 



b on logic chap u 

words till a notion knowledge was esta 
blished in the mind of what things are de 
serving of respect now the present ques 
tion is whether a philosopher is deserving of 
respect to determine this we consider 
what a philosopher is it is presupposed tliat 
we have this knowledge and we then niea 
bure our notion of a philosopher with our no 
tion of what is deserving of respect and thus 
£nd that a philosopher is to be admitted 
among the things to which we had been ac 
customed to apply the designation deserving 
qf respect that is to say we come to the 
conclusion that a philosopher is deserving of 
respect here therefore as before there has 
been a reasoning process previously to the 
proposition and the proposition expresses the 
inference from it and the comparison 
having once been made in this instance as in 
the other the sentence becomes like any 
single term the sign of knowledge deposited 
in the mind and like such single term is 
fitted to be an instrument of new compsrisons 



sect on logic 

and further conclusions well then we know 
from reasoning these two things that plato 
ib a philosopher and that a philosopher is 
deserving of respect these are detached 
words or sentences but the mind in com 
paring them at once comes to the inference 
that plato is deserving of respect and the 
whole may be expressed in one sentence 
thus plato who is a philosopher is deserv 
ing of respect j where platowhoisapjiiio 
sopher is equivalent to a nounsubstantive in 
the construction of the whole sentence and 
deservingqfrespect is equivalent to another 
and thus the two with the assistance of the 
verb which signifies them to be a sentence 
are but one proposition here as in the 
former cases a comparison has been made ij 
means of the signs of deposited knowledge 
for we knew that plato was a phuosopher 
we knew a class of things or persons deserv 
ing of respect — comparing our knowledge by 

• see the second note aristotles definition of a 
vord bcuig the first appmded to sect chap i 



 on logic chap ir 

means of the sign deservingofrespect the in 
ference follows that plato who is a philo 
sopher is deserving of respect and the 
comparison having once been made in this 
instance as in the others the sentence be 
comes like any single terra the sign of know 
ledge deposited in the mind and either in 
this or any other equivalent form is fitted to 
be an instrument of new comparisons and 
further conclusions and in this manner are 
we able ad infinitum to investigate new 
truths by means of those already ascertained 
always making use of former words or their 
equivalents as the means of operation 

 now so far as logic is the art of in 
vestigating truth and we intend to show that 
its office ought not to be considered of further 
extent this is the whole of its theory we 
have defined it as the right use of words with 
a view to the investigation of truth and the 
way in which words are used for the purpose 
is that which has been described — in brief 
they are used by the mind in making such 



sect of logic 

comparisons as it cannot make intuitively of 
two objects or of a sensation or emotion 
twcie experienced we can intuitively judge 
what there is in common between them 
l suppose a third object or a sensation c 
thrice experienced an intuitive judgment can 
still be applied only to two at a time and wei 
can but know in this way what there is 
common to every two but if we set up tf 
sign of what is common to two we can compare 
with the sign a third and a fourth and a 
fifth and judging intuitively how far it agrees 
with the sign we infer its agreement in thq 
same proportion with the things signified 
in logic the sign used is always presumed 
to be a word now in our theory of ian 
guage every word was once a sentence and 
every sentence which does not express the 
full communication intended but is qualified 
by another sentence or becomes a clause of a 
larger sentence is precisely of the nature of 
any single word making part of a sentence

from the first moment then of converting 
the expression used for a particular communi 
cation into an abstract sign of the sentiment 
or truth which that communication conveyed 
the mind came into possession of the instru 
mental means for furthering its knowledge 
and this means always remains the same in 
kind and is always used in the same way 
the word which once signified a present par 
ticular perception ceased through the ne 
cessities of language to signify that percep 
tion in particular and came to signify in the 
abstract any perception of the same kind or 
the object of any such perception in this 
state it no longer communicated what the 
mind felt thought or discovered at the 
moment but was a sign of knowledge gather 
ed by comparisons on the past by ung this 
bign the mind was able to pursue its inves 
tigations and every new discovery was de 
noted by a sentence which the sign helped to 
form its general application being limited to 
the particular purpose by other signs but if

one word 



 may lose its particular pnrpose 
and become an abstract sign so may another 
and be the means in its turn of prosecuting 
further truths and entering into the com

comparison being made with the help and 
the advantage of our previous knowledge 
the reasoning takes place in the mind in such 
a manner that it is not a comparison of terms 
but a comparison of what we newly observe 
with what we previously knew words indeed 
are used because without signs of one kind 
or of another to keep before the mind the 
knowledge already gained we could compare 
only individuals j but however words may in 
tervene it is always understood that the mind 
at bottom compares the things a man 
may be informed that plato who is a phi

 william who is recommended to his service 
is an honest man that • a particular tree 
in his garden is a mulberry tree that 
 stealing is a vice and temperance is a 
virtue that throughout the universe all 
greater bodies attract the smaller that a 
triangle described within two circles in such 
a manner that one of its sides is a radius of

respectively is an equilateral triangle — a 
man may be informed of these and similar 
things and may entirely believe the inform 
ation nay hemayjustifiably believe it j for he 
may know of those who give it that their ho 
nesty is such that they would not wilfully de 
ceive him that their intelligence and inform 
ation are such that they are not likely to say 
what they do not know to be true but a man 
can be said to know these things of his own 
knowledge and in this way to be convinced 
of their truth only by a process of reasoning 
that musl take place within his own mind a 
process which can take place only in a mind 
by nature competent to it and which requires 
in every case its proper data or facts aided 
it is true by language or by signs such as ian 
guage consists of to register each inference 
• the necessity of language as a means of in 
vestigation applies not to our last example the mincl 
may investigate though no one can demonstrate 
mathematical truths with no other aid than visible 
diagrams or even diagrams that are seen only by 
 the minds eye 



 on logic chap ii 

and so to get from one inference to another 
and thus ad infinitum toward truth be 
cause the several steps leach of which is a 
conclusion so far attained cannot take place 
without the instrumentality of signs to assist 
the mind we consider the process an art and 
if the signs used are words the art is pro 
perly called logic but whatever aid the 
reasoner may borrow from words the only 
true grounds of his knowledge are the facts 
about which the reasoning is employed 
without them no comparison of the terms 
can force any conviction further than that 
the terms agree or disagree he may be told 
that — every philosopher is deserving of 
respect and that — plato is a philosopher 
but if he knows not what a philosopher is or 
what it is to be deserving of respect the 
comparison of the terms in order to draw a 
conclusion from them will be a mockery of 
reason — it will be reasoning indeed but 
reasoning without a rational end and suppose 
the knowledge to have been acquired of what 
a philosopher is by the application of the word 



sect on logia 

to many particulars and by a consequent 
classification of them in the mind — supposing 
the knowledge of what is deserving of respect 
to have been acquired in the same way — 
supposing the inquirer has learned from history 
what plato was in his opinions and manner of 
life — the conclusion takes place by a com 
parison of the thingsj by means indeed of 
words but not by any comparison of the terms 
independently of the things nor is the con 
viction in the least fortified or the process ex 
plained by a demonstration that in reasoning 
with the terms alone independently of their 
meaning we get at the conclusion — by 
shewing for instance that the terms which 
include the facts may be forced into cor 
respondence with the following nwwfa

this way of drawing a conclusion from a 
comparison of terms is properly speaking to 
reason or argue with words but in the lo 
gic we have ascertained every conclusion is 
required to be drawn from a comparison of 
the facts which the case furnishes and words 
being used only for the purpose of registering 
our conclusions such logic is properly de 
fined the art of reasoning by means of words 
the inquirer who seeks to know of his own 
knowledge— whether william who is re 
commended to his service is an honest man 
— will gather facts of williams conduct by 
his own observation and these he will com 
pare by the light of his previous notion i e 
knowledge of what an honest man is but 
then he must have that previous notion or he 
cannot make the comparison and the notion 
will have been gained by a process just like 
that he is pursuing and so downwards to the 
original comparison of individiial tjujigs from 
which all knowledge begins so again if an 
inquirer seeks to know that a particular tree 



sect on logic 

is a mulberry tree — he must first know 
what a mulberry tree is and how can he 
know this but by a comparison of different 
trees there must be some art employed to 
classify the individual trees otherwisehe could 
never know more than the difference between 
every two trees by setting up one tree or 
some equivalent sign as a word to denote 
the common qualities observed in many he 
comes to know what a mulberry tree is and 
looking at the particular tree in question he 
sees that it has the common qualities indica 
ted by the sign and infers that it is a mul 
berry tree so likewise if an inquirer seeks 
to be convinced that steaung is a vice 
or that temperance is a virtue — he 
must have such facts before him as will 
enable him to come to a clear conclusion as 
to what is vice and what is virtue and 
this conclusion will either include or ex 
clude stealing with respect to his notion 
of vice and temperance with respect to his 
notion of virtue and he will consequently be 



 



chap i 



convinceti or not convinced of tlie proposition 
in question so once more if an inquirer 
desires to know of his own knowledge 
 whether throughout the universe all 
greater bodies attract the smaller — he must 
first observe certain facts from which the ge 
neral law may be assumed hypothetical ly — 
he must then ascertain what according to 
other notions gained from experience would 
be the effect throughout the universe of the 
general law which he has so assumed and if 
the effects arising out of the hypothesis cor 
respond with actual effects and no other by 
pothesis to account for them can be framed 
he will have all the proof the subject permits 
and know of his own knowledge as far as can 
be known the conclusion asserted so lastly 
if an inquirer seeks to be convinced that a 
triangle described within two circles in such 
a manner that one of its sides is a radius of 
both and the others radii of each circle re 
spectively is an equilateral triangle — he 
must first form within his mind the notions of 



sect on logici ts 

a triangle and of a circle the latter of which he 
will find can be conceived perfect in no other 
way than in correspondence with this definition 
— a plane figure bounded by one line called 
the circumference and is such that all straight 
lines called radii drawn from a certain 
point within it to the circumference are equal 
to one another having formed this notionr 
he will find by certain acts of comparison 
which must take place within the mind al 
though they may be attsisted by a visible signj 
that the previous proposition is an inevitable 
consequence of the notfon so formed and his 
conviction wiu be comffiete if the convic 
tion in the previous ifrstances has not the 
same force as iiti the last — if in those instances 
the force may be diffident m degree while in 
the last there can be no codvictioa short of 
lliat which is absolute an entire the cause 
in not that the reasoning process is different 
in kind but that the facts or data about which 
it is employed are diiret in the last in

tions which admit uf being so defined that 
every mind capable of the reasoning at 
once assumes them before the reasoning pro 
cess begins but in the other instances the 
facts or the notions may be attended by cause 
for doubt a man if he have any notion of 
a philosopher at all cannot indeed but be 
quite sure consciously sure of his own no 
tion of a philosopher j but how can he be sure 
that others have the same notion or even 
quite sure that plato had the qualities that 
conform to his own notion in the same 
way he will be quite sure consciously sure 
of his own notion of an honest man but he 
may be deceived as to the facts which bring 
william within that notion he will be quite 
sure consciously sure of the notion he has 
in naming a tree a mulberry tree but that 
notion may be totally unlike the notion which 
other people entertain or if the general no 
tion agrees he may mistake the characteristics 
in the particular instance he will be quite 
sure consciously sure of his own notion of 



sect 



 



vice or of virtue and whether it includes or 
excludes this or that conduct action habit 
or quahtjr and in this case the conviction is 
absolute and entire while the reasoner confines 
himself to his own notion but the moment 
he steps out of this and begins to inquire 
whether it agrees with that of others he finds 
cause to doubt he must be quite sure sen 
sibly sure that bodies near above the earths 
surface have a tendency towards it and by 
proper experiments he may convince himself 
that all bodies without exception which are 
so situated have the same tendency in sup 
posing the fact universal of the tendency of 
smaller bodies to the greater his conviction 
of the consequences involved in that hypo 
thesis must as soon as he has mentally traced 
them be absolute and entire but he has yet to 
find whether reality corresponds with the hy 
pothesis the strongest proof of this will 
be the correspondence of the consequences of 
the hypothesis with the phenomena of na 
ture joined to the impossibility of forming

another hypothesis which shall account for 
these phenomena and the doubt if any 
will attach to that impossibility and to the 
accuracy of bis observatioda of the pheno 
rneoa i then there is roonr for doubt and 
cociseaently for various degrees of assent in 
all the instances except m that whose facts or

scribing the constitution of a rational mind— 
they are identical with the capacity itself for 
reasoning to view them in any other light is 
to mistake a circumlocution for the discovery 
of a principle and this kind of mistake 
every one labours under who supposes that 
by any means whatever an act of reasoning 
is assisted or explained accounted for or con 
firmed nothing is more certain than that if 
two terijns agree with a third they agree with 
each other — if one agrees and the other dis 
agrees they disagree with each other but 
every other act of reasoning has a conclusion

an act of reasoning is conversant being the 
sole cause of any doubt in the conclusion

amount to the placing of one such act by the 
side of another as if any one should set a 
pair of legs in motion by the side of another 
pair and call it an explanation of the act of 
walking such would at once appear to be 
the character of the aristotelian syllogism 
were it not for the complicated apparatus ac

and rules rendered necessary by the nature of 
the terms compared for these terms being 
obtained by the division of a sentence are 
such that they agree or disagree with each 
other only in the sense they bore before the 
division took place our theory makes this 
plain for it shows that words which form a 
sentence limit and determine each other and 
thus have a different meaning from tliat which 
belongs to them when understood abstracted 
ly therefore though it may be true that 
 plato is a man deserving of respect 
does not follow that plato and a maai 
deserving of respect shall agree togetiier as 
abstract terms accordingly the latter term

understood abstractedly signifies any or every 
man deseiving of respect and does not agree 
with plato it must be obvious then that 
terms obtained iirthis way can be compared 
with other terms similarly obtained only un 
der the safeguard of certain rules such rules 
are accordingly provided and tliat they may 
not want the appearance of scientific general 
ization and simplicity they are all referred to 
one common principle — the celebrated dic 
tum de omni et de nullo whose purport is 
that what is affirmed or denied of the whole 
genus may be affirmed or denied of every 
species or individual under it — which indeed 
is nothing more than a verbal generalization 
of such a fact as this that what is true of every 
philosopher is true of any one philosopher

versal principle do but leave us just where we

tain them an ultimalefact an act of reason 
ing is the natural working of a rational mind 
upon the objects whatever they may be which 
are placed before it when having formed one 
judgment intuitively it makes use of the re 
sult as the medium for reaching another and 
the pretence to assist or explain this operation 
by the introduction of such an instrument as 
the syllogism is an imposition on the under 
standing 

 this will more plainly appear when we 
examine the real use if use it can be called 
of the aristotelian art of reasoning it may 
be described as the art of arguing unreason 
ably or of gaining a victory in argument 
without convincing the understanding as 
it reasons with words and not merely by 
means of words it fixes on expressions not on 
things and is satisfied with proving a conse 
quence or exposing a nonsequitur in those 
without inquiring into the actual notions of 
the speaker do you admit says a syllogi 
zer that every philosopher is deserving of

respect i do says the nonsyllogi

have heard you call him by the name that 
voltaire is a philosopher you admit there

now if the notion of the respondent is that 
voltaire is not deserving of respect here is a 
victory gained over him in spite of his con 
viction arguing from the words and allow 
ing no appeal from them when once conceded 
the conclusion is decisive but in looking 
beyond the words to the things intended we 
shall find that the respondent either did not 
mean every philosoplier as a metaphysical 
but only as a moral universal or else and the 
supposition is the more likely of the two that 
in calling voltaire a philosopher he called

him so according to the custom of others and 
not according to his own notion in a logic 
whose object is truth and not victory the 
business would not therefore end here an 
attempt would be made to change the notion 
of the respondent supposing it to be wrong 
by an appeal to things his mind might in 
deed be so choked with prejudice as to be in 
capable of the truth but at least would the 
only way have been taken to remove the one 
and procure admission for the other — to the 
foregoing let another kind of example be add 
ed every rational agent is accountable 
brutes are not rational agents therefore they 
are not accountable non sequitur 
cries the aristotelian respondent the other 
man who reasons by means of words and not 
merely mth words is certain that the internal 
process by which he reached the conclusion is 
correct nor is he persuaded to the contrary

that his mode of reasoning finds a parallel in

would never bring him to such a conclusion 
as the last all this time while the aristo 
telian has the triumph of having at least 
puzzled his uninitiated opponent the real 
cause of diflference is kept out of sight name 
ly that the one refers to that reasoning which 
is conducted merely with words and not by 
means of words only while the other refers to 
that reasoning which looks to things inatten 
tive perhaps as in this instance to the expres

therefore they are not accountable • — the as

the speaker is charged with having been guilty 
of that violation when in fact he has not at 
tempted to reason syllogistically at all i e to 
draw his conclusion from a comparison of the 
extremes with the middle but from a judg 
ment on the facts of the case in a logic

words and not by the artifice we have just 
referred to an expression which does not

certainty rests solely on the condition that 
words are so taken every conclusion from

allusion was made to the fact that men do 
not see truly by nature but acquire through 
judgment and experience the power of know 
ing by sight the tangible qualities of objects 
and their relative distances now the in 
terference of rules supposing them possible 
to assist this early discipline of the eye would 
be useless — perhaps raiscliievous — why are 
we to think differently of the discipline of the 
mind as regards the use of those signs which 
if our theory is true are forced upon us at 
first by an inevitable necessity because the 
art of seeing truly is necessary to the preserva 
tion of the individual and nature takes care 
therefore that we do not teach ourselves im 
pertectly or erroneously but the conducting

who is left to improve his physical and moral 
condition has the instrument of that improve 
ment confided to his own care that he may 
add to its powers and form for himself rules 
for using it with much more precision and 
much more effect than any random use of it 
can be attended with accordingly if we 
look to that department of knowledge which 
locke calls ipvaik we shall find that it owes 
its existence to the accurate logic by which 
inquirers registered all their observations and 
all their experiments and by which they as 
cended from individuals to classes till each 
had comprehended in his scheme all he de 
sired to consider here then begins the pro

if something may yet be done toward im 
proving these methods it should open the 
way to such improvement the aristotelian 
rules for definition which are a sound part of 
logic should be explained and illustrated 
and the nomenclatures invented by various 
philosophers particularly that which is used

every individual conducts ¦within his avra

that is false which at the outset we take for

perniciously ruinously erroneous it is ac

it should be the business of the politician to 
examine the principles on which the general

never been the logic of mankind at large

which yield to persuasion as theie are other

plication of the term persuasion to the one set 
and of conviction to the other is in many cases 
arbitrary rather than dictated by a corre

finding a truth and the proving it to others 
ought to be assigned to different departments

 in the chapter just finished it was shown 
that the use of language as a logical instru 
ment entirely agrees with the theory of gram 
mar we ascertained in the first chapter and 
that on no other principles than those which 
arise from that theory can logic be pro 
fitably studied we have now to show that 
the use of language as a rhetorical instrument 
agrees with the same theory and that the 
view of the art hence obtained lays open its 
true nature and the proper basis for its rules

which in the first chapter we started with 
may be called the rhetoric of nature to

which language is significant all words 
whatever not excepting even proper names 
express notions knowledge obtained from 
the observation and comparison of many par

has reference to the particulars from which 
the knowledge has been gained but it is by 
degrees we reach the knowledge of which 
each single word is fitted to be the sign we 
begin by understanding those sentences or 
single words understood as sentences that 
signify our most obvious affections and wants 
and which taking the place of our natural 
cries retain the tone of those cries as far as 
the articulate sounds they are united with 
permit in all cases as a sentence expresses 

 vide chap ii sect ad fincm 



sect on rhetoric 

a particular meaning in comparison with the 
general terms of which it is composed the 
hearer may be competent to the meaning of 
the sentence who is not competent to the 
full meaning of the separate words a cry 
a gesture may deprecate evil or supplicate 
good and a sentence which takes the place 
of or accompanies that cry or gesture will 
as a whole be quickly interpreted but the 
speaker and the hearer must have made con 
siderable progress in the acquirement of know 
ledge by means of language before the one 
can put together and the other can separate 
understand such words as a fellow 
creature implores a friend entreats 

it is by frequently hearing the same word in 
context with others that a full knowledge of 
its meaning is at length obtained but this 
implies that the several occasions on which it

plies in short a constant enlargement of our 
knowledge by the use of language as an in 
strument to attain it 

 but he who uses language as a logical 
will also use it when need requires as a rhe 
torical instrument the rhetoric of nature 
the inarticulate cries of the mere animal he 
will lay aside or at least he will employ them 
and he will then do so instinctively only on 
tliose occasions for which they are still best 
suited — for the expression of feelings re 
quiring immediate sympathy on all other 
occasions he will use the rhetoric by which 
a mind endowed with knowledge may expect 
to influence minds that are similarly endowed 
and our inquiry now is how the effect is pro 
duced— how by means of words taking 
words to be nothing else than our theory of 
language has ascertained them to be — how 
by such means we inform convince and 
persuade 

 according to our theory wobds are to

be considered as having a double capacity 
in the first as expressing the speakers actual 
thought — in the second as being the signs 
of knowledge obtained by antecedent acts of 
judgment and deposited in the mind which 
signs are fitted to be the means of reaching 
further knowledge now when we use lan 
guage as a rhetorical instrument we use it 
or at least pretend to use it in order to make 
known our actual thought — in order that 
other minds should have that information or 
be enlightened by that conviction which we 
have reached could this be done by a single 
indivisible word — could we realize the wish 
of the poet —

in our power rhetoric would be a natural 
faculty not an art and our inquiry into 
its means of operation would be idle but 
getting beyond the occasions for which the 
rhetoric of nature is sufficient and for which 
those sentences are sufficient that serve the 
most ordinary purposes of life an instan 
taneous communication from mind to mind is 
impossible the information the conviction 
or the sensitive associations which we have 
wrought out by the exercise of our observing 
and reasoning powers can be given to another 
mind only by giving it the means to work out 
the same results for itself and as a rhetorical 
instrument language is in truth much more 
used to explore the minds of those who are 
addressed than to represent by an expression 
of correspondent unity the thought of the 
speaker — rather to put other minds into a 
certain posture or train of thinking than pre 
tending to convey at once what the speaker 
thinks contrary as this doctrine will ap 
peir to common opinion on the subject a very 



ect on rhetoric 

little reflection will show that it must be true 
for a word can communicate to another mind 
what is in the speakers only by having the 
same meaning in the hearers but if it have 
the same meaning then it signifies no more 
than what the hearer knows already or what 
he has previously experienced and this is 
plainly the case with sentences words in 
familiar use which signify what all have at 
times occasion to express which are used 
over and over again for their respective pur 
poses and of which while uttering or hearing 
them we do not attend to the meaning of the 
separate words but only to the meaning of 
the whole expression here it is confessed 
the communication is made at once but then 
it is a communication which the hearer is pre 
pared to receive because he has himself used 
the same expression for the same purpose

the conviction is altogether strange to the

speaker will seek in vain as in the first case 
for an expression previously familiar to the 
hearer and he will have to form an expres 
sion but how shall he form it as words 
have the power of representing only what is 
known on both sides he must form it not 
with signs of what is to be made known but 
of what is already known in this way he 
may produce an expression — whether that 
expression take the name of sentence oration

notes that which his mind has been labouring 
to communicate — the information the con 
viction or the sensitive associations he is de 
sirous that others should entertain in common 
with himself the necessity of so protracted 
so artful a process must be set down to the 
hearers account not to the speakers the 
latter is or ought to be in previous possession 
of what he seeks to communicate — he has 
been through the process and reached the 
result but that result he cannot give at once

and gratuitously to others he can but lead 
them to it as he himself was led by address 
ing what they already know or feel and his 
skill in rhetoric will be the skill with which 
for this purpose he explores their minds it 
will be a process of synthesis on his part and 
of analysis on theirs he will form an ex 
pression out of words which signify what 
they already know or what they have already 
felt and the separate understanding of these 
on their part will enable them to understand 
his expression as a whole this being the 
theory of rhetoric which grows out of our 
theory of language we now proceed to show 
that the actual practice of every speaker and 
of every writer is in accordance with it 

 to begin with description and narra 
tion — is it not obvious that to procure in 
another mind the idea of things unknown we 
proceed by raising the conception of those 
that are known an object of sight which 
the party addressed has never seen we give 
an idea of by allusions made iu various ways 



 on rhetoric chap iii 

to objects he has seen — or if being new as a 
whole it is made up of parts not new we give 
the idea of the whole by naming the parts 
and their manner of union an unknown 
sound or combination of sounds an unknown 
taste smell or feel is suggested to another 
mind by a comparison direct or indirect 
with a known sound taste smell c as to 
conceptions purely intellectual it is a proof 
how little one mind can directly represent or 
open itself to another that in the first in 
stance such conceptions can be made known 
not by words that directly stand for them not 
by comparisons with things of their own 
nature but only by comparisons with affec 
tions and effects outwardly perceptible as 
would at once be obvious in tracing to their 
origin all words that relate to the faculties and 
operations of the mind y although it is true

of the objects of comparison that once in

 thus then when we make use of 
words in order to inform we produce the 
effect by adapting them to what the hearer 
already knows in using words in order to 
convince and persuade we produce the effect 
in the same way but to convince it is ne 
cessary to inform — to acquaint the hearer 
either with something he did not know before 
or with something he did not attend to and 
the information is called the argument or 
proof thus the information that plato was 
a philosopher is an argument or proof that 
he is deserving of respect and the clear 
testimony that a man has killed another 
maliciously proves that the perpetrator is 
guilty of murder but why do we account 
the information in the respective instances an 
argument or proof of the conclusion for 

iieautifully fiimple is tilled with alluaions to things 
which the least philosophy will teach us they could not 
be acquainted with 

 the word argument is commonly used iii the 
sense we here assign to it though it is likewise often 
used with more coniprelicnbivc meaning 



 on rhetoric cuap iii 

no other reason than this that it is addressed 
to a notion knowledge previously acquired 
of what persons are deserving of respect in 
the first instance and of what constitutes the 
crime of murder in the second instance 
take away this previous knowledge and the 
information remains indeed and may perhaps 
be clearly understood but in neither instance 
can it lead the hearer to the conclusion — 
that is to say it will not then be an argument 
for the end in view it will communicate 
perhaps what it professes to make known but 
there the matter will end in every process 
then by which we propose to convince others 
of a truth there are three things implied or 
expressed i that which we intend to prove 
true and which if stated first is called the 
proposition if last the conclusion ii the in 
formation by which we try to prove it and 
which is accordingly called the argument or 
proof iii the previous notion knowledge to 
which the information is addressed and 
which is frequently called the datum being 



sect on rhetoric 

that which is presumed to be already known 
and therefore conceded or given by the person 
reasoned with on account of which and 
solely on this account the information is 
offered in the capacity of an argument or 
proof now here we have the parts of a 
syllogism though in reversed order viz the 
conclusion the minor the major and this 
may serve to show without having recourse 
to the aristotelian doctrine of the comparison 
of a middle with extremes why the form of a 
syllogism where necessary must always be a 
forcible way of stating an argument for 
first we state that which our hearer cannot 
but concede j major then we state that 
which he did not know or attend to in such 
a way that he must receive it on our testi 
mony or admit as evident as soon as it is 
attended toj minor and these two being 
admitted they are found to contain what we 
proposed to prove which we then draw 
from them without the possibility of a rational 
contradiction conclusion for example 

o 



 on rhetoric chap iii 

our hearer knows by experience what persons 
are deserving of respect he knows then 
that 

 every philosopher is deserving of respect 

we then remind him of the fact which he has 
learned from history that 

 plato is a philosopher 

hence on his own knowledge we advance 
the undeniable conclusion 

 plato is deserving of respect 

is this conclusion at all fortified — is the 
process which led to it explained — by shew 
ing that a comparison of the terms independ 
ently of the things produces the proposition 
which expresses it both the hearer and the 
speaker must have the knowledgevfyiicyi the first 
two propositions refer to or the conclusion can 
not be drawn for any rational end and if they 
have the knowledge they have the conclusion 
in that knowledge in convincing the hearer 
the speaker does nothing but remind him 
that he the hearer has the necessary know 



sect on rhetoric 

ledge and the syllogism we admit puts the 
matter home in a very forcible way but that 
is all another form of speaking will oflen do 
equally well for instance plato who is a 
philosopher is deserving of respect whether 
the truth is stated in this way or in the for 
mer way or in any other way the extract 
ing of a middle and extremes out of the ex 
pression and demonstrating that these agree 
or disagree is we repeat it a puerile addition 
to the process that has previously taken place 
again with regard to the other example at 
the beginning of the section — our hearer 
knows suppose him to be a juryman either 
of his own knowledge or by the definition 
laid down by the judge that 

 maliciously killing a man is murder 

this is the datum or major he receives in 
charge i e he is informed that a b killed a 
man maliciously which is tantamount to 
saying that 

 what a b did is killing a man maliciously 

o 



 on rhetoric chap ill 

this information is to be the argument or 
minor by which the conclusion is to be esta 
blished but the juryman must be made sure 
of its truth — he must know it — before he 
can receive it in this capacity — well he is 
made sure of its truth — must he then go to 
aristotle and be taught to compare the 
middle with the extremes in order to pro 
nounce his verdict that 

 what a b did is murder 

that is he is guilty of murder will he be 
more satisfied with his own verdict if he is 
able to do so common sense pronounces 
no let us then for ever have done with 
the aristotelian syllogism admitting how 
ever in favour of the form of expression that 
to express i the datum — ii the inform 
ation which because it is addressed to the da 
tum is an argument— and iii the conclusion 
from them — in three distinct propositions is a 
very forcible way of stating a truth which we 
have reason to believe our hearer is prepared 



sect on rhetoric 

to admit the moment it is so stated but 
the syllogism thus detached from the artifice 
of comparing a middle with extremes is only 
one among the innumerable ways of express 
ing a truth which the custom of language 
permits and is no more the invention of 
aristotle in particular than any of those 
other forms that might be used instead 
of it 

 this brief notice of the syllogism in 
addition to what was advanced in the last 
chapter occurs by the way — the point we 
had in hand was to show that in convincing 
others by means of words we adapt our words 
to what they already know and this must 
be evident from what has preceded for we 
previously proved that in order to inform 

 our observations on the syllogism are not meant 
to call in question the intellectual capacity of the in 
ventor for what we conceive to be a just estimate 
of his merits we refer to dugald stewarts second 
vol of the philos of the human mind chap iii 
sect near the middle of the section 



 



on rhetoric chap iii 



we adapt our words to what our hearers al 
ready know and we have just shown that the 
process of convincing them is a process in 
which we address some information to a pre 
existing notion let us now see how this 
doctrine tallies with the terras of art which 
are already in recognised use and as occa 
sion may offer let us inquire if there be any 
difference and what between conviction and 
persuasion 

 that every argument used to influence 
others is considered to derive its efficacy 
from some preexisting notion opinion or rul 
ing motive whether permanent or transitory 
in the hearer is evident from the following 
and similar expressions argumentum ad judi 
cium by which we signify that our inform 
ation is addressed to such general principles of 
judgment as mankind at large are guided by 
argumentum ad hominem by which we imply 
that we address those peculiar principles by 
which the individual man is actuated again 
argumentum ad vtrvcundiam argumentum ad 



sect 



on rhetoric 



ignorantiam argumentum ad jidem argumcn 
tum ad passiones all imply arguments infoim 
ation addressed to some partial motives of 
judgment and action and in all these the 
conclusion arising out of the reasoning has 
the same validity as far as regards the mere 
act of reasoning it is the difference of the 
data that makes it of very different value a 
conclusion from an argument addressed to 
principles which all men recognise is obvious 
ly a conclusion of universal force but one 
which arises from an argument addressed to 
peculiar principles can of course be convinc 
ing only to such as admit those principles 
so likewise a conclusion which arises from the 
reverence entertained for the author of the 
principles professed — or which follows in the 
hearers mind from his limited notions and 
would not follow if he were better inlorra

cases the argument is valid and therefore ef 
fective with respect to the minds for which it 
is adapted but addressed to other and more 
general motives or knowledge it may be no 
argument at all here then we may 
perhaps see how the difference arises between 
conviction and persuasion — mere persuasion 
is conviction as far as it goes but it is con

persuaded is conscious that the reasoning 
process itself is right but he suspects —

conclusions which flow from them we may 
moreover observe that the truths a speaker 
has in view do not always stand in need of 
demonstration they are perhaps admitted al

object of an argument will then be to awaken 
those sensibilities and with this effect its pur

of mieerable man his life decays 
like that fair flower that with the suns uprise 
its bud unfolds and with the evening dies 

here the argument is obviously meant for 
persuasion there may at the same time be 
an ultimate truth in view which the speaker 
designs to enforce when he has prepared the 
mind for receiving it and he will then employ 
arguments of a different kind and address 
them to notions of universal dominion — but 
with regard to any of the arguments which 
in this brief review we have glanced at —

nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas move the

indeed are perfect cheats and therefore however 
laudable or allowable oratory may rehder them in ha

all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct wholly 
to be avoided and where truth and knowledge are con

the language or the person that makes use of them

the former he can touch the chords or awaken

account for with much ingenuity namely 
that nonsense so often escapes being detect

is distinct from the other now suppose a 
succession of words to have no connected

meaning which is as much as to say suppose 
them to be nonsense yet in their separate 
capacity they will nevertheless stand for 
things that have been known and felt and 
if both the speaker and the hearer shbuld be 
satisfied with the vague revival of this know 
ledge and of these feelings they will neither 
of them seek for and consequently will not 
detect the absence of an ulterior purpose 
the effect which is produced by words thus 
used or rather misused extends no further 
than that produced by instrumental music 
and is of the same kind for no one will 
pretend that a piece of niusic expresses or can 
express independently of words a series of ra 
tional propositions yet it awakens some sen 
timents or feelings of a suflsciently definite cha 
racter to occupy the mind agreeably now 
perhaps it is not an unwarrantable libel on 
one half of the reading world if we affirm 
that they read poetry and other amusing 
composition for no further end and with no 
further effect than the pleasure of such vague

sentiments or feelings as spring from music 
and to such readers it is of little moment 
whether the words make sense or not ac 
cordingly when composition like the follow

though incongruous notions in words gram 
matically united agreeably jingled and having 
a connexion probably with certain sensitive 
associations they are liable to read on not

into a holy transport and dismiss them as

this effect which is apt to be attributed to 
hypocrisy because the ordinary notions of 
language suggest no cause for it our theory 
explains with no heavy scandal to the parties 

 concerning the elements of rhetoric 
ranged under the divisions of invention and 
elocution we have now made what remarks 



 on rhetoric chap iii 

our object required there yet remains one 
division namely pronunciation which will 
however scarcely furnish occasion for extend 
ing our observations since our theory is not 
in any peculiar manner concerned with it 
as we started with the rhetoric of nature 
namely tone looks and gesture so we are at 

 disposition and memory are in general adde 
to these three omnis oratoris vis ac facnltas 
says cicero in quinque partes est distributa ut 
deberet reperire primum quid diceret deinde in 
venta non solum ordire sed etiam momento quodam 
atque judicio dispensare atque componere tiun ea de 
nique vestire atque omare oratione post memoria 
sepire ad extremum agere cum dignitate et venustate 
de orat as to two of these divisions we have 
no occasion to notice them because there is nothing 
in our theory of language which requires them to be 
viewed in a new or peculiar light — we may take oc 
casion to observe before concluding the note that the 
modem use of the term elocution assigns it to sig 
nify what the ancients denoted by pronunciation or 
action and dr whately sanctions this modem sense 
by adopting it in his rhetoric we have used it 
in the foregoing page in the ancient sense quam 
graeci faaiv vocant says quinctilian latine 
dicimus elocutionem ins viii 



sect on rhetoric 

once ready to admit that these may and 
ought to accompany the language of art — 
that they ought not to be absent even from 
the recollection of him who writes lest 
his style be deficient in vivacity in union 
with these parts of pronunciation is that ele 
ment of artificial oral speech called empha 
sis and it will be to our purpose to observe 
how very inadequate are the common notions 
of language to account for the actual practice 
of emphasis as it may be observed in english 
speech the common view of words that 
make up a sentence is that they respectively 
correspond to ideas that make up the thought 
and therefore in a written sentence if we 
would know the emphatic word we are de 
sired to consider which word expresses the 
most important idea thus when dr 

 to this end some teacher of elocution elocution 
in the modem sense somewhere says if in every 
assemblage of objects some appear more worthy of no 
tice than others if in every assemblage of ideas 
which arc pictures of those objects the same difference 



 on rhetoric chap iii 

johnson was asked how we ought to pro 
nounce the commandment thou shalt not 
bear false witness against thy neighbour he 
gave as his opinion that not should have the 
emphasis because it seemed the most im 
portant word to the whole sense but garrick 
influenced by no assumed theory pronounced 
according to the practice of english speech 
 thou shaltnot bear c there is in fact 
no other rule than custom in english speech 
for the accenting of words in a sentence any 
more than there is for accenting syllables in a 
word a peculiar or referential meaning 
may indeed disturb the usual accent of a 

prevail — it consequently must follow that in every 
assemblage of words which are pictures of these ideas 
there must be some that claim the distinction called 
emphasis all this ingenious parallel with aristotles 
authority to back it we affirm to be purely visionary 
and we hope the reader by this time thinks as we do 
yet is the passage in entire accordance with the no 
tions of language that commonly — nay it should 
seem universally prevail 

 the story is somewhere related by boswell 



sect on nhetortic 

word for instance the common accent of 
the word forve will be displaced if the 
word is pronounced referentially to a word 
that has a syllable in common as in saying 
to give and lojdrgive and just so will it be 
in a sentence which is pronounced refer 
entially to an antecedent or a subsequent 
sentence either expressed or understood 
which would be the case if we pronounced tie 
ninth commandment in contradiction to one 
who had said thou shaltbear false witness 
c for then we should accent it in johnsons 
way and say thou shalt nt bear c 
now this is what is properly called emphasis 
namely some peculiar way of accenting a 
sentence in order to give it a referential mean 
ing a sentence pronounced to have a plain 
meaning has its customary accents but no 
emphasis the commonest example will be 
the best and therefore we will quote one 
that may be found in every book in which 
emphasis is treated of do you ride to 
town today if this is pronounced with 




• on rhetoric chap hi 

out allusive meaning ride town and day 
are equally accented by the custom of the 
language and there is no emphasis properly 
so called which by the way is a pronun 
ciation of the sentence that teachers of read 
ing in their search after its possible oblique 
meanings forget to tell us of suppose we 
give an emphasis to ride then lidetotoivnto 
day will be allusive to ¦wdlktotowntoday as 
we might accent the word intrinsical in the 
mauner marked with a reference to the word 
extrinsical although the plain accentuation is 
intrinsical so again tolotvnloday is allusive 
to thecountrytoday and totowntoddy is al 
lusive to totowntomrrow as the word 
powerless might be accented on the last syl 
lable with a view to poweiiful that the ac 
tual practice of emphasis corresponds with 
this account the reader may satisfy himself 
by observing the conversation of the well 
bred — not their reading for that is oflen 
conducted on mistaken principles — and we 
scarcely need point out how completely this 



sect on rhetoiuc 

practice accords with our theory of language 
for with us a sentence is a word not more 
resolvabie into parts that constitute its whole 
meaning than a word made up of syllables 
and as with regard to a word of the latter de 
scription the accent is determined to one syl 
lable by custom but is disturbed and placed 
on another syllable in making allusion to 
another word having syllables in common 
so with regard to a sentence word made up 
of words the accents are likewise determined 
to certain words that usually bear ihem but 
these accents are disturbed and placed on 
other words in making allusion to a meaning 
which has orwhich if expressed would have 
words in common and here with this new 
kind of proof in favour of our theory and 
with the last subject usually treated of in 
rhetoric we might stop the hand that has 
traced this outhne but there remain a few 
remarks that could not be introduced earlier 
for which the patience of the reader is en 
treated a little longer 




 on rhetoric chap iii 

 we may take the liberty in the first 
place to observe that with regard to the 
materials of sematology which have been con 
sidered our theory leaves them what they 
were it pretends only to show the true basis 
on which they stand and that the learned 
distribution of them is not that which accords 
with the actual practice of mankind suppose 
then if we may suppose so much that our 
grammars our books of logic and our in 
stitutes of rhetoric are to be altered in con 
formity with the views which have been 
opened the changes will not affect the detail 
but the general preliminary doctrine and the 
subsequent arrangement as to doctrine 
the changes will mostly consist of omissions 
in grammar if we omit the common de 
finitions of the parts of speech and allow 

 god help the poor children that are set to learn 
these and other of the definitions in elementary 
grammars particularly english grammars for the

it will certainly be mucli more instructive to distinguish 
them by the definitions and an accurate knowledge of

iredicate that which is asserted of that person or 
thing matth gr § to state our objections

the author or translator may define a propositici or 
what they may mean by the principal ideas in it

the two operations of the mind perception

because those operations do not take place

expresses a conclusion from a rational process 
as eftectually as a syllogism and if we further 
omit and the omission is important whatever 
is peculiar to aristotelian logic — all that 
remains will on the principles we have had 
before us be essentially useful to the learner 
namely the precepts for accurate definition 
the precepts against the assumption of un

merely by means of words the precepts for 
guarding against being led away by true con

data which data with their conclusions are 
kept out of sight by the art of the speaker or 
the blindness of the inquirer in rhetoric 
there is less to be omitted than in the other 
branches but in this department the general 
views we have opened are important because 
they exhibit the art in connexion with a great

for as rhetoric is an instrumental art we 
are told that it ought to be considered ab 
stractedly from the ends which the speaker 
or writer may propose in using it j and 
quinctilian who insists that the orator that 
is of course the consummate orator must be 
a virtuous man lias been classed with those 
whom atraihevffla and axaiovela have betrayed 
ioto a wrong estimate of the art as we 
think the good old roman schoolmaster is 
not quite beside the mark in his notion on 
this point we propose to inquire wliether 
the placing of rhetoric on the basis we have 
ascertained does not lead to the position he 
so stoutly maintains now the immediate 
basis of rhetoric is logic and our remarks 
will therefore begin with the latter 

 logic as well as rhetoric is an in 
strumental art but if our definition is correct 
it is an instrument for the discovery of truth 
and it is then only perfect as an instrument 
when it is completely adapted to that end 
• see whatelys rhetoric introductiun

a great and worthy end is therefore essential 
to logic and a correspondent effect will 
appear in those who have made a skilful use 
of it but the logic we speak of is that 
which is applied to things namely to physicot 
and practica that is to say which is em 
ployed to ascertain the constitution of the 
world in which we uve and of ourselves who 
live in it and thence to deduce what we 
ought to do — but the examination of the 
world and of ourselves and of our duties is 
the examination of particulars and our logic 
has recourse to universals for no other purpose 
than to understand particulars the better if 
there is a logic which resting in universals 
confers the power of talking learnedly and 
wisely yet leaves a man to act the part of an 
ignoramus and a fool in the commonest 
concerns of life this is not the logic we have 
had in view there is indeed a learned ig

of learning there is also an ignorance from

would not walk into it but he does not

may be an habitual incapacity of judgment

occasional insanity of judgment from the in

reckoned and the precepts which warn us of 
them are among the most important of those 
which belong to praclica in the mean

to object the actual characters of those who 
speak and write for they may be pretenders 
in rhetoric j or their advance in it though 
real may be very inconsiderable toward the 
perfection we are supposing but it may be 
said that the assumption begs the question 
and leaves us still to show that the office of ¦ 
leading men to truth is essential to rhetoric 
in contradiction to those who view it as a mere 
instrument equally fitted for the purposes of 
truth and falsehood now it must be con 
fessed with regard to the means employed in 
rhetoric that they frequently seem adapted 
to the prejudices of men — to meet rather than 
to oppose their ignorance and their passions 
and if there were any way of conveying truth 
at once into minds unfitted to receive it the 



 it is a comiuoii thing to say of a person that he 
vtiu not be convinced the fact generally stands 
thus we use arguments that convince ourselves and 
presume they are fitted to convince him not knowing 
or not observing that all argument derives its force 
om the previous knowledge in the mind to which it 
is addressed and that our hearer may have been so 






 on rhetoric cmap iii 

use of such means would be conclusive against 
an honest purpose in the speaker but the 
instantaneous communication of truth is un 
der most circumstances impossible and there 
fore we may next ask what interest a writer 
or speaker can have in an ultimate purpose to 
deceive the answer will be — to serve one 
or other of those partial purposes of which 
the common business of life whether we look 
into its private circles or into the forum or 
senate house furnishes hourly examples but 
may we not describe all this as a conflict in

true that our hearer mill not be convinced — thai is 
to say does not wish to be convinced because his par 
ty perhaps or his profession or the career be it what 
it may into which he has entered does not agree witli 
what is sought to be established let us in candour 
consider in such a case what a vantage ground we oc 
cupy inasmuch as we see our own interest temporal 
or eterual coupled with the proposition in view and 
let us condescend by the argumeittum ad homhiem 
to give him a similar advante before we expect his 
conviction from the argumentum ad judicium

truth as suits the present purpose and to veil 
the rest and will not the whole of truth be 
shown in this manner as far at least as men

the palm of eloquence is permanently his alone

genuine logic enlarges the empire of truth 
will the necessity appear of seeking in an en 
lightened mind and a heart kindled by active 
philanthropy for the true springs of elo 
quence thus will ambition be brought to 
side with virtue because there will be no 
way of winning distinction but by cultivating 
the powers of language in subservience to 
that knowledge which gives a man the de

and governing himself 

 to conclude — the theory which in 
this treatise we have endeavoured to establiah 
is this — that we come at all our knowledge 
by the use of media which media are chiefly 
words and that as the words procure the 
notions the notions exist not antecedently to 
language —that when by these means we 
have gained knowledge and try by similar 
means to communicate it to others we do 
not while the process is going on represent 
our own thoughts but we set their minds a 
thinking iu a particular train that our own

thought represented by nothing short of 
the completely formed word whose parts if 
any or all of them are separately dwelt upon 
are not parts of our thought but signs of 
knowledge which we and our hearers possess 
in common and which by bringing their 
minds into a particular attitude enables them 
to conceive our thought when the whde 
word that expresses it is formed — that i§ 
before this word is formed there are parts by 
which something is communicated not known 
before yet being communicated it is still 
but a part of the means toward knowing 
something not yet communicated and stiu 
therefore the principle holds good that we 
are adding part to part of the whole word 
which is to express something not yet com 
municated which word even though it ex 
tend to an oration a treatise a poem c is 
as completely indivisible with respect to the 
meaning conveyed by it as a whole as is a 
word which consists only of a single syllable 
or a single sound if this doctrine truly de 
scribes the nature of the connexion between 



 on rhetoric chap iii 

thought and language we claim for it the 
merit of a discovery because the common 
theory that is the theory which men are 
presumed to act upon and to which all pre 
ceptive works are adapted — not the theory 
which unawares they really act upon — ex 
hibits that connexion in a very different light 
and as a discovery we are the more dis 
posed to urge attention to it because our 
soundest metaphysicians have expressed them 
selves as if there ooas something to be dis 
covered as regards the connexion we speak of 
before a system of logic could be establisiied 
on a just foundation locke says that when 
he first began his discourse on the under 
standing and a good while after he thought 
that no consideration of language was at all 
necessary to it at the end of his second 
book he discovers however so close a con 
nexion between words and knowledge that 
he is obliged to alter his first plan and having 
reached his concluding chapter he speaks as

raent of reason dugald stewart too from 
whom in the conclusion of our first chapter 
we quoted a passage which entirely agrees so 
far as it goes with the views we have opened 

 has the following remark in his last work the 
third volume of the philosophy of the human 

 mind if a system of rational logic should 
ever be executed by a competent hand this 
viz language as an instrument of thought 
 will form the most important chapter 
our doctrine is that this will not merely form 
the most important chapter but that it wtu 
be the only chapter strictly belonging to jjo i 
c and yet the theory we offer keeps deaf 
of the extreme which betrayed home tooke 
who appears to consider reason as the result 
of language we pretend then to have inade 
the discovery which locke felt to be necessary 
and the nature of which stewart more than i 
conjectured j but oura is only i outline 
and the system of rational logic which the 
scotch metaphysician speaks of yet remains to 
be executed by a competent hand — we

pretend but to have ascertained for it the 
true foundation — something might be add 
ed on the importance which the subject de 
rives from the aspect of the times for the 
most careless observer cannot but remark 
how the rapid communication of knowledge 
from mind to mind moulds and forms public 
opinion and how the opinion of the many ac 
quiring day by day a character and a weight 
that never distinguished it before threatens to 
become the law to which not only individuals 
but governments and eventually the common 
wealth of nations must conform and hence we 
might be led to urge that philosophy cannot 
be employed more opportunely than in a new 
examination of the instrument by which so 
much has been and so much more is likely 
to he effected the consideration is how 
ever too obvious not to have occurred to the 
reader and we therefore close our remarks

refines upon that use of language in which the logic 
of mankind at large consiets 

the doctrine of the whole work may receive some 
light from the following way of stating it — man in 
common with other animals derives immediately from 
nature the power to express hie immediate or as they 
are commonly called his natural wants and feelings 
but he also possesses the power of inventing or learn 
ing a language which nature does not teach and it is 
solely by the exertion of this power which we call 
reason that he raises himself above the level of other 
animals by media such as artificial language consists 
of and only by such media he acquires the knowledge 
which distinguishes him from other creatures and 
each advance being but the step to another he is a 
being indefinitely improveable but if words are the 
means of knowledge it is an error to describe or con 
sider them in any other light and we accordingly 
deem them not as strictly speaking the signs of 
thought but as the means by which we think and set 
others a thinking this principle being admitted ren 
ders unnecessary lockes doctrine of ideas and se 
matology stands opposed to and takes the place of 
what the french call iuealogy
