preface 



i have ventured to offer this small work to the 
public with the view of accomplishing two objects 
first to endeavour to impress upon the readers at 
tention the constituted differences of evidence which 
exist in the various departments of human know 
ledge to which the higher kinds of reasoning are ap 
plied and secondly to avoid as much as possible 
those crabbed and technical words and phrases so 
profusely scattered over most of our elementary as 
well as popular treatises on logic 

the first object that of pointing out the differ 
ences in the evidence on which various subjects rest 
must be allowed by all to be an important one 
many errors in judgment in matters of great interest 
to mankind take their rise from vague and incorrect 
notions as to the nature of the subjects which come 
under the minds contemplation and in regard to 
the constant use of antiquated terms in works which 
professedly aim at the strengthening and guiding of 



vi preface 

the understanding we are fairly entitled to conclude 
that such terms ought to be limited to the smallest 
possible number to prevent a gloomy and myste 
rious air being given to that which in other respects 
might be considered as both pleasant and perspi 
cuous 

i have avoided as far as possible all controversial 
matter when a subject on which there still exists 
a diversity of opinion has crossed the path of my 
inquiries i have unqualifiedly adopted the principles 
of one party not with the most distant idea of pro 
nouncing a dogmatical verdict on the question at 
issue but solely from the wish to prevent the readers 
attention firom being drawn to topics which have only 
a remote connexion with the general principles of 
reasoning 

the late professor stewart remarks that a com 
prehensive and rational system of logic has never yet 
made its appearance if this opinion be correct it 
would be the height of presumption in me to hope 
that i had been able to accomplish so great an under 
taking but if my views on this subject should have 
the efiect even in the smallest degree of directing 
the minds of those who possess more knowledge and 
talents than i have to cultivate with care and as 
siduity this branch of philosophy i shall consider 
myself amply rewarded for my labour

chapter i 

pbeltminart obsttbvatlons 

the science of logic is commonlj defined to be the 
art of thinking correctly or of making a proper use 
of our reasoning faculties in our inquiries after truth 
and in pursuing a judicious plan of communicating 
that truth to others 

this science like some others grounded upon 
human nature has been greatly abused and misap 
plied from its legitimate purposes for a long pe 
riod it was employed merely as an instrument for in 
tellectual wrangling and trifling disputation for 

b 



s pheliminabt obsebvattons 

the discussion of empty subtleties rather than the 
development of useful truths to be a logician in 
former times was only synonymous with being a vain 
mental trifler an adept in the art of cavilling upon 
words one in jct who disguised his own real 
ignorance under the garb of verbal equivocation 
these times have however happily passed away 
though not without leaving seme pernicious conse 
quences behind them within this last century 
logic has in a great degree been disengaged from the 
jargon of the schools and reduced to a compara 
tively clear and iiiteliigible system yet notwith 
standing this it has not altogether redeemed its cha 
racter from nner reproaches but is still considerai 
by many evi of those who cultivate philosophy and 
gel jitxatur as a science of doubtful utility 
nd if tttdied at all it is only in compliance wih 
the regularly established and prescribed routine of 
aoademieal education 

in attentivelj perusii the different treatises on 
lc which have appeared m modem times the 
jwtder moawt il to have noticed the almost total 
wmnt f any object in ceuunob wmogst them or 



xneifillmlnart obevation 

lather the wtat of proper explanations as to the 
art of reasoning and the most usefiil rules fer 
making us acquainted with it in method also 
these works are remarkably deficient and there are 
seaieely any rules that are univerbally received or re 
oognised logic is regarded by one writer as con 
sisting in one thing and by another it is rarded 
as consisting principally of a different thing thus 
the student is bandied about fitmi one system to an 
other and from one set of rules and principles to an 
other till his attention becomes distracted and instead 
of learning something which will prove usem to him 
in his future progress in knowledge he is induced to 
pre up the subject as both fiitiguing and unpro 
fitable 

there seem to be two principal causes which ren 
der modem systems of logic both tiresome and com 
paratively useless and these are first the employ 
ment of a vast number of the dd scholastic terms 
and phrases derived from logicians of former times 
which throw over the art such an air of difficulty 
and perplexity that the reader before he has well 
entered upon the study of his sutiject is worn out by 



m fhkliminary obsebvatiom 

te mere pressure of uncouth words and is glad to 
make his retreat from such an irksome task with all 
possible expedition the second cause and one 
which is by far the most important is that our com 
mon books of logic may be said rather to treat of meta 
physical systems than to unfold those rules precepts 
and suggestions which are instrumental in directing 
the judgment to right conclusions on the various im 
portant subjects with which it is necessary that man 
should be well acquainted the generality of the 
books here alluded to have been founded upon the 
principle that before we could exercise our reasoning 
powers with energy and efltect before we could form 
right notions and give method and consistency to our 
conceptions it was absolutely necessary that we should 
be expert metaphysicians should be acquainted with 
all the mental speculations of the day and intimately 
and familiarly conversant with the anatomy and physi 
ology of our own minds but this i apprehend is a 
radical error in our common treatises on logic the 
fact is too generally overlooked that man comes itorth 
from the hand of his creator a reasoning being that 
lie learns to lay down premises make illustrations nd 



preliminary obbrratioib 

draw conclusions much in the same manner and 
with the same unerring certainty and readiness as he 
learns to walk to run and to speak the reasoning 
faculty of man is very early developed and those 
who have had opportunities of noticing the mental 
habits of children must have frequently observed 
that they reason and very sagaciously and cogently 
too at a very early period of their lives even in 
many cases before they can articulate plainly a single 
word 

but besides the consideration that the faculty of 
reason discovers itself at a very early period of our 
lives we have also another fact completely at variance 
with the position that a minute and accurate analy 
ds of our mental conceptions and faculties is highly 
necessary towards making us ready and forcible ge 
neral reasoners and the fact is this that history 
teaches us that those who have been most dis 
tinguished for their general knowledge and for the 
means of applying that knowledge to the common 
purposes of life have had little or no acquaintance 
with metaphysics or what is usually denominated 
 the philosophy of mind the opinion that the 



 pbbiilmikary obs£rvatioh 

impoitance of metaphysical knowledge as an instrnir 
ment of general reasoning has been greatly over 
rated in our common treatises on logic does not i 
think rest upon history alone for it is fully and 
amply confirmed by daily observation we invari 
ably find that where mental philosophy is exdu 
sively cultivated the general powers of reasoning are 
enfeebled and what is gained in subtlety is lost in 
strength no man appears more unfit for argumen 
tative discussion on the common and everyday topies 
which engage the attention of men of the world than 
the profound thinker or the man of mental abstrae 
tion and this is perfectly agreeable to the nature of 
things for a man who is daily and hourly observing 
the fleeting objects of his own consciousness and 
whose sole pleasure it is to be conversant with those 
evanescent shades of difference which subast between 
the various powers and fiiculties of his own mind 
becomes unfit by reason of the constant use of subtle 
and minute detail to grasp upon the spur of the 
moment the great and leading lieatures of any inte 
resting question or to make a deep and lasting im 
pression upon the minds of others by a powerful dis 



fbelihikabt obsebvatioi 

play of argumentative skill his power of mental 
analysis is too refined for objects of a formidable and 
gigantic nature and when he comes out into com 
mon life to measure his strength with the rustic 
minds around him be too often finds to his greet 
mortification that he is worsted and driven from the 
field by the athletic vigour of those who know no 
thing but what nature has taught them about the 
abstract nature of mind or the recondite rules of 
mental philosophy 

it is not however meant by these remarks to 
dirow the slightest discredit on the science of mind 
considered merely as a science but to show that its 
impcntance in leading to a habit of general and com 
prehensive reasoning has been greatly overrated it 
may justly be conceded that this science like many 
other branches of useful knowledge especially sub 
jects which relate to human nature imparts addi 
tional strength to our reasoning powers only how 
ever in the way of increasing our stock of informa 
tion and creating a habit of close thinking but 
all real knowledge is more or less instrumental 
in the aecomplisliment of this purpose and there 



 pbbliwinary obsebvation 

does not seem to be the slightest foundation for gii 
ing any preference on this account td the philosophy 
of mind above many other branches of knowledge 
a man may observe rules of diet and regimen calcu 
lated to preserve his health and increase his strength 
he may even increase the latter to a more than usual 
degree by the exercise of particular athletic games 
without having any accurate knowledge of the ana 
tomy or physiology of his frame and in like 
manner i conceive a man may learn to reason very 
cogently and correctly without being able to define 
what is meant by perception abstraction simple and 
complex ideas mixed modes and many other sub 
jects commonly treated of by writers on the human 
mind 

i have been led to make these few remarks upon 
the influence of an acquaintance with mental science 
on our general principles of reasoning in consequence 
of an opinion widely circulated by the late professor 
stewart and invested with all that authority which his 
great reputation could give it that it was only from a 
successful cultivation of our own minds that we could 
ever hope to rear a useful and solid system of logic 



pbrblimtnary obskbvatioks 

in the prekminarjf dissertation to his philosophical 
essays he says in order to prepare the way for a 
just and comprehensive system of logic a previous 
survey of our nature as one great whole is indispen 
sably requisite with all due deference to a writer 
so distinguished and so deservedly popular i can 
not help being of opinion that he has in the instance 
now quoted and throughout various parts of his 
works made use of language which seems to indicate 
that he had been led to entertain by far too lofty con 
ceptions of the precise limits and value of general 
logic and when this high standard was viewed by 
his mind through the medium of those enthusiastic 
feelings he had in favour of that particular branch of 
knowledge he so successfully cultivated we ought 
not to be surprised that he has a little overshot the 
mark in forming an estimate of the relative value of 
mental philosophy in directing and strengthening 
our principles of reasoning 

it appears to me therefore that a most accurate 
and comprehensive knowledge of all the powers and 
iaculties of the mind and of all the different modes 
and forms in which they act and react upon one an

powers of the mind by any tstoaatic writer what

application of this mental knowledge to the solution

from that by whieh a knowledge of the anatomy of

there is no mental quality so extensively valuable 
and so generally admired and coveted as that of readily 
apprehending truth and avoiding error a quick

 preliminary observations 

his happiness and comfort as a moral social and 
religious being may not suffer in consequence anj 
sensible diminution but men in all ranks and si 
tuations in life are obliged to be just and equitable 
prudent and discreet to a certain extent in all their 
transactions and must ever keep a steady and watch 
ful eye upon those numerous individual relations 
which spring out of the duties they owe to themselves 
and others unjust quarrels deeprootied wicked 
ness rash advice and ihconcocted enterprises are 
the necessary consequences of a feeble or perverted 
judgment hence one single error in reasoning on 
such interesting subjects as we have just alluded to 
may be the fruitai source of evils and trials to ua 
during the whole course of our lives 

there are two distinct classes of mankind embrace 
ing indeed the vast majority for whom every system 
of logic is professedly designed the one class com 
prehends all those who from natural dullness and 
stupidity are incapable of giving the necessary de 
gree of attention to objects around them so as to dis 
cover their relations and connexions one with another 
nearly all the erroneous opinions and sentiments of 



pbelxminart ob£av anions 

the world on matters of moment take their rise 
from a casual and precipitate consideration of matters 
which come before them rather than from any strong 
principle of dislike to truth itself they judge rashly 
from an obscure and confused conception of the ma 
terials on which their minds are called upon to pass 
judgment and the feeble love of truth which dwdls 
in their bosoms is too weak to keep up a constant 
habit of rational investigation and on this account 
they become inclined on all occasions to take things 
for granted rather than enter into a long or laborious 
investigation respecting them the other class of 
persons may be said to fall into the opposite extreme 
and become victims to a vulgar scepticism gonsi 
dering the discrepancies of opinion among mankind 
as an infallible sign that there is nothing certain 
they dliscard every kind and degree of evidence 
truth loses all her charms in their eyes and they 
either become elated with some extravagant fancy 
which takes firm hold of their understandings or fall 
into a state of sottish obstinacy out of which no ra 
tional expostulations can rouse them 

i ought not to be inferred from these remarks that 



 pbslitflkabt obsrbvations 

logic will prove an infallible remedy for mental blind 
ness and imperfection of esvery degree on the con 
trary it should careftilly be impressed upon the mind 
of the reader what logical arrangements can and 
what they cannot perform many run away with 
the idea that if they only learn logic they are then 
in a fit state to understand all matters and by re 
ducing every aigument to some particular verbal 
form they begin to oonodve they are masters of the 
subject and are capable of enlightening others also 
in the same department of knowledge but this 
though a yry common isnfnerthelessamost delusive 
and tal enmr all that can be done by any raticmal 
system of logic is merely to lay down a few plain 
rules for the govemmait of the understanding and 
leave the rest to the natural resources ot the mind it 
self we ought to bear in our recollection that the 
moment we envelop any subject in the tiff and for 
mal drapery of logical rules we run a great risk of 
bewildering both ourselves and our readers persons 
in general entertain fiir too high an opinion of the 
usefulness of even the most judieious systems of logic 
in fiicilitating the acquisition of knowledge the

to which it can with propriety be applied is not by 
any means very considerable it will not constitute 
a short ox royal road to the knowledge of subjects

these qualifications of the mind into active operation

on the objects of a bational system of looic 
and to what depabtments of know ledob it 
can be with pbopbiety applied 

it ought to be the principal aim of a sound and use 
ful system of logic to point out to us in some de 
gree the imperfections and obstacles which are thrown 
in our way when studying subjects connected with 
human nature and to show us the reason why truths 
connected with these subjects do not receive so ready 
and uniform an assent as truths of a mathematical 
nature or truths relating to experimental philosophy 
in doing this we ought to ask ourselves two ques 
tions first to what branches of knowledge logic can 
properly be applied and secondly for what end this 
art of reasoning is required in reference to such 
branches of knowledge 



objects of a rational sydtkm of looic 

now it appears to me that the art of logic is con 
fined by its very nature to subjects connected with 
human nature or perhaps to speak more plainly to 
the following four branches of knowledge namely 
mental philosophy moral philosophy the science 
of politics in its widest sense including jurispru 
dence and the art of government and also religion 
both natural and revealed 

these four branches of knowledge really contain 
every thing to which the science of logic can be ap 
plied for it must be observed here that these 
divisions include every thing of a debatable or argu 
mentative nature they give rise of themselves to 
discussion their general principles are all liable to 
be viewed in different lights and from this cause 
men are led to entertain very contrary nay opposite 
opinions on some of those important and vitally in 
teresting topics 

on account of the disputable nature of these 
branches of knowledge we need the assistance of some 
rules to enable us to come to a certain conclusion re 
garding their truth and also to be able to convey 
that knowledge in as easy and familiar a manner as 



 on the objects of 

f 

possible to others we call these rules bj the name of 
logic and we require to have them collected together 
and applied to the four divisions of knowledge alluded 
to for the purpose of being better acquainted witii 
them to see on which side truth lies apd to havci 
fixed in our minds certain general and particular ideas 
relative to the several constituent parts we are to 
bear in mind that we want these rules not for help 
ing us if that wre possible to see the truth of a de 
monstraticm the contrary of which we cannot con 
ceive but to guide our minds in tliose departments 
of knowledge where opposite facls and opposite ar 
guments clash against each other and where the 
mind may become perplexed and confused by the 
weighing and consideration of such conflicting mate 
rials as are submitted to its contemplation it is for 
this purpose that the art of logic is wanted 

when we consider that the nature and operations 
q£ our own mind our moral constitution our politi 
cal relations and religious duties must ever can 
stitute the most important sciences among man 
kind we will perceive the propriety and utility of 
making ourselves thoroughly acquainted with their 



a rational sttkm of logic 

leading feahures because such a general aoquain 
tanoe is intimately connected with our vital interests 
and obligations aa social and accountable beings 
a knowledge of the nature of man in the dirent 
rdutions which we have just enumerated is not like 
the knowledge of many things else which is sometimes 
eagerly sought after and highly prized by the lovers 
of literature and science as a mere specimen of spe 
culaiive imriosity or argumentative dexterity but 
a knowledge of our nature is in almost every dee 
influential upon our conduct and therefore its sue 
cessful cultivation and proper alication become 
matters of serious concern to every man if we con 
duct our inquiries into human nature upon a ra 
tional plan and with rational objects in view we 
will find there is scarcely any part of our inward 
frames the examination or contemplation of which 
is exclusively adapted to communicate only barq 
amusement or intellectiml recreation fivery thing 
here is of importance because every thing must have 
an influence on our conduct and this conduct must 
again possess an influence in a greater or less degree 
upon the happiness and welre of others no one 



 fm the objects of 

earries about with him sets of opinions on the nature 
and properties of his own mind moral obligation 
political science and religious principles as mere 
mental playthings but these opinions must produce 
important results upon the charapter sentiments and 
condition of not only the solitary individual who 
adopts them but of many others also who ivfe within 
e sphere of his iniluence 

we ought therefore to be very careful not to in 
culcate a notion into the minds of the young in par 
ticular that they may ramble carelessly and indif 
ferently among the various branches of study con 
nected with human nature as they would ramble in 
the fields of natural philosophy just as it might 
suit their taste or accord with their fancies 

one of the most fruitful sources of contention 
among men on subjects of moment is from the dif 
ferent views which disputants take of the nature and 
fulness of the evidence which any given branch can 
furnish to our minds no logical rules can possibly 
lead the way to a satisfactory or universally admitted 
conclusion of any disputed question when this con 
sideration is not attended to au things become 



a bational stteh logic 

dim and mdfued and it not unfrequtly happens 
that each disputant reduoes his arguments to the 
same logical terms though for the purpose of sup 
porting diametruly opposite conclusions thus 
logic instead of being used as an instrument for 
leading us to truth becomes converted into a sophis 
tical nd dangerous habit our errors are thus 
perpetuated from one generation to another by rea 
son of the different mistaken standards of evidence 
which are adopted to estimate the truth of certain 
subjects 

to remedy in some measure this erroneous me 
thod of reasoning we will endeavour to lay before 
the reader a brief and condensed view of the nature 
of the truths on which certain subjects are founded 
we will afterwards shew that logic properly so call 
ed can only be applied to four branches of know 
ledge namely the laws of mind of moral obligation 
of political relations and of religion in following this 
plan it cannot be expected that we should lay down 
a regular system on each of these heads and notice 
at length each and all the objections which dispu 

tltnts have ured against them whether oollectivelj 
 



 on thisk objects iflf 

or individually the only thing necessary ibr the 
purpose intended is for us to see the land and degree 
of evidence which we can possibly have for any par 
ticular subject so that when we begin either to ex 
amine it or to dispute upon it we may tiy its me 
rits by that standard of evidence which really belongs 
to it and not by another which may have only an in 
direct or incidental relation to it this is a matter 
of great importance for if we carry about with us 
at all times correct ideas of the nature of a subject 
—a thorough knowledge of the principles on which 
it rests and the kind and force of evidence which 
it is by its nature calculated to afford us we will 
seldom be led far from the truth or be apt to fall 
into those speculative errors which arise from not 
correctly distinguishing the difierences in the reason 
ing process among the various topics of hutnan in 
vestigation every subject will be estimated by its 
own laws of evidence when we treat of the tnind 
we will not apply precisely the same rules of reason 
ing which we employ in treating of natural and re 
vealed religion nor when we come to examine the 
latter will we estimate it by the principles of evi

will have its due situation in the mind and it will 
resemble a wellordioed dwellings where all confusion 
is avoided and every thing occupies its own jntppet 
place for use andmfort 

it will be necessary to explain here what is meant 
by such terms as subjects connected wuh human 
nature f or related to human nature which will 
firequdy occur throughout this treatise these 
phrases are meant to rresent au or any part of 
the subjects to which i think the art of logic can 
rightly be applied iameljj mental inquiriesf morals 
politics and religion it is true that all knowledge 
is connected with or related to human nature but 
the common way in which that knowledge is divided 
and the usual phraseology employed to express these 
divisions authorize me to make use of such general 
terms as the subjects or topics of human nature for 
the purpose of avoiding tedious and unseemly repe 
titions with this explanation no confusion or 
ambiguity it is presumed can take place in the ap 
plication of these terms 

before entering upon the specific nature of the 



 objects of a rational system of xooic 

evidence belonging to those departments of know 
ledge which the art of logic may be useful in deciding 
it will prove of advantage to make a few remarks on 
the nature of mathematical reasoning and also to 
examine how far the argumentative faculties are ex 
ercised in the various departments of natural philo 
sophy these observations will have the effect of 
clearing away some embarrassments and misconcep 
tions which might prove very troublesome in the 
subsequent parts of our journey

on the nature of mathematical evidence 
and its influence when aplied to other 
branches of knowlede with a few re 
marks on the evidence of natural philo 
sophy 

there is a considerable difference between mathe 
matical reasoning and the reasoning we employ 
upon subjects connected with human nature many 
philosophers have imagined that it might be possible 
to unite them together and have indulged the vain 
idea diat all our knowledge of mind of our moral 
constitution of our political relations and of our re 
ligious systems would by the gradual improvement 
of human art and the simplification of the rules of 
logic be rendered as clear as mathematics and be 
completely assimilated to that species of evidence 
with which thid latter branch of knowledge furnishes 



 on the natitbe of mathematical evtdsmcx 

us it would fill a volume to barely enumerate all the 
speculations of ingenious men on this subject but 
a careful examination of the matter will warrant us 
in affirming that these axe the dreams of philosophers 
grounded upon a misconception of the abstract na 
ture of the mind the extent of its powers and the 
varied materials of what constitutes our general 
knowledge the history of philosophy does not pre 
sent us with a single solitary ct to induce us to 
think that thare has been any favourable though 
silent influence exerting itself during the more re 
cent improvements in letters to approximate the 
evidence in the investigation of subjects connected 
with human nature to mathematical deductions 
or to lead us to believe that a sort of philosophi 
cal millennium will soon arrive when all our know 
ledge relating to the mind of man and to his con 
stitution as a social and immortal being will be 
as easily obtained and as mechanically communicated 
to others as a question in anthmetic or a simple 
geometrical problem on the contrary nature as 
well as observation clearly points out to us that there 
isa fixed onalteiable and canstittttionaldiffflrbbce in

pint out more hmj 

the terms emplced in mathematical reasonings 
are always of a fixed and definite ehamcter and are 
invuriably used in one sense thus tmemty are al 
ways twenty a square is always a square and an 
angte always an angle and it is this circumstance 
which adds so greatly to the fofce of the evidioe of 
 science of number and quantity if the terms in 
mathemaiios were as liable to variation as the terms 
we employ on subjects mre immediately connected 
with human nature disputes and oontentionb would 
be as numerous and violent among mathematicians 
as among momlists and politicians 

mathematies may be termed a pure intelleetual 
sctenoe that ts it is so pure or complete in its own 
nature that the contrary to any one of its affirmations 
can never be conceived by the human mind no man 
can form to himself an idea how three and three

iain all the parts and properties of a wbole circle 
these are ikuppositions which our minds cannot con 
ceive however varied or longcontinued the efisnrts to 
conceive them the mathematician therefore has 
no choice but to agree with the proposittmis submit 
ted to his contemplation he is like a man put into 
a path and compelled if he move at all to go 
straight forwaid but without the liberty of turning 
either to the right band or to the left in all other 
branches of knowledge some differences in the very 
nature of their fundamental positions can be con 
ceived by the mind in natural philosophy we can 
easily imagine various alteraticms or modifications of 
what are termed the laws of nature we could sup 
pose many changes in chemical science in electri 
city in magnetism c and in morals we could 
imagine certain personal as well as general benefits to 
be connected with conduct which we are now led to 
tink very reprehensible and destructive and in po 
litical matters we can easily comprehend how some 
measures which are now oonidded founded in truth 
and wisdom might be so modified or entirely changed 
as to produce effects the very contrary to those whieh 



on tbs katube of mathematical etibencs 

entitle them to be legarded as the result of a just 
and enlightened policy all these varieties in the 
actual constitution of things our minds can readily 
conceive but any alteration oc modification in the 
conceptions we form of numbers and quantity we 
have it not in our power to imagine and in this 
respect the science of mathematics £rms an excep 
tion to all other branches human learning 

a very slight examination of the matter will soon 
enable a person to perceive the great difference which 
exists between the nature of subjects relating to hu 
man nature and those relating to mathematics we 
will do well at all times to view with some degree of 
suspicion those jninciples and opinions which seem 
to be grounded exclusively upon the basis of a com 
plete analogy between the firmer subjects and the 
latter it is true that all truth bears a common 
relation to the human mind but the is notwith 
standing a very great difference between the manner 
in which we arrive at moral conclusions for example 
and that in which we arrive at conclusions in arith 
metic or geometry in moral science nothing in 
the reasoning process can be affirmed as being good

be compared to a flight i steps whidi thoirh doseiy 
and necessarily connected together may become se 
parately objects of the minds perception and these 
steps lead us in our progress fiom one ehamb of 
truth as it were to another but they must all be 
considered in the eye of abstract truth as equally 
true and equally important 

 now we do sot i conceive find any thing pra 
cisdy analogous to this in nmal science good and 
evil are not things which can be dealt with by rule 
and compasses or which can be represented l num 
ber and figure if a man rob his neighbour of his 
property and afterwards take away his life the vari 
ous means which were used for these purposes and 
the divers circumstances which accompanied these

taking away of li these means and circumatan 
ces may become objects of our minds contemplation 
and topics of censttre and of diseussion but they only

do so by virtue of their end or ultimate object which 
we denominate a highly criminal and vicious action 
these means and circumstances may be altered in a 
thousand different ways or may be either partially or 
wholly false but these considerations will not alter 
our opinions or feelings as to the wickedness of rob 
bery and murder in the science of morals we can 
talk over and discuss the merits or demerits of cha 
rity love hatred theft or murder and the actions 
which these words are severally f made to represent 
may become individual objects of our perception 
without being necessarily connected with any given 
set of means and circumstances but in mathematics 
there is no proposition barring the primary defini 
tions the truth of which can be made manifest with 
out the assistance of some other truths axioms or 
propositions 

these few remarks on the peculiar nature of ma 
thematical evidence when compared with the evi 
dence which other subjects can afford will perhaps 
prove a suitable preparation for discussing the ques

a deep and accurate knowledge of mathematigs con 
tributes to make men reason with more force preci

viewed in connexion with the education of youth 
and i believe the general opinion entertained by liter 
ary men is in favour of an affirmative answer to it 
but i must confess i have long looked upon the ex 
clusive attention paid to mathematical leamiag as of 
questionable utility in any establishment formed for 
the purpose of communicating a general system of

of the principal reasons why that kind of knowledge 
which comes home to mens business and bosoms is 
comparatively speaking thrown into the background

gress of our minds when illustrating the truth of a 
n£athematical problem nay ho completely dissi 
milar are political and mathematical reasonings in 
their very nature and essence that a mere appeal to 
consciousness in both cases should be sufficient to 
induce us to acknowledge that we arrive at truth in 
morals by the employment of quite different original 
powers of the mind from those which we employ 
when we are demonstrating truths relating to num 
ber and quantity or at least that there are some 
powers called into requisition in the former case 
which are never put forth as far as we can perceive 
in the latter 

a strong predilection for mathematical investiga 
tions and a deep acquaintance with them are ex 
tremely apt to make us dissatisfied with the degree of 
evidence involved in other sciences the mathema 
tician being long accustomed to the smooth and 
beaten track of his favourite study enters upon the 
more rugged paths which lead to a knowledge of hu 
man nature with some degree of reluctance and he 
is frequently in the habit of making to himself com 
parisons between the easy and happy mamier in 



on the natttbe of mathematical evidsncx 

which truth is developed in the one case and die dxt 
ficult with which he can arrive at it in the other 
thus a feeling is created and trains of diought en 
gendered in a thinking mind which exercise a veiy 
striking and marked influence on its progress in ge 
neral knowledge and men are thus insensibly led 
a it were without in fact being at all aware of the 
secret power which so decidedly influences their 
choice to give a marked preference to mathematical 
studies over those which must by all be considered 
to possess a r more deep and solemn interest to the 
human race whether considered in relation to their 
state here or hereafter it is very natural there 
fore in siich circumstances that the sciences of the 
human mind of moral and political philosophy as 
well as the doctrines and principles of natural and 
revealed religion should be viewed under a sombre 
and discouraging aspect should be made to occupy 
a low station in our estimation and be considered to 
yield us less pleasure and delight in their cultivation 
because these important branches of human inquiry 
are founded upon evidence of a different description 
from that to which we have given so decided a pre

firenee how often do we hear mathematiciaiis be 
wail the difficulties they meet with when thej wan 
der from their own folds and how often do we hear 
them giving utterance to the pkasing but forlom 
hope of seeing au knowledge reduced to mathemati 
cal certainty and precision these and similar 
aentimoits are quite current among literary men 
and they have their foundation in the generally pie 
vaifing notion that mathematical truths are con 
nected by a firmer and more beautifully connected 
chain of evidence than that which binds the various 
departments of knowledge which come under the de 
nomination cs human nature 

this low and erroneous estimate which is formed 
of the rod value of subjects connected with mans na

made to occupy in the mind of a speculative inquirer is 
one of tlie many fruitfid sources of infidelity i can

of youth committed to their charge to be habitually 
on their guard against an error of this description 
which is calculated to produce a very bad moral effect 
upon young persons as well as to impair the healthy 
exercise of their minds 

if we examine mathematics in an intellectual point 
of view„ there appears to be something of a mechani 
cal turn in the acquisition of its truths and it is by 
no means evident that to excel in mathematical in 
vestigations the more lofty and elevated of our men 
tal powers are required to be brought into exercise 
there is a ct besides established by the history of 
philosophy in all ages and countries which pointedly 
bears out this opinion namely that we have daily 
instances of persons making themselves proficients in 
mathematical science at a very early age but we 
never find that a person becomes eminent in mental 
moral or political jilosophy or religious knowledge 
till more advanced in life there is scarcely an in 
stance of a writer on any of these latter branches of 
science who has ever become distinguished till he 
was at or past the meridian of life but there have 
been many examples of a perct knowledge of the 



on the natube op mathematical evidence 

sciences of number and quantity before the age of 
manhood this is a fact founded upon the natural 
course of the human mind and clearly teaches us 
that higher qualities of intellect are required to rea 
son upon and comprehend questions on topics relat 
ing to human nature than are necessary in the solu 
tion of problems connected with the pure sciences 
and it is doubtless in conformity with the principle 
which this mental fact goes to illustrate that the 
practice has been adopted in almost all civilized na 
tions of filling high and responsible civil and ma 
gisterial offices with persons pretty far advanced in 
years the public would have little confidence in 
the wisdom of a chief magistrate or judge at fourteen 
or fifteen years of age even if he brought forward as 
a recommendation for office the mathematical skill 
of a newton or a la place 

that an exclusive attention to mathematical rea 
soning unfits a person for judging with accuracy on 
subjects of human nature has now grown into a com 
mon proverb and is even admitted by many writers 
who are nevertheless decidedly of opinion that a mode 
rate attention to mathematical forms of reasoning tends 



 on the nature mathematicai evidbncb 

to strengthen the judgment and prepare it for every 
other inquiry now how are we to account tar these 
notionsif mathematics are so useful as is commonly as 
serted in making us reason more forcibly and correctly 
on other mattes it is but fair to presume that if ma 
thematical forms of reasoning were so beneficial the 
more profoundly they were studied and the more 
steadily and invariably they were adhered to the 
mental advantages would be the greater and the more 
obvious but there appears to me to be a great 
deal more than what meets the eye in the admission 
that mathematical forms are apt to be abused or mis 
applied this extorted confession from somewhat 
reluctant witnesses must have proceeded from a set 
tled conviction that the pure sciences were in some 
degree defective in being made the foundation of a 
generally extended system of mental cultivation 

there is an important fact to which we may ad 
vert as strengthening the general position we wish to 
establish it is this that we find that whenever 
authcnrs have been led either from education or early 
predilection to adopt the mathematical form of rea 
soning in matters relating to the nature of man such

all conversant with even tb outlines of philosophy 
must be well awre that this is ikt a hasty or random 
assertihi 

natural or experimental philosophy differs in many 
leqpects from mathemal the foundation of the 
fcmner is not the same as that of the lattor and 
tlrefore we find a dissimilarity between the kind 
and degree of evidence employed in each of these two 
depaxtments of science mathematics is a purely 
iyfeejtual sdienoe and the evidence derived from

the contemplation of it is of the most decided and 
unchangeable nature but natural philosophy is 
founded upon observation analogy and the testimony 
of others it is not intuitively certain but it rests 
upon the evidence of our external senses 

from the observations in the preceding chapter 
on the subjects to which logic can with propriety be 
applied it may be asked do we mean to assert that 
the forms of logic are not useful or cannot be strictly 
applied to natural philosophy the answer to this 
question i apprehend is that in a certain qualified 
sense the rules and forms of logic are of use in the 
various departments of natural as well as of mental or 
moral science it may however be observed that if 
there had never been any other branches of knowledge 
than such as are comprehended in mathematics and 
natural philosophy the science of logic would never 
have been thought necessary to arrange the objects 
and reasonings of which they are composed from 
the very nature of the mind of man and the mate 
rials with which it makes itself conversant in experi 
mental science there is a natural aptitude in these

is considered an object of wonder and amazement

their own minds and if their effirts have not hi

and the like and by smelling the di£perent effluvia 
emanating from an almost endless variety of sub 
stances 

the second class of objects is composed of our in 
ternal feelings or consciousness and the operations of 
our own minds or the notions or ideas which are 
perpetually occupying us when we are said to think 
of our own inward nature these objects are as nu 
merous and diversified as those a knowledge of which 
is derived from the material world 

this simple power of perception is commonly con 
sidered as the instrument by which we obtain smtable 
objects or materials for the occupation of our minds 
these intimations of outward objects and their quali 
ties as well as our inward feelings are said to be 
perceived by the mind a phrase which every one un 
derstands but which has become in the hands of 



os this mxn dd 

philosophers a source of improfilahk and endless dis 
cussion 

memory this is another strikingly marked and 
welldefined power of the mind it is of unspeakable 
importance to us it consists in treasuring up past 
impressions or notions or trains of thought in the 
mind no formal or lengthened efinition of this 
power is here necessary as every one is well acquaint 
ed with its province and mode of operation 

there are certain circumstances which tend to 
deepen and more thoroughly impress upon our re 
membrance particular objects or events and produce 
a more vivid and interesting representation of past 
occurrences in life these circumstances constitute 
what are called the laws of memoryf and have been 
objects of notice and interest among mankind from 
the earliest records of their history to the present mo 
ment 

imagination this is another conspicuous faculty 
of the mind and is well known to every human be 
ing of sane understanding we are so constituted 
that we are not confined to mere realities but we can 
conjure up a thousand representations and combina 



 on the mind 

tions of things whidi never had and never can have 
any real existence this power is the fruitful source 
of many of our pleasures as well as inconveniences 
and hence its proper cultivation and guidance become 
of infinite importance to the wellbeing and hap 
ness of nian 

abmtraction this faculty of the mmd is employed 
in considering one thing apart from another thing 
with which it may be accidentally or necessarily con 
nected we can for example attend to the colour 
of an object without at the same time thinking of its 
precise shape its roughness or other properties this 
is a faculty of great use and importance as will be 
shown in the subsequent parts of this work 

reasoning no particular notice need be taken of 
this power here its nature will be sufficiently point 
ed out in the second part of this volume 

it must appear obvious to the reader that the 
knowledge of the human mind is founded upon the 
most powerful and incontrovertible evidence we 
rest upon conseiomness or iniemal feelings which 
furnishes the highest kind of testimony no one 
can rationally dispute the existence of his own feel 



ok thb lund 

lags of if he do he must as a natural consequence 
be prepared to give up all kinds and degrees of know 
ledge as ddusive and uncertain the doubts which 
have been attempted to be dtrown upon the whole 
science of mindi are the most unreasonable that can 
possibly be imagined the preference which has 
been given to some other brandies of knowledge and 
even to peculations of a mental nature on account 
of the more convincing and forcible evidence th are 
supposed to afford has arisen entirely from a miscon 
eeption in reference to the nature of that evidence 
which accompanies the internal workings of our prin 
ciple of thought but while we stoutly maintain the 
claim of mental philosophy to be regarded as the very 
fountain of rational evidence we are not at the same 
time insennble to the existence and operation of those 
causes whidi tended with the majority of readers 
to shroud that philosophy in the tiiick veil of obscu 
rity and to cause her intimations to be received with 
coldness and distrust 

the logical difficulties which arise to the prose 
cution of metaphysical inquiries mayi perhaps be 
attributed to two principal causes 



 on ths mind 

 philosophers aim at too much they are not 
content with the degree of knowkdge which has beeti 
allotted to them they wish to pry into matters that 
are shut out from their cognizance in treating on 
topics connected with the mind of man we should 
always take into account the natural difficulties of the 
subject itself it must be acknowledged on all hands 
that to analyze the powers of thought is an arduous 
and intricate process and there must on this ac 
count always be a considerable difference of opinion 
concerning those objects which come within the range 
if our internal investigations we cannot therefore 
in our pursuit of truth here expect to go smoothly on 
without meeting with questions of an intricate and 
puzzling description bat these ought not to throw 
our minds off their proper balance nor drive us to the 
sceptical conclusion that all inquiries regarding our 
minds are useless and unsatisfiictory this would not 
be to act the part of rational but of irrational beings 

 what are called improvements in mpdern 
language have beena fruitful source of error and dif 
ferences of opinion on mental subjects we shall 
treat of the influence of language on all branches of 



on thx mimd 

knowledge in another part of this work but we will 
just meniion in passing that in metaphysics these 
misnamed improvements have not by any means real 
ized the expectations which many sensible and ceal 
ous admirers of this science at one time anticipated 
from them the ct is that a too minute analysis 
of the mind has been attempted by philosophers and 
a facility of coining new terms and phrases has led 
them to set by fiur too high a value upon their specu 
lations many instances could be adduced from the 
history of mental philosophy within these last hundred 
years to show that numerous systems have been framed 
with plausible pretensions to originality and import 
ance which upon mature examination could be proved 
to rest upon nothing but a new verbal nomenclature 
we can scarcely expect that time will remedy this evil 
for the operations of our minds seem peculiarly liable to 
be the sport of mere dealers in new words and phrases 
but we hope these two or three hints on the influence 
of language will not be altogether thrown away upon the 
reader but will lead him to view with wholesome jea 
lousy every theory of the mind whidi comes recom 
mended to his notice in the garb of a new phraseology

on mrai 



we have the same kind and degree of evidence for 
the truth and obligation of several leading principles 
of morals as we have for the existence and laws of 
our inteuectual nature every man carries within 
him the seeds of good and evil and no one can deny 
the reality and importance of moral distinctions 
without doing violence to his own nature and bring 
ing swift destruction upon himself 

it will not be necessary here to give a formal out 
line of any particular system of morals similar to the 
sketch of the mind which we have ventured to give 
in the foregoing chapter a certain portion of know 
ledge of the nature and powers of the mind seems 



on vokals 

necessftrily coquected with the treatment of one of its 
most important facultieshat of reasoning but 
all lt seems to be requisite in this chapter is to 
button the reader against forming erroneous opinions 
in reference to the nature of moral reasoning and to 
point out tp him those recesses into which sophistical 
writers frequently drive their followers and in which 
they occasionally take shelter themselves 

 sceptical conclusions on the science of morals 
are often drawn from the various conflicting opinions 
among mankind on the nature of virtue some 
classes of men call that a virtuous and paiseworthy 
deed which others think wicked and disracefiil 
and it mut be acknowledged on all hands that the 
diflenccys i judgmt on this important subject are 
very numerous and of a strikingly marked duuacser 

 erroneous opinions on moral obligation proceed 
from partial and contracted views of present enjoy 
ment and advantage this is a very fruitful source 
of disputation among mankind and indeed every per 
son is more or less liable to be misled by this almost 
universal tendency 

 the mind is frequently led to reason improperly 



 on moralt 

on the nature and extent of moral duty from our na 
tural imperfection the fact is sufsciently wdl esta 
blished that all men are morally depraved and are 
prone to indulge their appetites and passions to their 
own injury as well as to the injury of others 

to guard the mind in some degree against the 
influence of these causes of error in reasoning both 
on abstract and practical morality we ought to ac 
custom ourselves to take as comprehensive a view as 
possible of mans moral nature and relations if we 
do this we will perceive that the general principles 
of morals are well founded and almost universally 
admitted this is a provision made for the continua 
tion of our race all men are obliged to act upon 
these principles of moral obligation as being in fiiet 
intimately connected with their immediate happiness 
and wellbeing

political philosophy 



by the tenn political philosophy we must under 
stand every thing connected with civil government 
the administration of justice the production and di 
fusion of wealth and whatever is immediately pro 
ductive of the social happiness and wellbeing of a 
people a nation is to be considered in the light of 
a great family and whatever promotes the safety 
peace and comfort of that family may properly 
enough come under the denomination of politics 

it must be obvious to the reader that a vast field 
is here opened to the reasoning faculties of man in 
no department of human speculation and inquiry 
are there fiercer contentions more contradictory 
opinions and a more vehement desire after victory 
manifested than in debates upon political science 



 political wilosopht 

a person looking on political discussions from a 
distance and unacquainted with the leading princi 
ples of the science would be apt to come to the 
conclusion that all here was uncertainty uproar and 
confrision that no one fundamental principle was 
beyond the reach of dispute and that truth seemed 
to make her escape from those engaged in the general 
and boisterous scramble to lay hold of her indeed 
thf ct is undeniable that many soberminded per 
ms give themselves up to a vulgar kind of scepti 
icism on political matters and maintain that ere is 
nothing true or at least indisputably true m the 
science 

but a moments considation will be sufficient to 
tow any person that matters connected with the 
security and happiness of a nation are preemi 
nently calculated o give rise to the highest eerr 
tions of intellect and the proudest efforts of logical 
skill eyexk the subordinate divisions of this depart 
ment of knowledge aire calculated to call forth the 
highest powers of reasoning the doubts which 
some are led to entertain as to the solidity of the 
principles on which political knowledge is grounded 



political philosophy 

nuiy fiiirlj be referred to causes unconnected with 
their abstract truth we shall briefly allude to a 
few of the most important of them 

 liogical difficulties arise from the very compli 
cated nature of the science of politics we have 
only under the most fistvourable circumstances a very 
liinited view of the consequences of any given mea 
sure and it is often a veiy painful task to keep up 
such a degree of attention as will enable us to trace 
its beariiigs through the almost endless ramifications 
of society the mind is apt to become confounded 
by the multiplicity of objects which at once solicit 
and demand its attention 

 a fruitful source of diflferenoe of opinion on 
political topics is that the inteiests of mankind are so 
closely and personally connected with their discus 
ua it will in nine cases out of ten be a hopeless 
task to convince a man of the expediency or wisdom 
of any particular course of social policy if his iuterp 
ests are likely to be deeply bjured by its adoption 
he will resist all kinds and degrees of evidence in 
maay other branches of knowledge though all bear 
ing more or less upon tlie interests of mankind dis 



 political philosophy 

cussions are conducted with comparative calmness 
and disinterestedness but political questions come 
more immediately in collision with the interests of 
particular classes of persons in the community and 
their minds are thereby put into a state which unfits 
them for giving the requisite degree of patient and 
dispassionate attention to those distinct principles on 
which the truth and expediency of such questions 
rest 

 the want of that power of the mind which 
seizes hold of general principles and handles them 
with dexterity and ease is also a fruitfiil source of 
erroneous conclusions in the science of politics with 
out this power no man can lay claim to the title of a 
politician in the proper sense of that word if a 
perscm do not possess this faculty of the mind his 
reasonings will in almost all cases proceed on some 
isolated and unimportant fact and thus he will trifle 
away his life disputing on every thing and under 
standing nothing 

 the mixed nature os political measures is the 
cause of much error to the best and ablest of men 
some measures are of a partially beneficial character 



political philosophy 

and on their first introduction promise well for the 
happiness and comfort of the people at large but in 
the longrun these very measures are often found to 
be disastrous and ruinous in the extreme and we 
are thus obliged after a season of fond anticipations 
to retrace our steps and acknowledge our error this 
makes us liable for the aiture to distrust the con 
clusions of our own understandings 



 



chapter vii 

on reuozon — natural avp rxrbaiej 

we come now to examine the evidence of one of 
the most important branches of human knowledge 
whatever differences of opinion may exist among 
mankind as to the value and abstract nature of reli 
gious principles and observances one conclusion can 
not fail to be admitted even hj that class of persons 
who vauntingly boast of being beyond the reach of 
any religious influence namely that if the general 
doctrines of religion be supported by such a degree of 
rational proof as their advocates allege then theology 
must be confessed to be by far the most important 
inquiry which can occupy the mind of a human being 
in the short space which the limits of this work 
can allot to the consideration of this vital subject it 
cannot be expected that we should even be able to 



on rjbmoion 

give a bare enumeration of the principles of natural 
and revealed religion in all their ramifications and 
bearings what is intended here is merely to make 
a few general remarks which may guide the judgment 
of the reader when examining theological topics and 
prevent him from entertaining lse and enoneous 
notions in reference to the nature and degiees of evir 
dence by which they are supported 

religion with us obviously divides itself into two 
kinds natural religion and revealed religiim it is 
not our province to enter into nice and intricate dis 
cissions as to the boundaries of each or to ascertain 
the point at which the one begins and the other ends 
the division now made is agreeable to common 
usage and like all usages of a simikr kind must 
have had its origin in clear and welldefined distinc 
tions in the nature of things 

natural religion includes our primary notions as 
to the existence and attributes of a superior intelli 
gent power our impression of another state of exist 
ence after death and the doctrine of fixture rewards 
and punidunents the more circumstantial and 
minute our inquiries on this subject the more clearly 



 on beliqion 

do we perceive that man comes into the world pos 
sessed of the elementary principles of religious adora 
tion and fear to whatever spot of earth we direct 
our attention we there see the emblems of a firm 
belief in some allpowerful and intelligent cause 
we meet with priests and temples rites and cere 
monies and a regularly established and organized 
system for the purpose of keeping up a religious in 
tercourse with that being who is feared and adored 
and so common are these signs of religious worship 
in the different nations of the earth that it may 
safely be affirmed that there is not one wellauthen 
ticated exception to the universality of the practice 
it is perfectly true tht the objects of religious vener 
ation have been in all ages and are at this day 
among heathen nations exceedingly diversified and 
uniformly absurd but still the vast importance 
which every country attaches to its own deity and its 
own peculiar mode of worship fully warrant us in 
drawing the conclusion that religion must have its 
foundation in the nature of man 

revealed religion may be regarded as including 
the doctrines and precepts of the old and new testa 



an rbliqion 

ments the fundamental principles of natural reli 
gion are here more fliuy illustrated and established 
and the faint intimations of nature become invested 
with all the powerful vividness of reality but in 
addition to the most complete confirmation of natural 
theology the scriptures contain some peculiar doc 
trines and precepts of which the constitution of our 
nature gives us no intimation or at least if there 
be any such intimation it is of such a weak and 
evanescent kind as not to exercise any practical in 
fluence over our opinions and conduct 

the evidences for the truth of natural and revealed 
religion are of the most conclusive description for 
the sake of clearness we will follow the general and 
popular division of them into two kinds namely the 
external and internal evidences the external evi 
dences for natural religion rest upon facts that there 
is a universal feeling or notion among mankind of a 
superior power of another state of existence with 
rewards and punishments and that there are innu 
merable rites and ceremonies to which these opinions 
give birth the external evidences for revealed reli 
gion are that christianity is to be considered as a 



 on ksligion 

system resting upon promises prefigured by types 
intimated by propbecy testified by miracles and con 
firmed by events the internal evidences of the 
truth of natural religion are derived from the fitness 
and suitableness of these universal rdigious opinions 
and ceremonies to promote in some measure at least 
the happiness and comfort of man the internal 
evidences of the truth of revelation are almost un 
limited they may however be generalized under 
the following heads the superior value of its doc 
trines the holy rectitude of its moral precepts and 
the transcendent glory of its prospects 

the candid and intelligent reader will perceive 
at once from this brief statement regarding the evi 
dences of religion that a considerable portion of them 
rest upon human nature as their basis it would 
just be as irrational to deny the existence of the or 
dinary thoughts and emotions which pass through 
our minds as to deny the existence and influence of 
these religious principles with respect to diose 
doctrines of revelation which seem to u to be un 
supported by direct intimations from natural theology 
they stand upon other grounds of evidence such as 



on bbliaion 

follow from a proper estisiation of the supremacy of 
the deity and from the fact that in every revela 
tion from a creator to a created and finite being 
some things must of necesttty become to them in 
vested with a moral obligation to believe independent 
ly of any considerations whether such things accord 
with the suggestions of their reaiioi or not in sup 
port of such doctrines as are commonly said to be 
above reason human testimony also adds considerable 
weight 

the objections to religious truth arise st from 
the oijeets of this branch of knowledge being more 
distant from our observation than many other topics 
of speculation religious principles are not very 
palpable to intellectual vision they are hidden un 
derneath the materials of other departments of infor 
mation more immediately connected with the physi 
cal existence and wellbeing of the individual hu 
man nature must undergo a certain degree of culti 
vation in its bodily mental and moral capacities be 
fore rational religion can take root and flourish and 
as religious feelings and sentiments naturally spring 
up later in life than our other principles of know 



 on beligion 

ledge the former are more apt to be neglected or 
checked in their growth by the rank vegetation of the 
latter which have so far got the start g them 

 it is a very common remark but not the less 
true or the less important because common that more 
objections are urged against religion from the heart 
than the head religious restraints are more or less 
unpalatable to all men and this circumstance na 
turally prompts our minds to demand a fuller degree 
of evidence than we would otherwise do if such re 
straints were not against the general current of our 
natural propensities it would not be in accordance 
with strict truth to maintain that all persons who 
entertain scruples as to the insufficiency of religious 
evidence are preeminently wicked and depraved 
but truth compels us to make a remark which daily 
observation forces upon us that we very commonly 
find infidelity and a certain degree of moral latitudi 
narianism combined in one and the same individual 
a total disregard of religious principles and observ 
ances must have a withering and corrupting influence 
upon our moral affections and habits and when once 
these get into a disordered state they do by a natural 



on slioton 

sympathy exercise their influence upon e mind 
weakening and perverting the reasoning faculties 

 many persons nreate logical difficulties for 
themselves on religious topics £rom their absurd and 
extravagant demands as to he deee and kind of 
evidence they require to produce conviction in their 
minds they are often more unreasonable on this 
subject than on any other which comes under their 
notice they demand to have the objects of religion 
actually placed bore their eyes and every thing 
relating to them invested with the vivid realily 
which belongs to the objects of our external senses 
but hope there are few intelligent readers who will 
not have wisdom sufficient to guard themselves against 
such clumsy stumblingblocks in their reasonings on 
theological subjects 

 no inconsiderable portion of scepticism on re 
ligious subjects to be found in the world takes its 
rise from a supercilious contempt of and a total in 
difference to the arguments by which these subjects 
are supported people will not take the trouble to 
inquire and pass a hasty judgment of condemnation 
from the most trifling logical difficulties were 



 on helioion 

they to devote a little more time and patient reflee 
tion to the matter they would find themselves amply 
rewarded by such a full body of evidence as ought to 
satisfy all but the wilfully and perversely blind 
the evidences of natural and revealed telignm are 
innumerable and so diversified that their examina 
tion has given rise to some of the most splendid spe 
eimens of logical skill to be found in the records of 
human thought these evidences are at the same 
time considered individually perfect and independ 
ent in their own nature they resemble those little 
meandering rivulets which branch off in a thousand 
directions into remote and widely difierent regions 
but which when all united together form a foil and 
magnificent river rolling with majestic rapidity 
bearing down before it every opposing obstacle and 
imparting fertility and beauty to the surrounding 
country

chapter viii 

general remarks on the contents of the 
preceding chapters 

we have endeavoured to show in the preceding part 
of this work lo what subjects logic is to be applied it 
must appear evident from even the common language 
of mankind as well as from the nature of the thing 
itself that the higltest kinds of logical skill are limits 
ed to subjects connected with human nature these 
subjects agreeably to their obvious and common di 
vision we have attempted to elucidate in as brief and 
succihot a manner as possible 

a correct notion of the evidence which these dif 
ferent subjects affofd and the difficulties which are 
in some measure inseparable from their elucidation 
are indispensably necessary towatds framing any ra 
tmal system of logic it will be found of no use to 



 general remarks ok the 

lay down rules for the guidance of our reasoning fa 
culty either in the discovery of truth or in the com 
munication to others of the truth already known if 
correct ideas are not constantly kept before the mind 
as to the precise nature of the subjects which come 
under our investigation this is the keystone to 
every useful system of intellectual education if at 
tention be not paid to the inherent peculiarities of 
evidence which various departments of knowledge pos 
sess the formal rules of logic will only be employed 
to bewilder the mind and to propagate sophistry and 
error on the most vitally important subjects 

but it must be obvious that no specific or particu 
lar rules can be laid down to make us more readily 
acquainted with those different kinds and degrees of 
evidence which belong to each science and how far 
the consideration of these differences ought to influ 
ence our conclusions in these sciences this must 
always be a matter for the most patient and dispas 
sionate attention we must be at all times actuated 
by a sincere and ardent desire for truth and when 
this desire is joined to a moderate share of attention 
to the subject with which we wish to make ourselves 



contents op the pbecedin chaftebs 

acquainted we will not be disappointed in our ob 
ject 

there is however one remark i would subjoin 
here which if attended to will prove of use to the 
reader namely that we ought to accustom ourselves 
when considering subjects connected with human na 
ture to look as it were beyond the mere reason 
tng process in which we may be engaged it is quite 
possible that we may puzzle and bewilder ourselves 
and others by a too scrupulous attention to the pre 
cise forms of abstract reasoning this may perhaps 
appear paradoxical but we may find numerous in 
stances of the truth of the remark both in the history 
of philosophy and in common life we ought to 
suspect the soundness of any logical process if it run 
counter to some of the most general and obvious con 
clusions of the understanding or to the feelings and 
sentiments of the heart these general conclusions 
and sentiments ought to be our places of refuge 
against the wily and deceptive artifices of the mere 
quibbler and sophist 

we have considered these subjects of human na 
ture as constituting the materials so to speak on 



which logic is to operate in confonnity with this 
view of the matter we have placed the precedii 
chapt under the general divisim o part ftrat of 
this treatise because as we have already noticed we 
consider that without general knowledge of the topics 
for which iccal skill is principally desired the bare 
forip of the rules of that art can be of no possible 
utility but pay on the contrary be pojsitively mit 
ehievous agreeably to the plan laid down we come 
next to the second part of this work which professes 
to consider the instruments which we employ in the 
reasoning process to understand the nature and 
use of these instruments is of essential importance 
it is in fact to be acquainted with all that is or 
ever can be meant by a system of logic 



part ii 



 



chapter i 

on analysis and synthesis or induction 

in the second part of this work we propose to treat 
of two of the most important instruments in reason 
ing which men are led from the impulse of nature 
to use — analysis and induction 

by analysis we must understand the dividing and 
separating a general truth or proposition into its el 
mentary or component parts this is a mental pro 
cess carried on to a great extent by all men without 
their being in ordinary cases in the least degree con 
scious of its operation when a beautiail and exten 
sive landscape bursts suddenly upon our view the mind 
is taken up with the consideration of the whole taken 
together but after a certain time has elapsed we 
begin to examine the different parts of which thi 
landscape is composed to reflect upon and examine 



 on analysis and sltthbsis ob inbuction 

them and to apportion out to each individual part 
according to our knowledge and taste its due propor 
tion of influence in the general effect produced upon 
us we examine the landscape by piecemeal 
beginning in ordinary cases with the most impor 
tant parts and descending downwards in the scale of 
prominency till our observations have assumed a 
sufficient degree of minuteness to gratify the spirit 
of inquiry or to grasp the xximtsl object of wjiiicfa we 
are in search 

those who can attend to the operaios of their 
own minds will readily perceive vast use of this 
power of asalysis and hw necesafry ils cakivation 
and exercise axe to our making any progress in many 
important branchea of human knowledge referring 
again by way of iuustraiion to an ialteresting ht 
scape we know that the artist who cauu furnish us 
with a represedtation of it must he greatly ia 
debted to this power of analysis he musit oafe 
fully attend to the effects of the scene as a whole 
and yet he must u evry step of hi peorfonnane 
be carrying on a most accurate and idinute process of 
analytical division he must give to every part of

the landscape a prqper degree of attention the ge 
nera pecit is grasped as a whole by his mind and 
then it is paicued out axbong the rocks and prpmi 
neiiqes and wateius and woods and buildings c 
in suitable piportions according to the principles of 
art indeed it is to this habit of analyzing his 
ideas of the sublime and beautiful in external nature 
that he owes his skill for if he had no art to separ 
rate his general eonceptioos into their component 
peuts and apportion ou to each its suitable situation 
as to dimensions light dbade distance colour c 
his canvass would be one uniform representatioa of 
sbflfieless nonentities 

and th caaie is precisely the same with one who 
install of repvsenling a laadscpe on canvass pre 
sents jpx with a verbal description of it no general 
language caa possiuy convey to you the most distant 
cinjtiioii of the landscape till the describer desciends

jour view and the tremendous roar of le mountain 
torrent as it dashes from rock to rock there must 
be individuality embodied in every part of his descrip 
tion that it may be understood and relished by those 
to whom it is addressed and when the whde has 
been analyzed into sufficiently minute portions these 
are all summed up as it were by the mind and 
united into one general and uniform representation 

the same power of the mind we are here describ 
ing is called into active exercise in all the efforts 
made in the current literature of all civilized nationar 
to delineate human character in its various forms and 
aspects but here as in painting and descriptive 
writing general ideas must be resolved into their in 
dividual parts before our descriptions of eharacter can 
be rendered intelligible or in unison with nature 
in drawing a mental or moral portrait we must be 
gin with the leading and merecenspieuous traits of 
character and gradually descend to the more hidden 
and minute principles of action and passion filling 
up the sketch as we proceed with the little angular 
prominences and whimsacid eccentricities which di 
versify the wide and extended rangjs ef humad na

of thinking powers of mind moral principles pas

hand of a master if the description display a minute 
and skilful exercise of the power of analyzing we 
are never deceived in this matter but promptly pro 
nonnce the pcnrtrmt to be admirably drawn when 
all the parts which constitute the picture pass in re 
view before our minds and become invested with an 
evident unity of design and iqpearance 

in subjects of an abstract and prrfound nature

analysis would be too minute and carried beyond its 
legitimate boundaries again should a man when 
he wishes to make himself acquainted with a piece of 
machinery such for instance as the steamengine 
already referred to dwell with fastidious and scru 
rinizing minuteness on the nature configuration and 
properties of all the fibres of wood which compose the 
firamework of the machine or the grains of metal 
or the shape and number of the nails which have 
been employed in the construction of the boiler if 
in fact he were to attempt to analyze every thing re 
lating to the object of his inquiries he might so em 
ploy himsdf for a thousand years and be no nearer 
a correct understanding of the nature and power of 
the engine than the first day he commenced his in 
vestigations thus it appears that an unlimited ana 
lysis can lead to nothing but this power is wisely 
placed under the control of the judgment and 
while she occupies her supremacy the power of ana 
lysis is carried just to that point which is necessary 
to make us perceive the truth of the general proposi 
tions of which the mind is in search 

these two powers of analysis and synthesis enter 



on analysis and synthesis ob induction 

into every process of reasoning however limited or 
unimportant we are almost every moment of our 
lives employing them these operations however 
are frequently so subtle and rapid that it can only 
be from long attention to the inward workings of our 
own minds that a haut can be permanently formed 
of readily recognising their existence and influence 
upon our intellectual movements from the writings 
of logicians and metaphysicians the reader might be 
led to imagine that the analytic and inductive me 
thods of reasoning are purely matters of artj and only 
of very recent invention but this is a great mis 
take the division of our general conceptions or 
ideas into their component parts and the power of 
again uniting them into their former state of aggre 
gation are faculties intimately blended with the 
very earliest movements of the mind of man how 
ever rude or unenlightened it may be we recog 
nise the application of these intellectual instruments 
in the savage as well as in the philosopher as far as 
their respective degrees of knowledge require that ap 
plication 



 om analysis and tnth£ ob induction 

these remius will be sufficient to illustrate the 
analytic method of reasoning we come now to the 
synthetic loethod or that of induction we here re 
verse the order followed in analysis in seeking 
knowledge qx ourselves dr in communicating it to 
others by the synthetic plan we begin with the 
simple and elementary parts of which general truths 
or propositions are composed in abstract sdeocc 
we commence with intuitive or selfevident trutha or 
axioms and advance by regular steps upwards car 
rying evidence and conviction along with us so that 
at every interval of our reasoning we have a clear 
view of the ground which we have immediately gone 
qver and the reasons which at every point have 
cojmanded pur assent 

 in naturiil philoscqphy the inthetic method is 
generally adopted in making experiments and ob 
servations upon various objects we notice the result 
£nd by comparing apd judging we come to the 
knowledge of those quantities or properties of bodies 
which are common to many apparently different sub 
stances as we follow up this process we come to 



on amazvi an ynthesh induction 

geoeralise still more until we arrive at what we call 
the ultimate principlea of bodies or general lawa of 
nature 

what geially passes under the denomination of 
method is simply the exercise of these two powers of 
analysis and induction our allwise creator has as 
signed them a conspicuous place among our intellec 
tual principles there is in man a love of order and 
arrangement which manifests itself at a very early 
period of life at the first dawn of reason ere the 
mental powers have acquired almost any strength 
we find the young child begin to make selections of 
material objects and to arrange and classify them ac 
cording to a particular standard fixed in his mind as 
to colour size c some faint traces of this power 
are discernible in the inferior creation but it is 
vastly preeminent in man it gradually develops 
itself as he advances to manhood enables him to 
divide and methodize his thoughts and sentiments 
and becomes of vital importance in the proper dis 
charge of these numerous duties which fall to his lot 
to perform 

neither analysis nor induction viewed singly can 



 on analysis and synthesis ob induction 

be regarded as instruments either for the discovery or 
promulgation of truth another power is absolutely 
necessary — that of analogy and to it therefore we 
shall call the attention of the reader in the succeed 
ing chapter 



 



chapter ii 



on analogy 



we have in the preceding chapter pointed out at 
some length the importance of the two operations of 
the mind called analysis and synthesis but we 
must here observe that these faculties would be of 
very little use to us if we did not possess the power 
of reasoning from analogy if we required to analyze 
every object which came before us and to resolve it 
into its general principles before we could pronounce 
with certainty any thing respecting it our actual 
knowledge would be exceedingly circumscribed indeed 
here however another operation of the mind is 
brought into play which relieves us from an incon 
ceivable degree of trouble enlarges our knowledge 
and expands our reasoning powers to an almost inde 
finite extent this process is analogy if we ana 



 on analogy 

lyze a portion of matter into its elementary parts we 
firmly believe that another possessing the same ex 
ternal appearances as the former is composed of like 
materials if we see a man following a certain line 
of conduct and bringing upon himself and others 
poverty and disease we immediately draw the con 
clusion that the like will happen to others if they 
tread in the same steps in these respective instances 
we do not institute an inquiry into every individual 
object upon which we reason and decide but we 
dfaw our conclusions from what we have actually ex 
perienced and apply them to objects of a similar 
nature which we may nevertheless never have sub 
mitted to personal examination 

the term analogy is generally used both ih com 
mon language and in systems of logio and philosophy 
to denote a certain degree of relation agreement or 
resemblance in some points between two or more 
objects whidh in other respects have little in common 
or possess altogether different properties or qualities 
it must be obvious from the immense variety of the 
works of creation that the objects which bear a rela 
tion or resemblance to one another must be numerous 



on analcmiy 

beyond the possibility of calculation and we will find 
that analogy or resemblance is of every degree from 
nearly complete identity to direct opposition or con 
trariety 

a great portion of the reasoning of mankind is 
founded upon analogy it is in constant and univer 
sal use and is employed alike by the rustic and the 
philosopher it is one of those instrunients which 
the almighty has placed in our hands to secure our 
comfcbtt and wdfare and to develop for our infbrma 
tion the laws of nature but like all other gifts from 
the same munificent soinrce it requires to be judici 
ously applied to the proper and legitimate purposes 
for which it was given 

in almost every department of human knowledge 
analogical reasonings are employed to a great extent 
and are found to be of great utility in the science 
of comparative anatomy for example it is of singu 
lar importance to trace out the resemblances between 
the structures of different animals their organs of 
sensation digestion and motion and from this ana 
logical inquiry we may draw useful conclusions for 
the government of our own conduct and constitution 



 on analogy 

and the promotion of our interests for example 
we make experiments with certain kinds of food on 
the digestive organs of dogs and from these we infer or 
draw concluaums that such and such effects will re 
sult to ourselves from taking these same kinds of 
food and these experiments have often led to the 
formation of rules of diet and remen of considerable 
importance to our bodily health many highly 
beneficial discoveries in medicine may be traced to 
experiments and observations made upon the inferior 
animals founded upon the resemblance between their 
functions of life and our own 

in chemical wience we may perceive the wonderful 
effects produced by the operation of the principle of 
analogy many of the most splendid and important 
discoveries in this science were the result of analogi 
cal reasonings it was from this source that dr 
priestley proved the compound nature of atmospheric 
air and it is related that it was in consequence of 
hints which he had given when on a visit to paris 
to lavoisier founded entirely upon analogical con 
jectures that the latter philosopher was induced to 

commence experiments with the view of proving the 

 



on analogt 

compound natuie of water and of ledueing it to its 
constituent elements indeed the whole hifirtory of 
tus veiy important and useful dartment of human 
knowkdge exhibits very striking and incontestable 
jptoobj how much of the art owed its existence to 
mere hints and conjeetures founded in many cases 
upon very slight resemblances or analogies 

in the science of astronomy we find that analogy 
hut been die prinepal instrument in conducting us 
to important disooveries and improvements the law 
of gravitation as unlblded by sir isaac newton was 
discovered by a train of anabgieal reasoning founded 
on one of the bmt triflkig circumstances which daily 
present themselves to our notice while sir isaac 
sat ruminating under a tree in his garden an apple 
happened to drop from it and hit him on tl head 
he conceived that the same law which determined 
the of the ae might possiuy be that which 
moved the heavenly bodies in theif orbits this led 
to infuiry and inquiry ended in a hll and settled 
qovictiait that the law which regulates the motion 
of terrestrial bodies is the same which regulates the 
movements of the sun moon and whole planetary 



 on analogy 

system and it is by observing the motions of the 
planets which belong to our solar system and by 
comparing their annual and diurnal motions with the 
corresponding motions of the earth that we come to 
the wellgrounded conclusion that these planets are 
the habitations of various orders of living beings for 
we are confident that the sun imparts both kght and 
heat to the planets as well as to our globe and a his 
influence gives birth to the various animated beings 
with which we are conversant analogy says la 
place induces us to believe that his influence pro 
duces similar effects on the planets for it is not na 
tural to suppose that matter of which we see the 
fecundity develop itself in such various ways should 
be sterile upon a planet so large as jupiter which 
like the earth has its days its nights and its years 
and on which observation discovers changes that indi 
cate very active forces man formed for the temper 
ature which he enjoys upon earth could not accord 
ing to all appearance live upon the other planets 
but ought there not to be a diversity of organization 
suited to the various temperatures of the globes of 
this universe if the difference of elements and 



on analogy 

climalies cause such variety in the productions of the 
earth how infinitely diversified must be the produc 
tions of the planets and their satellites the most 
active imagination cannot form any just idea of them 
but still their existence is extremely probable 

it would be impossible in this chapter to advert to 
all the advantages which analogical reasoning has 
conferred and is daily conferring upon science but 
these advantages are not exclusively confined to mat 
ters of abstract speculation they influence us also to 
a wonderful extent even in our common and every 
day occupations opinions and language nearly 
the whole of our knowledge of human nature is found 
ed upon analogy though it is commonly but very 
erroneously attributed to experience we conclude 
that any given line of conduct will be pleasant or dis 
agreeable to our fellowmen merely because we con 
ceive them to be of a similar construction with our 
selves in body mind and moral feelings when we 
confer benefits upon our neighbour we conceive that he 
will feel grateful because we presume that his nature is 
similar to our own and for the same reason when we 
inflict an injury upon him we conceive that he will feel 



 on analogy 

and express indignation the food which i palatable 
and nourishing to us or that which is unpleasant and 
pernicious we know will produce like eiects upm 
other people solely because we gvound our conclu 
sions upon the analogical hypothesis that theie k a 
perfect similarity among au men in the orgaas of di 
gestim and general powers of hfe 

the whok structure of metaphorical language is 
grounded on the resemblance or analogy which the 
imagination conceives to exist amg difievent ob 
jects we say diat virtue is fair and beautiful that the 
mind is strong and robust active and livdy jnrecisely 
because we omccive there is somediing in the moral 
and mental qualifications analogous to mattfial 
objects which we dothe with these attributes me 
taphmcal expressions will always be found moat nu 
merous in the writings of those authors who are led 
from the habita of their minds into extensive compa 
risons and a minute examination of the works of na 
ture the poet is a welucnown instance of this 
it i firom metaphors and nmiles that a gfeat deid of 
the pleasure whidi poetry aibrda us is derived we 
clothe the objects of nature both animate and inani 



on analoot 

mate with various properties aad attributes but all 
these must in true poetry bt fouuded upon some real 
or apparau analogy or resctnblanoe otherwise we de 
rive no pleasure from poetical metaphm but on 
the codtnnry nothing so readily disgusts us and puts 
us out of humour with our author as when his si 
miles and metaphors do not suggest to our minds 
some natural or fancied resemblance to the objects 
whiefa they ar designed to represent 

but though analogy is one of the most powerful 
and geneiml operations to which the mind resorts and 
the exnsise of it seems indispensable to our com 
ohy nay to our very existence yet it is not placed be 
yond the reach of misapjication analogy ftequently 
leads us into gross ertoth both in speculation and 
praetiee and we ought at all times in using it to 
exetvise a vighant circumspection over all conclusions 
which seem to rest exclusively on analogical reascm 
ings and more especially if these conclusions in 
volve sulijects of deep interest to our present or fu 
ture wellbeing were we able in the majority of 
oases to trace the remote or hidden springs of those 
actions which hurry the unthinking and profligate part 



 on analogy 

of mankind to a eonrse of life destructive of thenr 
virtue their comfort and existence we would find 
that agreat part of their misfchrtunes might be fairly 
attributed to erroneous or fenciful analogies or mis 
calculations as to the effects of any given line of coii 
duct 

in our abstract and speculative opinions we are 
also greatly affected by erroneous or doubtiul resem 
blances and no one can take up a book on controver 
sial topics of any description without noticing that 
the differences of opinion may in nine cases out of 
ten be attributable to some false analogies incidentally 
introduced as it were into the discussion and made 
the groundwork of the whole matter of dispute to 
give an example of this kind of influence on our spe 
culative conclusions arising from erroneous analogies 
will perhaps prove more strikingly illustrative of the 
truth of these remarks than any general observations 
which could be made upon the subject the quotation 
i am about to give relates to the long and keenly 
contested question on liberty and necessity and the 
 extract is the more valuable as having come from the 
pen of a very able and accomplished american writer 



on analogy 

the reverend jonathan edwaxds of course it would 
be altogether out of place here to express any opinion 
on the questions under dispute it is simply our 
duty to notice how false analogies may impose upon 
the strongest minds and vitiate a long chain of close 
and argumentative reasoning there is a vast 
di£perence says he between the suns being the 
cause of the lightsomeness and warmth of the atmo 
sphere and the brightness of gold and diamonds by 
its presence and positive influence and its being the 
occasion of darkness and frost in the night by its mo 
 tion wheray it descends below the horizon if 
the sun were the proper cause of cold and darkness 
it would be the fountain of these things as it is ike 
fountain of light and heat and then something 
might be argued from the nature of cold and dark 
ness to a likeness of nature in the sun and it might 
 be justly inferred that the sun itself is dark and cold 
and that his beams are black and frosty but from 
 its being the cause no otherwise than by its depar 
ture no such thing can be inferred but the contrary 
it may justly be argued that the sun is a bright and 
hot body if cold and darkness are found to be the 



 on analogy 

canseqtieroe i£ its witiidnivttet and tiio mere eoa 
btantlj and aeeessairily those eceets fe eeonmed wkh 
and eoaiifiod to its abeence tiie mcnre amily does it 
argue tiie sun to be the fimntaia of lt and beat 
 inasmudi as nn is not the fintit of any positive 
ageney oir influence of the most higb butt on the 
oontraiy arises frcon die withhdiding of his aotion 
and energy and under eertain eiieamstanees neeeo 
sarily follows on the want his influenee this 
no argument that he is sinfnl or his operation evq 
but on the contrary that he and his ageney are al 
together good and holy and that he is the fountain 
of all holiness it would be strange arguing uideed 
tet because men never commit sin but only when 
ood leaves them to themselves and necessarily sin when 
he does so their sin therefore is not from themselves 
but from od and so ood must be a sinftil being as 
strange as it would be to lurgue that because it is al 
ways daric when the sun is gone and never dark when 
the sun is present au rkness therefore is finm the 
sun and his disk and beams must needs be uadc 

now the whole of this aigument from analogy 
is founded upon the assumed principle that there is 



on analogy 

 a rtsemuance of the sun r created and dependent ob 
jeet to the almighty ereator of that same object and 
of every thing dse but a mementos consideration 
will convioee ust that there can really be no resem 
blance between the princie on which the movements 
and energies of a dependent creature rest and the prin 
ciple on which depends the active power of the being 
who made that creature the two olqects have no 
thing in common that is the sun wants the essen 
tial attributes of fmoium wt and intelligence 
which must be considered as inherent qualities in the 
divine nature 

we cannot fail to view with wander and admira 
tion that subtile power of mind which in geneiml 
esses balances so nicely and promptly too the dif 
icrent degrees of evidence which result from different 
degrees of analogy existing among various olgects 
where the iinalqgy ox resemblance between two or 
more objects is almost perfect the mind readily and 
upim the spur of the moment reasons upon both 
and draws nmilar ccmclusions from them and when 
this analogy or resemblance becomes inter and 
more imperceptible then we advance in our reason 



 on analogy 

ing with more hesitation and our eonchisions are en 
compassed with a greater portion of doubt and ui 
certainty how surprising is this power of the mind 
and how subtile and dexterous its movements 

now looking at the great importance of analog 
both as it influenees our abstract and speculative 
principles and reasonings and as it bears upon oisr 
practical conduct we ought to be perpetually upon 
our guard to employ this mighty engine in a proper 
manner in this consists the greater part of thftt 
which generally goes under the denomination of 
judgment let us be cautious in drawing analogi 
cal inferences and conclusions from certain sets of 
lacts or circumstances which are not in all particulars 
alike it is from the neglect of this precaution that 
we are so frequently involved in difficulties and per 
plexities in our reasonings and are thus led into 
error on many important subjects in all our specu 
lations we will do welt to keep this precaution steadily 
in our minds eye and we will thereby be prevented 
from fiihing into many mistakes of moment to us 
both as it regards our abstract principles and owe 
actual comfort and happiness 



 



chapter iii 



on probable evidence 



the evidence derived from probability is in many 
cases precisely the same as that obtained from ana 
logy of which we have already treated in the pre 
ceding chapter we say such and such a thing will 
probably happen when there is a resemblance or ap 
parent identity of circumstances in both instances 
that portion of the evidence of probability which 
assimilates itself to analogy depends upon the prin 
ciple that nature is uniform in all her operations 
and that like causes will produce like effects 

it is better however to keep the evidence obtain 
ed from probability distinct from that derived from 
analogy though in a variety of cases the former 
seems identical with the latter probability when 
applied to mathematics is quite distinct from analogy 
and constitutes a separate division of that science 



 on pbobabis evideingk 

which goes under the denomination of the doctrine 
of chances this is a department of human know 
ledge exceedingly interesting and useful but the 
principle on which this kind of probability rests 
cannot be applied to our reasonings on topics eonnect 
ed with human nature it ean therefore be of no 
service to enlarge upon this species of mathematical 
evidence seeing that its rules are not susceptible of 
any applkation to sulijects of a different nature 

in usix the woid prdbmlityf as synonymous with 
analogy we may say fir example that our whole 
moral conduct is rulated by the rules and piinci 
jdes of probable evidence we labour for fixid and 
clothes without being assured that we shall live to 
enjoy them and when we do obtain them we use 
them without being previously assured that they 
will prove beneficial to us we enter into great 
and important undertakings without having any other 
assurance that they will prove advantageous than 
that which probability furnishes and we rear and 
edueate our offspring with the hope iriiieh pro 
bability inspires that they will outlive us and may 
perhaps be of assistance to us in the season of need 



 



chapter iv 



on testimony 



we have seen in the preceding chapters the neces 
sity and use of analysis synthesis analogy and pro 
bability both for abridging our labour and guiding 
us to truth but all these instruments oi reasoning 
would be of very limited utility unless they were 
used in conjunction with another namely human 
testimony this lessens our mental labour in a won 
derful degree we rely with perfect confidence on 
the statement of credible persons in reference to cir 
cumstances and events which happened at times 
and places far removed from the limits of our own 
personal experience the evidence derived from it 
enters largely into the greater part nay forms al 
most th entire mass of information which can be ac 
quired in the wide range of human inquiry 



 on testimony 

the rules and principles of evidence arising from 
human testimony are so numerous and of such vast 
importance when viewed in relation to other subjects 
that they constitute of themselves a considerable 
branch of human knowledge and the examination 
and application of these rules and principles give rise 
to some of the most splendid and powerful exhibitions 
of reasoning looking then at the magnitude and 
vitally interesting nature of this subject a full and 
complete outline of it cannot be expected to be given 
here neither would this be of any use if it could 
be accomplished all that can be done is to impress 
upon the readcrs attention the importance of testi 
mony and to offer a few observations which may in 
some measure assist him in his general reasonings on 
the subject 

all evidence which arises from human testimony 
is made up of two ingredients the reasonableness of 
the matter or thing related and the character of the 
witnesses by whom it is related 

in considering the testimony in favour of any fact 
or occurrence we are naturally led by a strong prin 
ciple in our nature to look narrowly at the reasona 



on teotimony ill 

bleness or probability of such a ct or occurrence 
and to rulate our belief in either by conclusicms 
drawn from our everyday experience of what falu 
under our own personal observation if the fact re 
lated be in itself impossible then no degree of testi 
naony can ever establish it as a truth to the satisc 
tion of our minds 

but the principle here laid down that our own 
experience modifies or regulates our belief has by 
some writers of credit been called in questicm for 
they have maintained that our reliance upon human 
testimony is most complete when our experience is 
least and this it is said is evinced by the fact that 
children whose experience is very limited believe 
any thing you tell them but this is something like 
a quibble there are two kinds of belief implicit 
and rational belief the fact is established beyond 
all controversy that our rational belief in every thii 
founded upon human testimony is vastly influenced 
by our experience and that it is among people who 
have the least knowledge of the world or of mankind 
that the most perfect specimens of implicit faith are 
to be found 



 on testmony 

we must however be carem not to lay too mudi 
stress upon this priuciple if we were to believe 
nothing but what is in accordance with our own 
personal experience our knowledge would be extreme 
ly limited indeed we ought to acknowledge the 
existence of that jnciple in our nature which sens 
with the force and rapidity of instinct to examine a 
statement of facts grounded upon human teatimony 
but at the same time it is our duty to acquire the 
habit of making a right application of it in the many 
important affairs of life 

the leading points for the guidance o the under 
standing in matters of testimony are the following 
namely whether ae pmrsona relating the facts or 
circumstances to be believed bxe possessed of powers 
of mind capable of perceiving the truth whether 
they were eye or earwitnesses of what they relate 
whether the narmtors are honest aidifial and un 
prejudiced persons whether their testimony is cor 
roborated by other persons worthy of ciedit whether 
the fiuts or ciicumstances lay exposed to open in 
vestigauon at the time they todc place whether the 
witnesses betray an indiscreet zeal for the establish 



on testmony 

ment of their story or bring forth just as much evi 
dence as will exactly suit the matters affirmed to be 
true whether there be an outward visible appearance 
of honesty and simplicity of mind about them 
whether the narrators belong to different nations 
sects and situations in life and lastly whether the 
other little incidental circumstances commonly con 
nected with the relation of the main facts be of such 
a chamcter as not to throw any doubt over the te 
ttmony of the witnesses 

but all logical rules relative to human testimony 
must necessarily be of a yty general and imperfect 
description rational evidence derived from this 
source depends upon numerous minute circumstances 
which elude all our powers of generauiation the 
reader ought to consult some good treatise on evi 
denee and if possible to make himself acquainted 
widi tiie leading rules relative to testimony laid 
down by writers on civil and criminal law these 
will pvove of vast importance to him even on many 
topics which may apparently be lemoved from the 
subjects of judicial investigations 



 



chapter v 



on lianouage 



language is intimately connected with the reason 
ing faculties indeed of so much importance has 
the right use and proper definition of words appeared 
to many logicians that they have considered all 
sound reasoning to be grounded upon them how 
far this opinion is correct will be shown in the sub 
sequent parts of this chapter 

words of some description or other are used by 
all mankind and are to be viewed in two different 
lights st to represent their own individual 
thoughts and d to convey ideas to others a 
correct definition of our terms is of vital importance 
in our communications with our fellowmen for 
though we may use words to represent our ideas to 
ourselves according to any plan we think proper yet 



on language 

when we come to reason with and discourse to others 
we must pay the most scrupulous attention to those 
verbal or written signs conventionally agreed upon 
in the language which we employ in order that we 
may convey to them an accurate representation of our 
conceptions feelings and sentiments 

some writers on logic have given numerous and 
minute directions relative to the definition of our ge 
neral terms of reasoning but the benefits to be de 
rived from a close attention to these directions will 
not i am afraid prove of great importance it is 
however necessary that the reader should have his 
mind deeply impressed with the importance of gene 
ral definition and for that end a few remarks will 
be made to point out where this alleged importance 
is founded and to aid the suggestion to the mind of 
those practical rules which will in some measure 
enable us to avoid glaring errors of judgment by the 
use of improper words 

if we do not learn to contract a habit in our gene 
ral reasonings of examining very scrupulously the 
precise meaning of words we hall run the risk of be 
ing plunged into fallacies at almost every step in 



 on tanottaail 

the greater number of subjects connected ivith human 
nature iiiete are certain common terms used the 
meaning of which ought to be carefully determined 
before we can safely come to a conclusion respecting 
the proposition before us the substance of the 
usual directions of logicians on this subject may be 
comptefaended under the following heads 

ist we must be careful not to make use of words 
which have no ideas attached to them all writers 
are occasionally under the temptation to fill up a 
sentence cnr end a paragraph with words to which 
they have no definite conceptions attached this 
happens more frequently in argumentative pieces of 
writing than in statements composed of mere mat 
ters of fact the reader is thus apt to be led to ima 
gine that he understands the subject under consider 
ation when in reality he is ignorant it in all 
systems of philosophy and religion both andent and 
modem we find abundant reason to be perpetually 
on our guard against the ambiguities of words and 
it not unfrequently happens that in proportion to 
the length of time that particular technical jdirases 
have passed current among the learned the difficulty 



on lanoab 

o£ affixing to such phrases concise and accurate ideas 
is to a great extent augmented 

sd there are many objects the essence or nature 
©f which is identically or nearly the same which have 
h€weyer different terms attached to them not at 
tending to this consideration may involve us in 
matiy important errors in our reasonings the ap 
plication of common terms to a variety of ohjects is a 
contrivance of the mind exceedingly useful to a cer 
tain extent requiring however on very intricate 
and interesting subjects of thought to be used with 
great caution many violent and longcontinued 
disputes among the learned have taken their rise from 
this source 

d another error in reasoning arises from a cause 
precisely the opposite of that last mentioned namely 
sujosing the nature or essence of two or m objects 
to be precisely the same because they have the same 
tmds affixed to thm the fallacies c judgment 
which flow from this source are as numerous as se 
which flow from the preceding 

though a conect dcfinin of words be of vital 
ibiportanee in our general oouzie tf reasmui we 



 on language 

must be particularly careful not to overstep the legi 
timate boundaries of verbal criticism that we 
may become habituated to a sound and effective em 
ployment of our reasoning powers we ought at all 
times to evince an anxious desire to make ourselves 
more acquainted with the ideas or mental concep 
tions involved in any proposition than lirith the 
exact meaning of the words in which that proposition 
may be couched there is not a more disingenuous 
and untisfactory method of reasoning than for a 
disputant to endeavour to escape from the force of the 
arguments urged by his antagonist by taking shelter 
under a captious demand for verbal definition men 
would never grow any wiser if there were not some 
limits made to definition by the native good sense 
and candour of mankind in such a simple proposi 
tion for example as virtue is honourable a man may 
be puzzled by a demand for verbal definition till 
he is at a loss to know either what he is saying or 
thinking 

we ought always to look upon definition as a two 
edged instrument capable of cutting both ways 
when judiciously managed it is of the greatest im 



on lanouae 

portance in our general reasonings but its misappli 
cation will prove equally injurious to our progress in 
truth whatever branch of knowledge we are cultivat 
ing nor can there be any definite or infallible 
rules laid down for the regulation of the understand 
ing in its use of words this is evidently beyond the 
reach of any system of logic whatever all that can 
be done is to ornish the mind with a few very gene 
ral hints on the importance of attending to the mean 
ing of words and then to leave the rest to the natu 
ral operation of the mind itself the inherent power 
in our intellectual nature of making a right applica 
tion of words is very strong when not weakened or 
misdirected by false or too refined principles of verbal 
criticism of the abstract nature of this power we 
know nothing nor would it perhaps be of much 
consequence to the right management of our reason 
ing faculties if we did we are guided on this as 
on many other occasions by the unerring hand of in 
finite wisdom manifested in the peculiar structure of 
our minds 

to remedy the defects of language as an instru 
ment of reasoning by a system of logic two things 



 on langvagb 

would require to be aecomplished namely that we 
should always when called upon for a defimtioii of 
our terms be aue to csaploy such explamtery words 
as would be altogether removed from the slightest am 
biguity and seeondly that we should prove both 
when and how to enter into a rigid examinatiim of 
the ideas attached to the terms of which any given 
prqtion is composed but tliese objects in aw 
absolute ferm are perfectly unattainable no words 
ate used to plain or qualify tibe meaning o£ others 
that are not diemselves as liable to ambiguity as the 
words to be exjained and aa to any rules of kgic 
capable of instructing us when we are to call for ver 
bal deflnltioas and when not the thought is pcscfiect 
ly chimerical as we have tdxeady said all that can 
be done in this ease must be limited to mere general 
hints and easual observations no rule can be fiam 
ed to ow us when wb are to give a definition or 
when to demasid one fisom those with whom we are 
reasoniii this must be left to our own gosd sense 
and candour we heartily despise the nwm in an 
intellectual point of view who shuts his em against 
a rational appeal to his understandmg semj because 



iftiere may be some deviation in the speaks knguage 
from the authorized mode of pronunciation so in 
like manner ought we to lightly esteem the person 
who wishes to entangle us at every step of our rea 
soning by demanding captious and trifling verbal 
definitions the one habit is just as indicative of a 
little and narrow mind as the other and both habits 
must effectually destroy that candid and dispassion 
ate frame of mind on which our progress in real 
wisdom vitally depends 

that theory must appear totally untenable i con 
ceive even to the most superficial inquirer which 
maintains that words and words alone are the ele 
ments with which reason is conversant let us take 
for example the simple affirmation that john is an 
gry what does this mean do not all mankind 
know what is meant by this proposition the moment 
it is enunciated but let a person call for a defini 
tion of anger and there will arise in a moment abun 
dant matter for interminable disputes anger is de 
fined by one lexicographer as an uneasiness upon 
receipt of injury by another the effect of un 
meriied provocation are we any wiser by these 



 on ulnovage 

definitions considered as mere definttums f not in 
the slightest dee now suppose in our great 
anxjr for excessive perspicuity that we call in a 
philosopher who is generally allowed to be £ supe 
rior to a mere compiler of words and see how he will 
explain anger he will tell you that anger is an 
emotion of instant displeasure which arises firmn the 
feeling of injury done or the discovery of injury in 
tended or in many cases from the discovery of the 
mere omission of good offices to which we conceived 
ourselves entitled though this very omission may of 
itself be regarded as a species of injury have 
we gained any thing by this philosophical definition 
of anger i am afraid not but suppose there still 
remained notwithstanding this strenuous endeavour 
ip attain verbal accuracy a desire to question the 
truth of the position that john is angry here 
are provided ample materials for lengthened discus 
sion we might ask what is an emotion what is 
meant by imtant and dispkaaure and omustoai and 
ood offices and species and injury and many other

terms mploed in this philosophical definition of 
anger in fact we might thus persist in defining 
 for a century and get no farther than the point from 
which we set out we may clearly see by this ex 
ample how totally insufficient are all mere definitions 
of general terms to satisfy the mind when it either 
will not or cannot attend the thing signified 

let us however take another example firom a 
comnoon piece of colloquial language which nobody 
would think involved any ambiguity from the mere 
words in which it is couched how do you do to 
day pretty well i thank you suppose that 
the answerer to this question were further interro 
gated as to what he meant by being pretty well 
he would tell you that he was in tery good htalik 
but what is good health f there have been many 
discussions on this point and it has hitherto proved 
as difficult for medical men to point out the precise 
and infallible symptoms of perfect healthy as it has 
been for metaphysicians to define the abstract nature 
of truth but let us lode at the matter according to 
the strict rule of verbal definition health is de 
fined by one writer to be soundness of body 



 on language 

and by another freedom from sickness we may 
not rest satisfied with these definitions and may 
possibly think of resorting for information to a phy 
sician who is engaged in constant endeavours to re 
store people to this state called health and surely 
we may reasonably presume that he will tell us what 
health is well then we ask him and he informs 
us with minute and scientific precision that as 
long as the various functions of the human body the 
voluntary as well as the involuntary motions are 
performed with ease and sufier no interruption we 
usually pronounce it in a state of health in the con 
trary case we call it diseased i shall advance a step 
farther and assert that when we do not feel ourselves 
encumbered with the weight of our own frame and 
when we are not disposed to reflect with uneasiness 
and solicitude upon its physical condition then we 
have a right to consider our health as being in a per 
fect statej are our scruples arising from the im 
perfections of language removed by this definition 
many will be inclined to consider that we might as

 pretty well i thank you sir 

hence arises the inutility for purposes of general 
reasoning of all refined etymological speculations on 
language such for instance as those of mr home 
tooke and others as matters of curiosity they 
may be tolerated but for guiding the mind in a ju 
dicious logical definition and arrangement of lan 
guage they are manifestly insufficient nay it 
would not be affirming too much to maintain that 
both theory and fact go to prove that such specula 
tions weaken the judgment and greatly circumscribe 
its expansive power an enthusiastic etymologist 
scrutinizes an argument like a traveller with micro 
scopic eyes where the inequalities of the ground he 
treads upon are magnified into yawning caverns and 
the motes that flutter in the sunbeams into lofty 
mountains 

some logicians have given us catalogues of parti 
cular words of an ambiguous nature used in several 
branches of knowledge with the view of assisting us 
in avoiding fallacies in reasoning but these cata 
logues only point out the general insufficiency of all

and the necessity of directing our minds eye cm all 
oocasicms to the ideas for which tbej stand with 
oat this precaution all formal rules of definitihi will

words employed in every branch of human inquiry 
will be found if the principles of veibal desnition be

chapter vi 

gknekal kemarks os the five preceding 
chafteb 

the contents of the five foregoing chapters are in 
tended to make us familiar with the kind of instru 
ments we employ in reasoning these instruments 
are aimished to us by nature they are principles of 
our minds distinctly and accurately defined in all 
kinds and degrees of reasoning we make use of them 
the frequency with which each instrument respec 
tively is handled depends upon the nature of the 
argumentative process joined to the relative strength 
and useiulness of the different powers arising either 
from their original nature or from mental cultivation 
to have an accurate knowledge then of these in 
struments their nature and use is an indispensable 
qualification for general reasoning but such know 



 genkrai bbkarks on the 

ledge is only useful for this end when employed in 
conjunction with a knowledge of the subjects on 
which these instruments are to be used a know 
ledge of the instruments and a knowledge of the 
materials on which they are to operate act and react 
upon one another their proper and judicious man 
agement is what goes under the denomination of 
sound and comprehensive reasoning the variou 
proportions in which these two kinds of knowledge 
are blended in ratiocination constitute that almost 
infinite variety of mental character which we see 
developed everywhere around ns 

we have already hinted in considering these ele 
mentary principles of reasoning that no preeise or 
in£eillitde rules can be devised to ow the reader how 
to employ these instruments of reasoning or where 
he is to use one particular instrument and where an 
other this must be a matter to be left entirely to 
the native powers of the mind itself aided hy general 
rules r their cultivation 

in taking a retrospective view of the preceding 
chapters in the second part of this work we cannot 
fail to perceive that the process of reasoning is very 



five pkbcedino chapters 

complex it reqmres the agency of many separate 
powers for its completion first we have simple 
perception then we have abstraction or the consider 
ation of the general proposition apart from other ob 
jects we have next the very subtile and refined 
processes of analysis and synthesis analogy and 
probability sometimes precede and sometimes follow 
these we require to fix in our minds not only the 
meaning of our own language but the language in 
which the proposition under notice may be couched 
then come nice calculations regarding the evidence 
of testimony many other ingredients go towards 
comprising a process of reasoning but those which 
we have enumerated are the principal how won 
derful does all this appear to us the rapidity of 
our mental operations exceeds all human conception 
or calculation we here and there obtain a glance 
of the internal structure of our inward principle of 
thought but it is only to make us feel the truth of 
the scriptural declaration that we are fearfully and 
wonderfully made 

but the wisdom displayed in this our mental con 
stitution is not less wonderful than its mechanism

had the operations of reasoning been slower than 
they are our stodc of knowledge woidd have beeo 
greatly diminished and the geoeial firamework of 
our physical and mental systems would have been 
completely deranged cobsideiing how extensite 
nay almost bomidless the field of knowledge is and 
how inadequate the longest life and the most exalted 
intelleetual endowments to explore all its parts and 
define its limits we see a peculiar fitness in omr lea 
soning powers being exerted with great promptitade 
and imerring effect our very existence also depends 
npon the wisdom of this providential anrangcinebt 
for we are often placed in circumstances which reqmre 
for our safety the examination of premises and the 
drawing of conclusions with the seeming rapidity of 
kghtning sndi operations elude all our attempts 
at any thing like a minute examination and we must 
 content ourselves with acquiescing in the sentiment 
of the psalmist that such knowledge is too wen

chapter i 



on syllogisms 



the third principal division cs this work embraces 
what has been considered as the mechanical part of 
logic many writers have maintained that this is 
the only subject which with propriety can be called 
logic while others again have considered it only in 
reference to its practical efficacy in guiding and 
strengthening our general powers of reasoning 

without entering into any controversy on this sub 
ject i venture to obseive that there is a clear and 
palpable distinction in the nature of things between 
the natural instruments we use in reasoning pointed 
out i the preceding part of this volume and those 
rules of art which have been framed with the view of 
affording in some measure at least a test or stan 
dard of the right application of these purely mental 



 on syllogisms 

instruments of ratiocination this distinction if 
kept distinctly before the mind of the reader will not 
only enable him to conduct his reasonings on most 
topics with additional accuracy and vigour but also 
to extract many useail hints from various treatises on 
logic which have been framed upon the pure princi 
pies of mechanical art 

in accordance with our plan we come now to a 
part of logic which has produced more keen disputes 
than any other the nature and advantages of syllo 
gisms this mode of treating of general reasoning 
was invented it is commonly affirmed by aristotle 
it is to be found in his analytics or treatise on 
logic a work which regulated the opinions of the 
learned for nearly two thousand years the whole of 
his theory of reasoning is founded upon his ten cote 
gartes or classes of subjects which comprehend ac 
cording to his conception every conceivable object of 
knowledge in the obtaining of which reason is em 
ployed from the celebrity which these ten catego 
ries have obtained and from the frequent references 
made to them in books of science both ancient and 
modem we shall simply enumerate them without

comfinrt ai convenience such as to be clothed to

leaving the ten categories to the consideration of 
the reader we shall now make a few remarks upon 
the syllogism in doing thi however all that is 
here intended is jirsty to make a few observations 
upon that process of reasoning which gives rise to the 
syllogism — tecondly to show the reader some of the 
different kinds of syllogisms and thirdly to give a 
brief statement of the advantages arising from a know 
ledge and application of the syllogistic theory 

the process of reasoning has by some logicians 
been looked upon as simply a process of comparison 
when we compare two things of dissimilar qualities 
together we cannot affirm or do any thing respecting 
them without endeavouring to find some interme 
diate ideas to reconcile as it were to the mind these 
dissimilar or contrary qualities but it may be 
asked by what process is this effected and how do 
these intermediate ideas come to discover the rela 
tions of things qs an incongruous and opposite na 
ture no rational answer can be given to these 



 on stiilogtsms 

questions except this that such is the coistittttun of 
our nature that when two ideas are presented to our 
attention from whieh no reasoning condnsion can be 
adduced it so happens that when one or more inter 
mediate ideas are presented to our minds and con 
templated by them in conjunction with the other two 
ideas we instantaneously asit were draw a logical 
inference from the whole 

it is from this cause that these writers who have 
argued in favour of the use of syllogisms have founded 
their doctrine on the principle that every act of rea 
soning assumes the form of a syllogism they con 
sider reasoning to be merely an operation of the mind 
which deducts some unknown propositions from other 
propositions which have been rendered familiar by a 
previous exercise of reasoning or are intuitively cer 
tain in every simple process of reasoning two mem 
bers or parts are employed and these members or 
parts must of themselves be obvious to the under 
standing and we assent to their truth immediately 
upon their enunciation in a syllogism the premises 
are assumed to be selfevident truths and if this 
were not the case we could never draw any logical in 



on syllogisms 

ference from tbem in the majcnr of a sjhogism the 
connexion between the snbjeet and the predicate could 
not be observed by the mind by a mere attention to 
die ideas themselves which compose the major for 
this proposition requires as much proof as the con 
clusion drawn from it in this case the mind must 
find out fresh matter to trace the connexion wanted 
and fumish another syllogism to establish the first 
point in the general one and should it so happen 
that this second syllogism is not found sufficient to 
establish the truth of the first we must have recourse 
to a third and a fourth and so on till it be disco 
vered we go on in this manner till we arrive at 
perfect intuitive truths and here we are compelled to 
rest satisfied 

from these rarks it is maintained therefore 
that every single process of reasoning is founded upon 
intuitive propositions and if this be not the case 
syllcsms must be employed to lay the foundation 
by this view of the matter every train of reasoning 
consists of a greater or lesser number of syllogisms 
these may not in many cases be put into a ibrmal 
shape but it is entiiely from the natural connexion 



 ov syllooifims 

which subsists among the propositions that the force 
and cogency of general reasoning proceeds 

to show the nature of the syllogism more clearly 
we shall here give an example let us take the pro 
position and form it into the shape of a syllogism — 
that man otight to practise justice now we want 
to discover the relation which ought to subsist be 
tween man and justice for the mind does not per 
ceive this relation as the proposition at present 
stands by considering the matter a little we soon 
learn that for man to be under an obligation to do a 
thing he must have the sagacity to perceive and the 
power to execute it a creature must have the fa 
culty of distinguishing good from evil as well as the 
liberty of choosing either otherwise he lies under no 
obligation to perform the one or refrain from the other 
now these are the middle terms or ideas which 
must be compared by the mind with the first term in 
the proposition namely man and when we have 
made this comparison we find that it may be affirmed 
of him that he is a being who can distinguish good 
from evil and that he has the liberty of choice in his 
actions we have here then two distinct judg 



on syllooims 

ments that man can distinguish good from evil and 
that he has the power of himself to do either and 
a third judgment immediately suggests itself that 
man ought to practise justice the argument may 
now be put into the shape of a syllogism thus 

every creature possessed of reason and liberty ought 

to practise justice 
man is a creature possessed of reason and liberty 
therefore man ought to practise justice 

in this syllogism three distinct parts or proposi 
tions are involved and they are so arranged as to 
agree with the mode which our minds naturally fol 
low in the arrangement of our ideas in reasoning 
the first two propositions are denominated the pre 
mises because they go before or lay the foundation 
for the other proposition which is called the conclu 
sion in consequence of its naturally growing out of 
the premises but there is a matter here which the 
reader will do well to consider thoroughly and make 
himself master of the two terms man and justice 

which express the two ideas whose conneidon or rela 
 



 on syiiloaisms 

tion we wish to fidd out are called the extremes and 
the intermediate idea by which this connexion or 
relation is discovered namely a being possessed of 
reason and liberty y takes the name of the middle term 
now we axe to understand that before the premises of 
a syllogism can be established the terms called the 
extremes and the middle term must be compared 
together for out of this comparison proceeds the very 
essence of the syllogism the conclusion is the pro 
position which arises from the extremes being con 
sidered either in connexion with or separated from 
that which appears the result of this compariscm 

reasoning in common life has been affirmed to be 
nothing more than merely ascribing the general 
qualities of things to their objects in matters with 
which we are concerned we refer a particular ob 
ject to some general head or class which general 
head or class possesses some fixed attribute or quality 
we then ascribe that attribute or quality to the par 
ticular object we have placed under the general as 
sortment of things thus if i scrutinize the charac 
ter of my friend john and find it to be virtuous i 
then begin to reflect that a virtuous character is 



on stilgim 

worthy of esteem and reward and i draw the con 
clusion that the conduct of john is worthy of esteein 
and reward this is the common process which the 
mind follows in fchrming judgments of this descrip 
tion if we wish to arrange the process of reasoning 
in the form of a syllogism it will stand thus — 

every virtuous man is worthy of esteem and reward 

john is a virtuous man 

therefore john is worthy of esteem and reward 

these few remarks apply to syllogisms in general 
but we come now to speak of the different kinds or 
sorts of syllogisms there are four general assort 
ments which take their rise from the particular situ 
ation which the middle term holds in the syllogism 
st that in which the middle term is the subject of 
the major proposition and the predicate of the minor 
d that in which the middle term becomes the pre 
dicate of both premises d that in which the 
nuddle term becomes the subject of both premises 
and th that in which the middle term is the pre 
dicate of the major proposition and the subject of 



 on syllogisms 

the minor these four different classes or assort 
ments become divided again according to what lo 
gicians call their modes which are determined by the 
quantity and quality of the proposition framed into 
syllogisms by quantity is meant the consideration 
of propositions as they relate to universah or particu 
lars and by quality whether these propositions be 
of an affirmative or negative description all the 
possible modes of syllogisms may be found by ascer 
taining how many combinations may be made out of 
these four general kinds the number will be sixty 
four which multiplied by four will give two hundred 
and fiftysix 

each of these figures has rules peculiar to itself 
but there are some rules which are common to all 
syllogisms and aristotle enumerates the following 
st every syllogism must have only three terms or 
propositions d the middle term must be taken i 
universally in one of the premises d if one of thei 
extremes be particular in one of the premises it must 
also be particular in the conclusion th the con 
elusion must be particular if either of the premised 
be particular and negative if either of the premises 

i 



 on sylloeih s 

be negative th no term can be taken untveraalty 
in the conclusion if it be not taken universally in 
the premises 

without drawing out these general remarks on the 
nature of syllogisms to a greater length we shall now 
advert to a few only of the different kinds of syllo 
gisms these will be sufficient for common purposes 
as well as to illustrate the leading principles of the 
syllcistic theory 

there is a kind of syllogism in which the number 
of propositions is more than three this syllogism 
is technically called a sorites which means a number 
of propositions piled up one upon another in which 
the predicate of the first proposition is made the sub 
ject of the second and so on till in the conclusion 
the predicate is attributed to the first subject thus 

man is an animal 
every animal is a body 
every body is a substance 
therefore every man is a substance 



now this particular combination of propositions 

h 



 on tlim 

it must appear obvioiis to the reader may be con 
tinued to almost any length we sire without weak 
ening the premises or grounds on which the conclu 
sion tests the reason of this is that this kind of 
compound syllogisms may be divided into as many 
simple ones as there are middle terms in the sorites 
when such a division takes place and the simple 
syllogisms fellow one another the last in the series 
becomes the conclusion of the compound syllogism or 
sorites this method therefore of constructing syl 
logisms is nothing more nor less than joining together 
seval sample syllogisms and consequently the sori 
tes must stand upon the same ground in respect to 
logical stability as do the indivuual parts of which 
it is composed 

therfe is another kind of syllogisms called by lo 
gicians entkymeme where one of the parts is omitted 
and is left for the mind to supply upon the spur of 
the moment this happens when one or more of 
the premises is a selfevident truth and familiar to 
the mind of every one such for instance is the 
following i 



on sylloisis 

every man must breathe 
therefore the king must breathe 

this syllogism has the appearance of being imper 
fect as having only two priositions but this is not 
the case it is really complete for the minor pro 
position txtry king is a man is omitted and the 
reader is supposed to supply the ellipsis in his own 
mind 

false syllogisms are called paralogisms and a 
lse syllogism the error or fijlacy of which is not 
very readily perceived by the mind is called a so 
phism the following kinds of sophisms are gener 
ally treated of by writers on logic 

ignoratio eknchij or a mistake of the question is 
a term applied to a proposition which has no neces 
sary connexion with the subject in dispute if for 
example a man should wish to establish the posi 
tion that god is infinitely good and merciful and 
begin by demonstrating his unniscience this would 
be a deviation from the question under consideration 
for gods omniscience may be granted and yet his 



b on syhhoaism 

goodness and mercy may still remain subjects of dis 
cussion in like manner a man may argue that all 
religion is a delusion for he has seen some persons 
who have made loud professions of piety and devotion 
in public who were nevertheless very profligate and 
wicked in their general conduct this also is an tg 
noratio elenchi or a mistake of the question for a 
hypocritical professor of a stem is here made the 
test or standard by which the nature and truth of 
that system is to be estimated 

petitto principti or begging the question is a 
term employed to denote the taking for granted the 
proposition you wish to prove if a man wre to 
maintain that a certain act of his was not in the least 
immoral because it was not contrary to the acknow 
ledged rules of morality nor to commands of scrip 
ture he would here be begging die question and 
assuming in the outset the very thing he was desirous 
to prove — the harmless nature of the act this mode 
of reasoning is also sometimes called arguing idem 
per idem 

arguing in a circk is when the premises are de 



on ¥liismfil 

monstrated by the oenclusion and the coficlusion by 
the premises if for instance itbe affirmed that 
the authority of any particular church proves the 
truth of the sacred scriptures and the scriptures the 
authority of that church this would be arguing in 
a circle 

non causa pro causa the assigning of a false 
cause for any effect thus when a person ascribes 
certain events to good or ill luck to the influence of 
the planets or the like 

fallacia accidnttsf arguing from what is local and 
incidental to what is general and essential if for 
example a person were to maintain that a banknote 
of any country is of a value as universal and absolute 
as a piece of gold this would be a fallacia acctdentis 
for paper money has only a local but gold a general 
value and further if a man were to say that any 
particular amusement is dangerous or immoral be 
cause it is liable to be abused this is arguing from 
what is particular and accidental to what is general 
and essential 

sophisms of equivocation are those which are 
formed by the employment of ambiguous terms or 



 on syllogisms 

terms which are of doubtful meaning the following 
is an old example 

he that says you are an animal says true 

he that says you are a goose says you are an animal 

therefore he that says you are a goose says true 

we have here given as full an account of the dif 
ferent kinds of syllogisms as will prove of considera 
ble assistance to the reader in gaining an insight into 
their general nature and application the catalogue 
might haye been greatly extended but this might 
have rendered the work uninteresting without any 
corresponding benefit 

the utility of the syllogistic theory has been long 
and keenly contested even at the present day a 
considerable diversity of opinion prevails as to its na 
ture and the extent of its usefulness but the dis 
pute though still undecided is now carried on with 
more calmness and judgment than in bygone times 
and perhaps the day is not far distant when an 

 bentham comp logc 



o tilook 

unanimous and settled optniwi will be entertained by 
all speculative thiiikrs as to the true nate of the 
lineal writings tf aristotle and the portion of aise 
to which they are justly ititl 

it would be contrary to the plan of this work to 
enter into any lengthened account the controversy 
on this subject but brfore quitting this chapter i 
will take the liberty of making a few remarks on the 
general importance of the syllogism as an instru 
ment of reasoning 

it was long contended by the friends of the syllo 
gistic method that it was a valuable instrument for 
the discovery of truth this was stoutly denied by 
its adversaries the disputants are now however 
almost completely agreed that it is of no use for the 
discovery of unknown truths but its friends still 
maintain that it is very useful as an illustration of the 
uniform nature of all kinds of reasoning and as a 
test to try the soundnjess osfh kinds of arguments 
 in an able work recently published by arehbibhop 
wbately on the use of lie syllogistic theory the 
author observes that logic which is as it were 
the grammar of reasoning does not bring forward the 



 onlriiiiimft 

regular syuogism as a dincit mode of argumentation 
designed to be substituted for any other mode but 
as the form to which all correct reasoning may be ul 
timately reduced and which consequently serves 
the purpose when we are employing logic as an ariyj 
of a test to try the validity oi any argument in the 
same manner as by chemical analysis we develope and 
submit to a distinct examination the elements of 
which any compound body is composed and are thus 
enabled to detect any latent sophistication and impu 
rity 

now i must confess that i cannot see the truth 
of these remarks allowing with the author that 
the syllogism is the form into which all reasoning is 
resolvable yet he distinctly observes— and the obser 
vation is forced upon every one who will for a mo 
ment think of the nature of the syllogism— that in 
all cases we must take the premises for granted be 
fore we can obtain the conclusion derivable from a 
syllogism the difficulty in this case is to see how 
an instrument of this kind can be useful as a test to 

 elements of logic p 



on syllogisms 

try the validity or soundness of any argument where 
the fundamental premises on whidi the argument is 
grounded must be taken for granted and when the 
conclusion which must arise from thislqgical test is 
obtained without any reference whatever to either the 
truth or falsehood of these same premises 

let us for the sake of clearness try the principle laid 
down by the archbishop by adducing two syllogisms 

all tyrannical governments are bad 
the turkish government is a tyrannical go 
vernment 
therefore the turkish government is bad 

again 

au animals walk on four legs 
 man is an animal 
therefore man walks en four legs 

these are perfect syllogisms and the reasoning 
 the same in both considered as mere reasoning 
if we take the premises in both syllogisms for grant 



 on stlloims 

ed as we are bound to do before we can be entitled 
to ftaw the conclusions then these conclusions must 
be both true that the turkish government is a bed 
government and that man walks upon four legs 
now is this the way to try the validity of any argu 
ment or to detect any latent sophistication or im 
purity in a piece of lengthened and general reasoa 
ing 

it appears to me that the archbishop has fiiuen 
into error regarding the nature and importance of the 
syllogism from instituting certain analogies between 
it and some other departments of knowledge such 
as chemistry grammar and arithmetic he com 
pares the analysis of a piece of reasoning to the che 
mical analysis of any material substance he ima 
gines that the logic of syllogisms bears the same 
relation to general reasoning that gnunmardoes to 
language and the technical terms in which the 
syllogistic process is couched are viewed as resem 
bling the arbitrary signs affixed to arithmetical quan 
tities a very slight attention however to those 
analogical illustrations will be sufficient to convince 
the reader that they are by no means perfect iiet us 



ok yllm 

take cheimstrr for an example a chemist may 
analyze any given substance into what be considers 
its elementary parts but it by no means follows 
tliat these parts individually can be employed to re 
present with inialliue certainty the properties and 
uses of these same elementary parts when united in 
to one substance every material body is composed 
of elementary parts and these parta are indispensa 
bly neeessary to make that body what it is no one 
dementary part can be dispensed with in the combi 
nation otherwise the sensible properties of the gene 
ral body would be so altered or modified as entirely 
to destroy its identity now in reasoning this is not 
the se according to the views held by archbishop 
whately all reasoning he maintains is composed 
of the same materials namely syllogisms reasour 
ing is not in this case at least like a substance sub 
jected to chemical analysis divided into its elemen 
tary parts because there are no parts for if it be 
reasoning it must be the syllogism and nothing 
more chemical agency consists merely in separating 
one thing from another setting either apart or 
combining them with other things with which they 



 ok stlxogim 

have a greater or less affinity but to institute an 
analogy between this prooess and the analysis of a 
piece of reasoning we might ask what other elements 
compose this piece besides the syllogism the an 
swer according to archbishop whatelys theory must 
be that there are no other parts at all reasoning 
is a simple homogeneous matter and therefore it can 
only be a test of itself the syllogism must be the 
argument and the argument must be the syllogism 
and therefore the syllogism must be the true stand 
ard by which we must try the validity of the syllogism 
i readily admit that it is by no means a fitir or 
useful mode of reasoning to lay too much stress upon 
slight discrepancies in analogical arguments where 
they are brought forward as mere auxiliaries to make 
us understand and perceive the feioe of a complex ar 
gument but in the instance before us the case is 
different archbishop whately letaa a whole sys 
tem upon these imperfect analogies and it becomes 
us therefore to examine most minutely the grounds 
on which his positions rest he makes very fiee 
with chemical illustrations throughout his work and 
the following is a very pointed one the diemist 



on stllqoims 

to pursue the illustratiqii ke by iiim his tests 
and his method of analysis to be employed when any 
substance is offered to his notioe the oompositioii of 
which has not been ascertained or in which adultera 
tion is suspected now a fallacy may apdy be com 
pared to some adulterated compound it conists of 
an uigenious mixture of truth and fidsehood so en 
tangled so intimately blended that the fidsehood is 
in the chemical phrase held in solution one drop 
of sound logic is that test which immediately disunites 
them makes the foreign substance visible and preci 
pitates it to the bottom 

the conclusion of a syllogism is said to depend 
upon the premises these premises must be taken 
for granted and whether they are trae or fidse does 
not impair the force or alter the nature of the con 
clusion considered merely as a conclusion yet this 
form of argumentation acknowledged by its advocates 
as existing independently of either truth or falsehood 
is the grand chemical solvent for detecting every 
kind and degree of error this certainly must ap

pear in the eyes of onsimon sense to be rather a pa 
radoxical and startling position 

these remarks which might have been greatly ex 
tended have not been made with the most distant 
idea of passing any censure upon the logical work of 
archbishop whately but solely from a wish to cau 
tion the reader against too ardent an admiration of 
the syllogistic mode of reasoning as if it were fitted 
to render him a comprehensive and candid reasoner 
the whole history c literature fiimishes incontestable 
evidence of the insufficiency of the aristotelian logic 
to produce of itself either acuteness of mind or lo 
gical dexterity the strictures of bacon locke 
reid campbell and stewart have not bn counte 
racted by any subsequent statements which the advo 
cates of the system of logic have hitherto advanced 
and judging from the nature of the system itself 
there is not the most distant prospect of the doctrine

on technical phbas in the abt cv logic 

there are several technical phrases used both in ge 
neial writing and conversation with which it is ne 
cessary that every young student especially should be 
familiar there are also certain terms in common 
use descriptive of certain kinds or classes of argu 
ments treated of by logicians these technical phrases 
or terms are not now used so firequently as formerly 
but still they do very frequently occur pardcularly in 
those writings where profound and abstract questions 
are discussed it becomes necessary therefore tliat 
the reader should be made acquainted with their na 
ture and use we shall here give an explanation of 
some of them without however assuming any pre 
tensims to give more than a w specimens

a priori — this term means that we reason from 
the cause to the effect thus we say that the deity 
must be infinite in his power in his wisdom and in 
his benevolence therefore the universe which is the 
work of his hands must be of infinite extent of ad 
mirable contrivance and productive of general felicity 

a posteriori means that we argue from the effects 
to the cause for instance the fiibric of nature 
gives in every department which is accessible to our 
inquiries and observation evident proo of contriv 
ance and benevolence of design therefore we are 
entitled to infer that there is an allpowerful intelli 
gent and benevolent cause of all things 

reductio ad absurdum is a term for a certain kind 
of argument which proves the truth of any condu

chapter iii 

sriscellanbovs hints for the government and 
luprovement of the understanping 

reading — a proper and judicious system of read 
ing is of the highest importance two things are 
necessary in perusing the mental labours of others 
namely not to read too much and to pay great at 
tention to the nature of what you do read many 
people peruse books for the express and avowed pur 
pose of consuming time and this class of readers 
forms by far the majority of what are termed the 
reading public others again read with the laudable 
anxiety of being made wiser and when this object is 
not attained the disappointment may generally be 
attributed either to the habit of reading too much 



govebnment and improvement sscc 

or of paying insufscient attention to what ils under 
their notice 

every man of experience and observation in the 
world must have met with many instances where 
individuals of a literary taste peruse volume after 
volume with a keenness and avidity which might 
indicate that they would be largely benefited thereby 
yet the fact is that such people seldom grow any 
wiser the knowledge they thus voraciously devouif 
is never regularly concocted or digested in their 
minds nothing therefore is of greater importancp 
towards a mans advancement in real knowledge than 
to avoid falling into an error of this kind when a 
book is put into your hands you should read it with 
care and attention and always to the end should it 
be but a book embracing the illustration of abstract 
principles you ought never to read too much of it at 
once try to seize the leading views of the author 
and make them objects of your own contemplation 
canvass them thoroughly in your own mind and 
when you have made them familiar to your under 
standing you will then find you have made some 
progress in knowledge and not contented yourself 



 oovsbnment and ihpbovement 

with merely ootming over a few written characters to 
which you have attached no distinct meaning you 
will soon experience the advantages of limited read 
ing you will soon find when an opportjunity occurs 
to measure your strength with others that you will 
be better prepared for the intellectual conflict and 
ynjl acquit yoursdf with more credit than those who 
devour every book which falls in their way without 
the exercise of any discrimination or without any 
vigorousr effort of judgment to understand the subject 
of which the author treats the words of hobbes 
e worthy of remembrance on this sulect if 
says he j bad read as much as ny neighbours i 
would have been as ignorant 

writing — the habit of committing our thoughts 
to writing is a powerful means of expanding the 
mind and producing a logical and systematic arrange 
ment of our views and opinions it is this which 
gives the writer a yast superiority as to the accuracy 
and extent of his ponceptions over the mere talker 
jvo one can ever hope to know the principles of any 
art or science thoroughly who does not write as well 
 jread upon the subjept 



of the tmbebstanbnio 

oiie of the gieatt and most prevaletit stumbling 
blocks to newbeginners in composition is the almost 
universal desire they show to write something istry 
fine they take up their pens and expect that 
thoughts of singular sublimity will be showered down 
upon their noiinds for their own exclusive honour and 
distinction they look upon their pen as a magi 
cians wand with which they can conjure up at will 
truths the most interesting and vitally important 
these extravagant and mistaken notions lead timid 
minds to despair and those of a firmer and more 
resolute character to midnight obscurity 

in writing therefore the general rule we should 
always keep before the minds eye is that our written 
words be a simple transcript of our thoughts the 
language ought to be as plain as possible and in 
tnost cases dmply that in which our ideas were first 
suggested to our minds this rule will be found of 
infinite value on those subjects of inquiry where in 
tricate processes of reasoning are required for want 
of observing it many minds of great original strength 
and acuteness have run a most unprofitable course 
and been constantly overshooting the mark by an 



 oovbbnhsnt and impbovbhent 

anxious desdre to clothe their ideas in what they con 
sider sublime and elevated language 

general principles — another fruitful means of 
strengthening the judgmcsit and making progress in 
knowledge is to systematize your information learn 
to make yourself master of the principles of a science 
this is of great moment even considered in the light 
of a saving of time for when the principles are un 
derstood the foundation is laid and the rearing of 
the superstructure becomes comparativdy easy and 
pleasant a man who knows the principles of any 
department of knowledge has greatly the advantage 
over one who may have ten times the number of facts 
belonging to the science in question but who is des 
titute of a thorough knowledge of the leading truths 
into which they are resolvable in several branches 
of information it is not by any means a bad plan to 
become as early as possible acquainted with the theory 
after a limited number of facts has been well under 
stood and rivetted in the mind this is a very good 
method for those to follow who do not wish to be 
adepts in any science but only to have a general ao 
quaintance with its nature and principles 



of ths ttnbisrranfdina 

it is remarked hj mr hume duit die differ 
ence between a common man and a man of genius is 
chiefly seoi in de shauowness or depth of the pin 
cifdes upon wfaidi they proceed neyer were more 
judidoas words than diese uttered in referenoe to the 
mind of man we every day behold the prodigious 
power which die habit of seizing general principles 
gives to the individuals who possess it and the mark 
ed and pointed inteqectual inferiority of those who 
have it not ilie degree in which this power is 
found in the individual becomes the standard by 
which we measure his mental qualifications in ct 
it may foe considered as the intellectual barometer by 
which to estimate the inward capabilities of all men 

independence of mini — learn to make whatever 
falls under your notice in die works of others your 
own by contracting a habit of canvassing principles 
and views widi strictness and judgment and by 
looking at the discoveries of others with your own 
eyes do not adopt sentiments by implicit diota 
tion this independence of mmd is of essential im 
portance to the fuu and vigorous exerdse of your own 
powers and will dirow such an air of respectability 



 govbenmknt and imfrotbment 

over your mental qualifications that a comparatively 
small portion of information will attract more notice 
and be more highly appreciated than a much greater 
portion would be were you servile or slavish in adopt 
ing without due personal examination the opinions 
and systems of others 

but there is one error to which this independence 
this desire of originality is apt to lead and that 
is to a cavilling and disputatious trifling this is 
truly a serious defect in a mans mental character 
and when it becomes deeply rooted it is not only 
very difficult to be eradicated but in nine cases out 
of ten it totally destroys a mans mind as far as use 
fulness goes and renders nugatory the most impos 
ing mental acquirements when a man sets out in 
every examination or dispute with a fixed and un 
swerving determination to say or think nothing but 
what is new he will most assuredly in the gene 
rality of cases fail in his object and will exhibit him 
self to his hearers or readers in the light of a dull 
proser or a trifling quibbler we firequently meet 
with persons of very extensive learning who when a 

general principle is propounded to them instead of 
 



of ths uninsrstanbing 

embracing it as a whole and acknowledging its great 
importance immediately exert their ingenuity to set 
it aside by descanting upon the importance of isolated 
facts or trifling exceptions there is nothing of a 
rational or substantial nature to be expected com 
such minds they wander through the fields of 
knowledge like children taken abroad to look at the 
face of nature but who content themselves with pay 
ing exclusive attention to the small weeds and flowers 
whidi promiscuously fall in their way instead of 
viewing the more stupendous operations of nature so 
profusely exhibited in all her works 

a love of truth — this is a most important ha 
bit to cultivate and it claims an alliance with the 
heart as well as the head it must be grounded on a 
virtuous disposition for no vicious person can be a 
lover of truth we ought always to remember that 
our reasoning faculties were not given us to exercise 
them as mere whim or fancy might dictate but to 
be the active instruments of guiding us to truth and 
promoting our happiness as rational and immortal 
creatures to enter into verbal or written disputa

critical notices of the work 

 mr blakeys volames are a valuable addition to the prac 
tieal science of mind we recommend them to the lovers 
of moral cienceieimbian 

 in perspicuity of style in accuracy of deduction in the 
neatness and compression with which the substance of the 
several works examined by mr blakey has been written few 
books on the subject can be compared with the present — 
tte mercury 

 a more instructive or interesting work can hardly be 
imagined and we eamesdy recommend the student of moral 
philosophy who feels the necessary brevity of a course of 
lectures too contracted to admit him to an acquaintance with 
the many glides to moral truth whose names he may hear 
and to whose opinions he may be referred to provide himself 
with a copy of the book under notice — atlos 



 this work has every recommendation to popularity 
and as far as we have been able to examine it we must say 
that the author appears to have executed his difficult an 
laborious task witn great talent and impartialityiveu 
€xistie chronicle 

 the work will be useful to those who wish to know 
what the different moral and metaphysical writers with 
wbose names only they are at present acquainted have said 
without the trouble of reading their voluminous works — 
sun d 

 to meet a desideratum which not only toe jjeneral and 
intelligent but the learned and philosopnicl feader must 
feel mr blakey has here produced a work orgfat utility 
literary gazette 

 without affecting a critical knowledge of this abstract 
subject we may safe commend these impartial and candid 
sumnoaries to the favourable attention of such of our readers 
as may desire a useful map or guidebook to facilitate their 
progress to the regions of ethicu science — leeds mercury 

 on the whole we can safly recommend these volumes 
as treating of a subject which has occupied the attention 
of mankind in all ages and which to the young student 
without some such guide to point out as it were the leading 
features of the science at one view is beset with difficulties 
tending to involve the mind in the mazes of scepticism if not 
infidelity — newcastle courant 

 the work is executed with considerable ability and will 
be read by all who desire to obtain an acquaintance with 
the elements of moral science and with the sources whence 
a more extended knowledge of the subject may be derived 
with great advantageivet monthly magazine 

 in these two volumes we have found much very much 
that will repay the reader for the time necessary to a careful 
and studious examination of them mr blakey has by the 
publication of these his labours rendered no trivial service 
to the explorers of moral science and seekers after truth 
he is no fanciful or falucious guide he leads the ethical 
student no wilothe wispdance through a morass of mor 
bid speculation the light that breaks through his pages i 
a clear and finely burning flame — the true sun 



 we bave not tbe pleasure of an acquaintance with the 
inteliigfent aathor of these tivo elegant volumes but from 
a slight examination of his labours we must pronounce him 
to be a diligent student a correct thinker and a person of 
the best moral feeling his work will be most valuable to 
students at college and also to those who wish by a small 
portion of reading to form some accurate idea of the various 
systems of mental science which have obtained from the 
peripatetic school downwards — evangelical magazine 

 as a synopsis of what has been written on ethics in this 
country it is certainly a useful book and will afford a means 
of acquiring that knowledge with little labour which to 
have sought in the many volumes written on this subject 
would be found scarcely to repay the trouble— co wew 
magazine and monthly review 

 mr blakeys statement of the opinions of these various 
authors deserves the praise of honesty he never perversely

 we take our leave of the work with many thanks to 
the author for the treat he has afforded us his work would 
have been to us invaluable when passing through our course 
of moral philosophy and we woula strongly recommend it to 
every student it brings together a mass of important in 
formation not easily to be met with elsewhere and will help 
the student to form a correct and intelligent opinion wita 
regard to the various moral systems which may be brought 
under his notice we should think the work well adapted 
also for popular libraries for the discussions are conducted in 
as popular a form as they can possibly be made to assume 
the work deserves to take and we doubt not will soon 
take its place amidst the permanent and standard literature 
of the kingdom — edinburgh christian instructor 

 without any reference to the views of mr blakey hinn 
self as to the formation of a system of moral ethics there 
can be no hesitation in fixing a high standard of value to his 
work as an historical comment on the most important themes 
of ethical science from the earliest periods to the preseul 
timesj ckiistian remembrancer 



 we have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the 
general fidelity and candour which characterise our authors 
statements to the comprehensive yet condensed view he 
has given of the various systems noticed and commented on 
and to the truly philosophic spirit in which all his inquiries 
are conducted showing a mina at once uncommonlv capable 
of such investigations and intimately familiar witn the re 
gions of contemplation to which they lead we can with 
out iiesitation therefore recommend a careful perusal of the 
work — presbyterian review 

 a correct and condensed view of the principal theories 
in moral science has long been felt to be t desideratum by 
those who have been engaged in prosecuting such in 
quiries and we readily acknowledge therefore that a debt 
of gratitude is due to mr blakey for the able and interest 
ing work now before us it is well conceived and ad 
mirabljt executed displayins an intimate acquaintance with 
the various opinions which he records and what we reckon 
a peculiar merit of the work the author instead of con 
tenting himself as most historians of philosophy have done 
before him with a dry detail of the sentiments of others 
enters into a careful and in some instances lengthened dis 
cussion of the most interesting questions connected with the

the connexion between our notions of moral 

good and evil and oub conceptions of the 

freedom of the divine and human wills 

by robert blakey 

edinbnrgh adam black and longman and co london 

 mr blakeys book on moral good and evil is an admi 
rable one — world 

 this is an elaborate work on a subject of the highest 
moment the writer is evidently a man of considerable 
thought and discrimination the subject discussed is pecu 
liarly important it is one which has been clouded and mysti 
fied by many writers and it is interesting to have a ladd 
and superior vurae professiedly discussing the subject in a 
manly honest and energetic manner we recommend this 
work as one of much thought and as possessing a solid and 
valuable character — pulpit 

 between the human species and the brute creation there 
is this grand mark of distinction that while the latter are 
blindly led by a compulsory instinct the former is conscious 
of an intellectual responsibility and this responsibility is so 
closely connected with the notion of moral freedom that 
we neither act nor speak nor think without a tacit con 
ception of the praise or censure which our thoughts words 
or actions are calculated to elicit this connexion is admir 
ably traced by mr blakey — christian memembrancer 

 mr blakey has taken up an oftenagitated metaphysi 
cal question which he has treated in an easy and popular 
manner conveying many important suggestions and much 
sound argument in terms that may with perfect ease be an 
deratood by all who understand the language in which he 
writes — jedinburgh christian instructor
