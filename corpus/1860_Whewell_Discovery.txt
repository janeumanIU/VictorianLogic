preface 


jpiie two works which i entitled the history of 
tlie inductive sciences and the philosophy of the 
inductive were intended to present to the 

reader a view of the steps by which those portions 
of human knowledge which are held to be most 
certain and stable have been acquired and of the 
philosophical princiles which are involved in those 
steps each of these steps was a scientific biscocery 
in which a new conception vrus apjlied in order to 
bind together observed facts and though the con 
junction of the observed facts was in each case an 
example of logical induction it vras not the induc 
tivo process merely but the novelty of the result in 
each case which gave its peculiar character to the 
history and the philosophy at which i aimed was 
not the philosophy of induction but the philosophy 
oj discovery in the present edition have de 
scribed this as my object in my title

preface 


a great part of the present volume consists of 
chapters which coiiijosed the twelfth book of the 
philosophy in former editions which book was then 
described as a ‘ boview of opinions on the imture of 
knowledge and the method of seeking it’ i have 
added to this part scvenil new chapters on plato 
aristotle the arabian philosophers francis bacon 
mr mill mr manscl the late sir william llamil 
ton and the gerniaii philosophers kant fichte 
schelling and hegel i might if time had allowed 
hiive added a new chapter on lioger bacon founded 
on his opus minus and other works recently published 
for the first time under the direction of master of 
the rolls a valuable contribution to the history of 
ihilosophy but the review of this work would not 
materially alter the estimate of roger bacon which i 
had derived from the opus majus 

but besides these historical and critical surveys of 
the philosojhy of otheis i have ventured to intro 
duce some new views of my own namely views 
which iwar upon the philosohy of religion i have 
done so under the conviction that no philosophy of 
the universe can satisfy the minds of thoughtful men 
which does not deal with such questions as inevi 
tably force themselves on our notice respecting the 
author and the object of the universe and also 
under the conviction that every ydiilosophy of the 



preface 


vll 


universe which has any consistency must sug 
gest answers at least conjectural to such ques 
tions no costiwb is complete from which the ques 
tion of deity is excluded and all cosmology has 
a side turned towards theology though i am aware 
therefore how easy it is on this subject to give 
offence and to incur oblocpiy i have not thought it 
right to abstain from following out my philosophical 
princijilcs to their results in this department of specu 
lation the results do not differ materially from 
those at which many jjious and thoughtful speculators 
have arrived in previous ages of the world though 
they have here as seems to me something of novelty 
in their connection with the philosophy of science 
but this point i willingly leave to the calm de 
cision of competent judges 

 have added in an appendix various essays 
previously publisheti at different times which may 
serve perhaps to illustrate some points of the history 
and philosophy of science

introduction 


b y the examination of the elements of human 
thought in wliich i ha been gngaged and by 
a consideration of the history of the most clear and 
certain parts of our knowledge i have been led to 
doctrines respecting the progress of that exact and 
systematic knowledge which we call science and 
those doctrines have endeavoured to lay before the 
reader in the history of the sciences and of scientific 
ideas the cpiestious on which i have thus ventured 
to pronounce have had a strong interest for man from 
the earliest period of his intellectual progress and 
liave been the subjects of lively discussion and bold 
speculation in evciy age i conceive that in the doc 
trines to which those researches have conducted us 
we have a for better hope that we possess a body of 
permanent truths than the earlier essays on the same 
subjects could furnish for we have not taken our 
examples of knowledge at hazard as earlier secula 
tors did and were almost compelled to do but have 
drawn our materials from the vast store of unques 
tioned truths which modern science offers to us and 
we have formed our judgment concerning the nature 
and progress of knowledge by considering what such 
science is and how it has reached its present condition 
but though we have thus pursued our speculations 
cuncerning knowledge with advantages which earlier 
writers did not possess it is still both interesting and 
instructive for us to regard the opinions upon this 
subject which have been delivered by the philosophers 
of past times it is especially interesting to seesome 
of the truths which we have endeavoured to expound 
gradimlly dawning in mens minds and assuming the 



 


philosophy op discovery 


clear and permanent form in which we can now con 
template them i shall thoretbre in the ensuing 
chapters pass in review many of the opinions of the 
writers of various ages concerning the mode by which 
man best acquires the truest knowledge and i shall 
endeavour as we proceed to ajpreciato the real value 
of such judgments and their place in the progress of 
sound philosophy 

in this estimate of the inions of others i shall 
be guided by those general doctrines whicli i have as 
i trust establibved in the histories alieady published 
and without attempting here to give any summary 
of these doctrines i may remark that there are two 
main principles by which speculations on such sub 
jects in all ages arc connected and related to each 
other namely the opmsition of idem and senaatiiyus 
and the distinction of practical and speculative know 
ledge the opposition of ideas and sensations is ex 
hibited to us in the antithesis of theory and fact 
which are necessarily considered as distinct and of 
opposite natures and yet necessarily identical and 
constituting science by their identity in like msui 
ner altlxough practic knowledge is in substance 
identical with specuutive for all knowledge is specu 
lation there is a distinction between the two in their 
history and in the subjects by which they are exem 
plified which distinction is quite essential in judging 
of the philosophical views of the ancients the 
alternatives of identity and diversity in those two 
antitheses — the succossive separation opposition and 
reunion of principles which thus arise — have pro 
duced as they may easily be imagined capable of 
doing a long and varied series of systems concerning 
the nalure of knowledge among which wo shall have 
to guide our course by the aid of the views already 
presented 

i am far from undertaking or wishing to review 
the yholo series of opinioxis which thus come under 
our notice and i do not even atteinjt to examine all 
the principal authors who have written on such sub 
jects merely wish to select some of the most con 



introduction 


 


siderable forms which such opinions have assumed 
and to point out in some measure the progress of truth 
from ago to age in doing this i can only endeavour 
to seize some of the most prominent features of each 
time and of each hep and i must pass rapidly from 
classical antiquity to those which we have called the 
dark ages and from them to modem times at each 
of these periods the modifications of opinion and the 
speculations with which they were connected formed 
a vast and tangled maze the byways of which our 
plan does not allow us to tcr sha esteem 

ourselves but too fortunate if we can discover the 
single track by which ancient led to modem philo 
sophy 

i must also repeat that my suf vey of philosojphical 
writera is here confined to this one poin — their opi 
nions on the nature of knowledge and the method of 
science i with some effort avoid entering upon other 
parts of the philosophy of those authors of whom i 
speak j knowingly pass by those portions of their 
speculations which are in many cases the most inter 
esting and celebiuted — their opinions concerning the 
human soil the divine governor of the world the 
foundations or leiuling doctrines of politics religion 
and general philosophy i am desirous that my 
reader should bear this in mind since he must other 
wise ik offended with the scanty and partis view 
which i give in this jfiace of the philosophers whom 
 enumemte 



chapter il 
plato 


t here would be small advantage in beginning our 
examination earlier than the period of the socratic 
school a atheijis for dithough the spirit of inquiry 
on such subjects had awakened in gieece at an eorliei 
period and although the p‘culiar aptitude of the 
grecian mind fur such researches had shown itself 
reeatedly in subtle distinctions and acute reasonings 
all the positive results of these early efforts were con 
tained in a more definite form in the reasonings of the 
platonic age before that time the greeks did not 
possess plain and familiar examples of exact know 
ledge such as the truths of arithmetic gacoraetry 
astronomy and optics became in tbo school of plato 
nor were the antitheses of which we spoke above so 
distinctly and fully unfolded as wo find them in plato’s 
works 

the question which hinges upon one of those anti 
theses occupies a prominent place in several of the 
platonic dialogues j namely whether our knowledge 
be obtained by means of sensation or of ideas one 
of the doctrines which plato most earnestly inculcated 
upon his countrymen was that we do not know con 
cerning sensible objects but concerning ideas the 
first attempts of the greeks at metaphysical analysis 
had given rise to a school which maintained at 
rnate objects are the only rcalitiea in opposition 
to this arose another school which taught that ma 
terial objects have no permanent reality but are ever 
waxing and waning constantly changing their sub 
stance and hence” as aristotlo says arose the 
doctrine of ideas which the platonista hold for they 


tsrtavlxil 



plato 


 


assented to the opinion of heraolitus that all sensible 
objects are in a constant state of flux so that if 
there is to be any knowledge and scnence it must 
be concerning some permanent natures different from 
the sensible natures of objects for there can be no 
permanent science respecting that which is perpetu 
ally changing it happened that socrates turned his 
speculations to the moral virtues and was the first 
philosopher wlio endeavoured to give universal defi 
nitions of such matters he wished to reason sys 
tematically and therefore h tried to cstabfrsh defi 
nitions for definitions are the basfr of stematic 
reasoning there are two things which may justly 
bo looked upon as steps in philosophy due to socrates 
inductive rejisonings and universal definitions — both 
of them steps which belong to the foundations of 
science socrates however did not make universals 
or definitions sepamble from the objects but his fol 
loweis separated them and these essences they termed 
ideas and the same account is given by other 
writers® ‘‘ some existences are sensible some intel 
ligible and according to plato if we wish to under 
stand the principles of things we must first separate 
the idem from the things such as the ideas of simi 
larity unity number magnitude position motion 
second that we mnst assume an absolute fair rood 
just aud the like third that we must consider the 
ideas of relation as knowdedge power recollecting 
that the things which we jerceive have this or that 
appellation applied to them because they partake of 
this or that idea those things leingyus which par 
ticipate in the idea of the just those being heautifid 
which contain the idea of the beautifril” and many 
of the arguments by which this doctrine was main 
tain are to be found in the platonic dialogues thus 
the opinion that true knowledge consists in sensation 
which had been asserted by protagoras and others is 
refuted in the theasutua and we may add so vic 
toriously lefuted that the arguments there pub forth 


 diog imi kic plat 




 


philosophy of discovert 


have ever since exercised a strong influence upon the 
speculative world it may bo remarked that in the 
minds of plato and of those who have since pursued 
the same paths of speculation the interest of such dis 
cussions as those we are now referring to was by no 
means limited to their bearing upon mere theory but 
was closely connected with those great questions of 
morals which have always a practical import those 
who assorted that the only foundation of knowlclgc 
was sensation asserted also that the only foundation of 
virtue as the euire ofpleaaure and in plato the 
metaphysical part of the disquisitions concerning know 
ledge in general though independent in its principles 
always seems to le subordinate in its purose to the 
questions ooncembi the knowlelge ot our duty 

since plato thus looked utou the ideas which were 
involved in each department of knowledge as forming 
its only essential part it was natural that he should 
look upon the study of ideas as the true mode of pur 
suing knowledge this he himself describes in the 
phuv “ the best way of amving at truth is not 
veiy difficult to point oul but most haid to pumie 
all the arts which have ever boon discovered were 
revealed in this manner it is a gift of the gods to 
man which as i conceive they sent down by some 
prometheus as by prometheus they gave us the light 
of are and the ancients more clearsighted than we 
and less removed from the gods handed down tliis 
traditionary doctrine tliat whatever is said to be 
cornea of one and of miiny and comprehends in it 
itself the finite and the infinite in coalition being 
one kind and consisting of infinite individuals 
and this being the state of things we must in each 
case endeavour to seize the one idea the idea of the 
kind as the chief point for we shall find that it is 
there and when we have seized this one thing we 
may then consider how it comprehends in itself two 
or three or any other number and again examine 
each f these ramifications separately till at last we 


 t il pi c d ed bekker t v pw 




plato 


 

perceive not only that one is at the some time one 
and many but also liow many and when we have 
thus filled up the interval between the infinite and 
the one we may consider that we have done with 
each one the gods then as i have said taught us 
by tradition thus to contemplate and to learn and to 
teach one another but the philosophers of the pre 
sent day seize upon the one at hazard too soon or too 
late and then immediately snatch at the infinite but 
the intermediate steps escape them in which resides 
the distinction between a tily logical anda mcie 
disputatious discussion” 

it would seem that what the author here describes 
as the most perfect form of exiositiou is that which 
refers each object to its place ina classification con 
taining a complete series of subordinations and which 
gives a definition of each class we have repeatedly 
remarked that in sciences of classification each now 
definition which gives a tenable and distinct separation 
of classes is an important advance in our knowledge 
but that su h definitions are rather the last than the 
first htoj in each advanca in the progress of real 
knowhidge these definitions are always the results of 
a laborious study of individual cases and are never 
arrived at by a pure effort of though which is what 
plato appears to have imagined as the true mode of 
philosophizing and still less do the advances of other 
sciences consist in seiziug at once upon the highest 
generality and filling in afterwords all the interme 
diate steps between that and the special instances on 
the contrary as we have seen the ascents from par 
ticular to general are all successive and each step of 
this ascent requires time and labour and a patient 
examination of actual facts and objects 

it would of course be absurd to blame plato for 
having inadequate views of the nature of progressive 
knowledge at the time when knowledge could hardly 
be said to have begun its progress but we already 
find in his sjteoulations as appears in the pssages 
just quoted from his writings several points brought 
into view which will require our continued attention 



 


philosophy op discovery 


as we proceed in oyerlooking the necessity of a 
gradual and successive advance from the lees general 
to the more general truths plato dbared in a mness 
of vision which prevailed among philosophers to the 
time of francis bacon in thinking too slightly 
of the study of actual nature he manifested a bias 
from which the human intellect freed itself in the 
vigorous struggles which terminated the dark ages 
in pointing out that all knowledge implies a unity of 
what we observe as manifold which unity is given by 
the mid plato taugho a lesson which has of late 
been too obscurely acknowledged the recoil by which 
men repair their long neglect of facts having car 
 ried them for a while so far as to think that facts 
wore the whole of our knowledge and in analysing 
this principle of unity by which we thus connect 
sensible things into vaiious ideas such as number 
llgnitude position motion he made a highly im 
portant step which it has been the business of philo 
sophers in succeeding times to complete and to follow 
out 

but the efficacy of plato’s speculations in their 
bearing upon physical science and upon theory in 
geneiul was much weakened by the confusion of 
practical with theoretical knowledge which arose from 
the ethical propensities of the cratic school in 
the platonic dialogues art and science are constantly 
spoken of indiscriminately the skill possessed by 
the painter the architect the shoemaker is consi 
dered as a just examine of human science no less 
than the knowledge which the geometer or the astro 
nomer possesses of the theoretical truths with which 
he is conversant not only so but traditionary and 
mythological tales mystical imaginations and ntaati 
cal etymologiei are mixed up as no less choice in 
gredients with the most acute logical analyses and 
ae most exact conduct of metaphysical controversies 
there is no distinction made between the knowledge 
possessed by the theoretical psychologist and the 


 seetheieiiiaiiuoathlipbnmlntheimxtchftpker 




plato 


 


pliyinan the philosophical teacher of morals and the 
legislator or the administrator of law thi indeed 
is the less to be wondered at since even in our own 
time the samte confusion is very commonly made by 
persons not otherwise ignorant or uncultur 

on the other hand we may remark finally that 
platons admiration of ideas was not a barren imagina 
tion even so far as regarded physical science fbr 
as we have segn he had a very important share in 
the introduction of the theory of epicycles having 
been the first to propose to sistronomers in a distinct 
form the problem of which that theofy was the solu 
tion namely “ to explain the celestial phenomena by 
the combination of equable circular motfbns” this 
demand of an ideal hypothesis which should exactly 
express the phenomena as well as they could tlien be 
observed and from which by the interposition of 
suitable steps all special cases might be deduced falls 
in well with those views respecting the proper mode 
of scekinff knowledge which we have quoted from the 
fhilebus and the idea which couhl thus represent 
and replace all the particular facts being not only 
sought but found we may readily suppose that the 
philosopher was by this event strongly confirmed in 
his persuasion that such an idea was indeed what the 
inquirer ought to seek lu this conviction all his 
genuine fillowers up to modern times luive partici 
pated and thus though they have avoided the error 
of those who hold that facts alone are valuable as the 
elements of our knowledge they have frequently run 
into the opposite error of too much despising and 
neglecting facta and of thinking that the business of 
tbe inquirer after truth was only a profound and con 
stant contemplation of the conceptions of his own 
mind but of this hereafter

aldditioxal remarks on plato 


t he leading points in plato’s writings which bear 
upon the philosophy of discoveiy are these 

i the docirine of ideas 

 the doctrine of the one and the many 

 the notiou of the nature and aim of science 

 the survey of existing sciences 

i the doctrine of ideas is an attempt to solve a 
problem which in all ages forces itself upon the notice 
of thoughtful men namely how can certain and 
peimanent knowledge be possible for man since all 
his knowledge miistbe derived from traihicnt and 
fluctuating sensations and the answer given by this 
doctrine is that certain and pennanent knowledge is 
kwt derived from sefimatiom but from ideas there 
are in the mind certain elements of knowledge which 
are not derived from sensation and are only imper 
fectly exemplified in sensible objects and when we 
reason concerning sensible things so as to obtain real 
knowledge we do so by considering such things as 
partaking of the qualities of the ideas concerning 
which there can be truth the sciences of geometiy 
and arithmetic show that there ore truths which 
man can know and the doctrine of ideas explains 
how this is possible 

so far the doctrine of ideas answers its primajw 
purpose and is a reply by no means the least intel 
ligible and satisfactory reply to a question still agi 
tated among philosophers what is the ground of 
geometrical and other necessary tmtht 

but plato seems in many of writings to extend 
this doctrine much further and to assume not only 
ideas of space and its properties from which geome 



additional remarks on plato 

trical truths are derived but of belations as the 
relations of like and unlike greater and liess and 
of mere material objects tables and chairs now 
to assume ideas of such things as these solves no dif 
ficulty and is supported by no argument in this 
respect the ideal theory is of no value in science 

it is curious that we have a very acute refutation 
of the ideal theory in this sense not only in aristotle 
the open opponent of plato on this subject but in the 
platonic writings themselves namely in the dialogue 
entitled parmenides which fa this lyxd on other ac 
counts i consider to be the work not of plato but of 
an opponent of plato 

 have spoken in the preceding chapter of 
plato’s doctrine that truth is to be obtained by dis 
cerning the one in the many this expression is 
used it would seem in a somewhat large and fluctuat 
ing way to mean several things as for instance 
finding the one kind in many individilah for in 
stance the one idea of dog inmany dogs or the 
one law in many pheminmia for instance the eccen 
trics and epicycles in many planets in any inter 
pretation it is too loose and indefinite a rule to be of 
much value in the formation of sciences though it 
has been recently again propounded as important in 
modem times 

 i have said in the preceding chapter that 
plato though he saw that scientific truths of great 
geneitdity might be obtained and were to be arrived 
at by philosophers overlooked the necessity of a pra 
dual and mccesmyc advance from the less general to 
the more general and i have described this as a 

dimness of vision’ i must now acknowledge that this 
is not a very appropriate phrase for not only no 
acuteness of vision could have enabled plato to see 
that gradual generalization in science of which as yet 
tio eicample ld appeared but it was very fortunate 
fmr the progress of truth at that time that plato had 
imagined to himself the object of science to be gdheral

and sublime truths which prove thomselves to be true 
by the light of their own generality and symmetry 
it is worth while to illustrate this notice of plato by 
some references to his writings 

in the sixth book of the repuhli plato treats of 
the then existing sciences as the instruments of a 
philosophical education among the most conspicu 
ous of these is astronomy he there ridicules the 
notion that astronomy is a sublime science because it 
makes men look upward he asserts that the really 
sublime science is thatvhich makes men look at the 
realuiesy which are suggested by the appearances seen 
in the heavens namely the spheres which revolve and 
carry the luminaries in their revolutions now it was 
no doubt the detemined search for such realities” 
as these which gave birth to the greek asironmiy 
that first and critical step in the progress of science 
plato by his exhortations if not by his suggestions 
contributed efiectually as i conceive to this step in 
science in the samift manner he requires a science of 
harmonics which shall be fice from the defects and 
inaccuracies which occur in actual instruments this 
belief that the universe was full of mathematical rela 
tions and that these were the true objects of scientific 
research gave a vigour largeness of mind and con 
fidence to the greek speculators which no moie cau 
tious view of the problem of scientific discovery could 
have supplied it was well that this advanced guard 
in the army of discoverers was filled with indomitable 
courage boundless hopes and creative minds 

but we must not forget that this disposition to 
what bacon calls ciruicipuicm was full of danger as 
well as of hope it led plato into error as it led 
kepler afterwards and many others in all ages of 
scientific activity it led plato into error for in 
stance when it led him to assert in the tiknasm that 
the four elements earth air fire and water have 
for the forms of their particles respectively the cub 
the fcosahedron the pyramid and tiie octahedron 
and again when h led him to despise the practical 
controversies of the musidans of his time wmoh con 



additional remaeks on plato 


troversies were in £sust the proof of the truth of the 
mathematical theory of harmonics and in like man 
ner it led kepler into error when it led him to believe 
that he had found the reason of the number size and 
motion of the planetary orbits in the application of 
the five regular solids to the frame of the universe” 

how far the caution in fbrming hypotheses which 
bacon’s writings urge upon us is more severe than 
suits the present prospects of science we may hereafter 
consider but it is plainly very conceivable that a 
boldness in the invention and application of hyo 
theses which was propitious to science in its infancy 
may be one of the greatest dangcra of its more mature 
period and further that the happy effect of such a 
temper depended entirely upon tli candour skill and 
labour widi which the hypotheses were compared with 
the observed phenomena 

 plato has given a survey of the sciences of his 
time s francis bacon has of his indeed plato has 
given two such surveys one in the republic in 
ieviewing as i have said the dements of a philoso 
phical education the other in the tiniceusy as the 
portions of a theological view of the uiiivei’so — such 
as has been called a theodiema a justification of god 
in the former passage of plato the sciences enume 
rated are arithmetic plane geometry solid geometry 
astronomy and haimonics” in the timmus we have 
a further notice of many other subjects in a way 
which is intended i conceive to include such know 
ledge as plato had then airiv at on the various parts 
of the universe the subjects there referred to are 
as i have elsewhere stated these light and heat 
water ice gold geni rust and other natural objects 
odours taste rearing lights colour and the powers 
of sense in general the parts and organs of the body

tion and in short every obvious point of physiology 
but the opinions thus delivered in the timasua on 
latter subject have little to do with the pihgfes of 
real knowledga the doctrines on the other hand 
which depend upon geometiical and arithmetioal rela 
tions are portions or prdudes of the sciences which 
the fulness of time brought forth 

 may as further bearing upon the pltonic 

notion of science notice platos view of the constitu 
tion of the human miiidc according to him the ideas 
which are the constituents of science form an intel 
ligible world while the visible and tangible things 
which we perceive by our senses form the visible 
world in the visible world we have shadows and 
reflections of actual objects and by those sliadows and 
i’eflectionswe may judge of the objects even when we 
cannot do so directly as when men in a dark cavern 
judge of external objects by the shadows which they 
cast into the cavern in like manner in the intelli 
gible world there are conceptions which are the usual 
objects of human thought and about which we reason 
but these are only shadow and reflections of the ideas 
which are the real sources of truth and the beason 
ing faculty the discursive beason the logosy which 
thus deals with conceptions is subordinate to the in 
tuitive faculty the intuitive beason the nousy which 
apprehends ideas this recognition of a faculty in 
man wliich contemplates the foundations — the fundor 
tmntal ideas — of science and by apprehending such 
ideas makt science possible is consentaneous to the 
diilosophy which i have all along presented as the 
view taught us by a careful study of the hisiry and 
nature of science that new fundamental ideas are 
unfolded and the intuitive faculty developed and 
enlarged by the progress of science and by an intimate 
acquaintance wi its ieasonings plato appears to have 
discerned in some measure though dimly and this 
is th less wondeiful inasmuch this gradual and

successive extension of the field of intuitive truth in 
proportion as we become familiar with a larger amount 
of derived truth is even now accepted by few though 
proved by the reasonings of the greatest scientific d 
coverers in every age 

the leading defect in plato’s view of the nature of 
real science is his not seeing fully the extent to which 
experience and observation are the basis of all our 
knowledge of the universe he considers the lumina 
ries which appear in the heavens to be not the true 
objects of astronomy but only some imperfect adum 
bration of them — mere diagrams which may assist us 
in the study of a higher truth as beautiful diagrams 
might illustrate the truths of geometry but would not 
prove them tliis notion of an astronomy wliich is an 
astronomy of theories and not of facts is not tenable 
for theories are facts theories and facts are equally 
real true tlicories are facts and facts are familiar 
theories • but when plato says that astronomy is a 
series of problems suggested by visible things he uses 
expressions quite conformable to the time philosophy 
of science and the like is tnie of all other sciences

chapter iv 
aristotije 


t he views of aristotle with regard to the founda 
tions of human knowledge are very different from 
those of his tutor platcj and are even by himself put 
in opposition iso them he dissents altogether from 
the platonic doctrine that ideas are the true materials 
of our knowledge and after giving respecting the 
origin of this doctrine the account wliich we quoted 
in the last chapter he goes on to reason against it 
thus” he says “they devised ideas of all things 
which are spoken of as universals much as if any 
one having to count a number of objects should think 
that he could not do it while they were few and 
should expect to count them by making them more 
numerous for the kinds of tilings arc almost more 
numerous than the special sensible objects by seeking 
the causes of wliich they were led to their ideas” he 
then goes on to urgeveveral other reasons against the 
assumption of ideas and the use of them in philoso 
phical researches 

aristotle liimself establishes his doctrines by trains 
of reasoning but reasoning must proceed from cer 
tain first principles and the question then arises 
whence are those first principles obtained to this 
he replies that they are the result of jsxperience and 
he even employs the same technical expression by 
which we at this day describe the process of collecting 
these principles from observed fiicts — that they are 
obtained by inductim i have alry quoted pas 
sages in which this statement is made “ the way 
of reasoning” he says “is the same in philosophy 


 metagph xll sev b i c ul sect a 

 analyt prior 




abistotle 


 

and in any art or science we must collect the facts 
ra wrapovtci and the things to which the facts hap 
pen and must have as large a supply of these as 
kssiblc and then we must examine them according 
to the terms of our syllogisms” “there are peculiar 
principles in each science and in each case these 
principles must be obtained from experience thus 
astronomical observation supplies the principles of 
astronomical science for the phenomena being 
rightly taken the deinofistrations of astronomy were 
discovered and the same is flic case with any other 
ait or science bo that if the facts in each case be 
taken it is our business to construct the demonstra 
tions for if in our natural history icara rijv toro 
piav we have omitted none of the facts and proerties 
which belong to the subject we shall learn what we 
can demonstrate and what wo cannot” and again 
“it is manifest that if any sensation be wanting 
there must be some knowledge wanting which we are 
thus prevented from having for we acquire know 
ledge either hy induction itrayuryff or by demonstra 
tion and demonstration is from universals but in 
duction from paiiiculars it is impossible to have 
universial theoretical propositions except by induction 
and we cannot make inductions without having sen 
sation for sensation has to do with particulars” 

it is easy to show that aristotle uses the term 
induction sis we use it to express the process of 
collecting a gcneial proposition fiom particular cases 
in which it is exemplified thus in a passage which 
we have already quoted he says “induction and 
syllogism from induction is when we attribute one 
extreme term to the middle by means of the other” 
the import of this technical phraseology will further 
appear by the example which he gives “we find 
tixta seveial animals which ai deficient in bile aie 
longlived as man the horse the mule hence we 
infer that all animals which are deficient in bile are 
jonglived”

philosophy op discovert 


we may observe however that both aristotle’s 
notion of inductioi and many other parts of his 
philosophy are obscure and imperfect in consequence 
of his refusing to contemplate ideas as sbnsothiag 
distinct from sensation it thus happens that he 
always assumes the ideas which enter into his ropoa 
tion as given and considers it as the philosopher’s 
business to determine whether such propositions are 
true or not whereas the most important feature in 
induction is as we have saib the injtroduction of a 
new idea and pot its tmployment when once intro 
duced that the mind in this manner gives unity to 
that which is manifold — that we are thus led to specu 
lative principles which have an evidence jiigher than 
any othei — and that a peculiar sagacity in some men 
seizes upon the conceptions by which the facts may be 
bound into true propositions — are doctrines which 
form no essential part of the philosophy of the stagirite 
although such views are sometimes recognized more 
ov less clearly in his expressions thus he says 

there can be no knowledge when the sensation does 
not continue in the mind for this purpose it is 
necessary both to perceive and to have some unity in 
the mind auroavofiiwois ctv cv rc iy rg xs i 
many such perceptions having taken place some 
difference is then perceived and fiom the remem 
brance of these arises reason thus from sensation 
comes memory and from memory of the same thing 
often repeated comes experience for many acts of 
memory make up one experience and fiom exie 
rience or from any universal notion which takes a 
permanent place in the mindrom the unity in the 
momifold the same some one thing being found in 
many fact — brings the first principle of art and of 
science of art if it be employed about production 
of srienoe if alxiut existmice” 

 awuyt joet it this conreetton ctoss not disturb iho 

 bat the best reading seems to be general sense of the passage that 
not button and the danse must the ilrst piindpies of science are 
be rendered “both to perceive and to obtained by finding the one in the

aristotle 


 


i tvill add to this aristotle’s notice of sagacity 
since ajthough little or no further reference is made 
to this quality in his phuosophy the passage fixes our 
attention upon an important step in the formation of 
knowledge ‘sagacity” dyxvoia he says® “is a 
hitting by guess cvoroxui ns upon the middle term 
the conception common to two oases in an inapprecia 
ble time as for example if any one seeing that the 
bright side of the moon is always towards the sun 
suddenly perceives why this is namely because the 
moon shines by the light of the sun — or if he sees 
a ierson talking with a rich man he guesses that he 
is boitowing money — or conjectures that two persons 
are friends because they are enemies of the same 
person’ — to consider only the first of these exam 
ples — the conception heic introduced that of a body 
shining by the light which another casts ukn it is 
hot contained in the observed facts but introduced 
by the mind it is in shorty that conception which 
in the act of induction the mind superadds to the phe 
nomena as they are presented by the senses and to 
invent such appropriate conceptions such “enstoclues” 
is indeed the precise office of inductive sagacity 

at the end of this work the loer analytics 
aristotle ascribes our knowledge of principles to in 
tellect ioos or as it appears necessary to translate 
the woixi intuition “ since of our intellectual habits 
by which we aim at truth some are always true but 
some admit of being false as opinion and beasoning but 
science and intuition are always true and since there 
is nothing which is more certain than science except 
intuition and since principles are better known to 
tis than ike deductions them and since all 
science is connected by reasoning we cannot have 
science restoling principles considering this then 
and that tne beginning of demonstration cannot be 
demonstration nor the beginning of science science 
and since as we have said there is no other kind of 
truth intuition must be the beginning of science”

what is hei said is no doubt in accordance with 
the doctnnes which we have endeavoured to establish 
respecting the nature of science if by this intpiiioiih 
we understand that contemplation of certain funda 
mental ideas which is the basis of all rigorous know 
ledge but notwithstanding this apparent approxi 
mation aristotle was far from having an habitual 
and practical possession of the principles which he 
thus touches upon he did not in reality construct 
his philosophy by giving unity to that vvhich was 
manifold or bjrseewngin intuition principles whicli 
might be the basis of demonstration nor did he col 
led in each subject fundamental propositions by an 
induction of particulars ho rather endeavoured to 
divide than to unite he employed himself not in 
combining fiicts but in analysing notions and the 
criterion to which lie referred his analysis was not 
the facta of our experience but our habits of lan 
guage thus his opinions rested not upon sound 
inductions gathered in each case from the phenomena 
by means of approjriate ideas but upon the loose 
and vague generalizations which are implied in the 
common use of speech 

yet aristotle was so far consistent with his own 
doctrine of the derivation of knowledge from expe 
rience that he made in almost every province of human 
knowledge a vast collection of such special facts as 
the experience of his time supplied these collections 
are almost unrivalled even to the present day espe 
cially in natural history in other departments when 
to the facis we must add the tight inductive idea in 
order to obtain truth we find little of value in the 
aristotelic works but in those parts which refer to 
natural history we find not only an immense and 
varied couection of facts and observatione but a saga 
city and acuteness in classification which it is impos 
sible not to admire this indeed ipears to have ln 
the post eminent faculty in aristotles mina 

the influence of aristotle in succeeding ages will 
come under our notice portly 



chapter v 


additional reuabks on aristotle 


i ne of the most conspicuous points in alie 
va totle doctrines as beanng upon tlie philosophy 
of science is his account of that ode of attaining 
truth which is called induction for we are accustomed 
to consider induction as the process by which our 
sciences have been formed and we call them collect 
ively the hiductive sciences aristotle often speaks of 
induction hm for instance when he says that socrates 
introduced the frequent use of it but the caidinal 
passage on this subject is in his analytics in which he 
compares syllogism and induction as two modes of 
drawing conclusions he there says that all lielief 
aiises either from syllogism or from induction and 
adds that induction is when by means of one extreme 
term we infer the other extreme to be true of the 
middle term the example which he gives is this 
knowing that particular animals are longlived as 
elephant horse mule and finding that these animals 
aee in having no gallbladder we infer by inr 
fmdixmy that all animals which have no gallbladder 
are longlived this may be done he says if the 
middle and the second extreme are convertible as 
the following formal statement may show 

mephant horse mule ac are longlived 

elephant horse mole ac are all gallless 

if we might convert this proposition and say 
all gallless animala are as elephant horse ijule 
aa 


 anolyt prior u 



 philosophy op discovervt 

ve might infer syllogistaily that 

all gdlllesb animus are longlived 

and though we cannot infer this nyllogisticallj we 
infer it by induction when we have a sufficient 
amount of instances 

i have already elsewhere given this account of in 
duction as a process employ in the formation of our 
knowledge what i have now to remark concerning 
aristotle is that it does not appear to have occurred 
to him that in establishing such a proposition as that 
which he gives as his distance the main difficulty is 
the dicovery of a middle term which will allow us to 
firame such a proposition as we need the zoologist 
who wanted to knpw what kind of animals are long 
lived might guess long before he guessed that the 
absence the gallbladder suppli the requisite 
middle term if e proposition were true which it 
is not and in like manner in other cases it is diffi 
cult to find a middle term which enables us to collect 
a proposition by induction and herein consists the 
imperfection of his view of the subject which con 
siders the main point to be the proof of the proposition 
when the conceptions are given whereas the main 
point really is the disoovery of conceptions which will 
make a true proposition possible 

 since the maia characteristic of the steps 
which have occurred in the formation of tlie physi 
sciences is not merely that they are propositions col 
lected by induction but by the introduction of a new 
conception it has been suggested that it is not a 
chararistio designation of these sdencea to call them 
indiwuve ikimeea almost every discovery involves 
in it the introduction of a new conception as the ele 
ment of a new proposition and the novelty of the 
conception is more characteristio of the stages of disco 
veiy than the inductive application of it hence as

bearing upon tbe philogophy of disooveiy the state 
ments of aristotle eonceming induction thaigh acute 
and vftluaue are not so valuable as they might seem 
even francis bacon it has been asserted erred in the 
same way and of course with less euse in asserting 
induction of a certain kind to be ihe great instrument 
for the promotion of knowledge and in overlooking 
the necessiiy of the iiwmtum which gives induction 
its value 

 the invention or discovery of a conception by 
winch many facts of observation conjoined so 
as to make them the materials of a proposition is 
called in plato as we have finding tlw om in the 
many 

in the passage quoted from the lateir analytics 
aristotle uses the same expression imd speaks yty 
justly respecting the forqation of knowledge indeed 
the tulea of the chapters of this and many parts of 
aristotle’s works would lead us to expect just such a 
philosophy of discovery as is the object of our study 
at present thus we have anal poet b il chap 
“ how we are to hunt ciktv the predications of a 
deiimtion” chap precepts for the invention 
of problems and of a middle term” and the like 
but vrfien we come to read these chapters they con 
tain little that is of value and resolve themselves 
mostly into permutations of aristotle’s logical phraseo 
logy 

 the part of the aristotelian diilosophy which 
has most permanently retained its place in modem 
sdences is a part of which a use has been made quite 
different from that which was originally contemplated 
the five words” which are explained in the intro 
duction to aristotle’s categories namely the words 
qsnus species ihfifermee property acddemtt were in 
troduced mainly that they might used in toe propo 
sitions of which syllogisms consist and might thus be 
toe elements of reasoning but it has so happened 
that these wcurds are rarely used in ficiences of 
beasoning but are abundantly and commonly used in

speaking of the classificatory sciences 

 of aristotle’s actual contributions to the physt

sciences i have stated that he conceived the globu

the arguments for that doctrine that wo may look 
upon him as the most eifective teacher of it also in 
the appentlix to that history published in the third 
edition i have given aristotle’s account of the rain

to astrology he remarks only that the revolution 
of the heaven itself the outermost revolution is simple 
and the quickest of all that the revolutions of the 
others are slower each moving in a direction opposite 
to the heaven in its own circle and that it is reason 
able that those which are nearest to the first revolu

own circle and those that are fiirtbest off the least 
time and the intermediate ones in the order of their

nomers eudoxus and oauppus fer the explanation of 
the phenomena presented by the sun moon and pla 
nets he says amount to fifty five and this he 

says must be the number of essences and principles 
which exist in the universe 

 in the sciences of classification and especially 
in the classification of animals higher claims have 
been made for aristotio which i have diseased in 
the history i have there attempted to show that 
aristotle’s classification inasmuch as it enumerates au 
the parts of animals may be stid to certain the 
rials of every subsequent classification but that it can 
not bo said to anticipate any modem system because 
the different grades of classification are not made mh 
ordinate to one another as a system of classification 
reuires i have the satisfimtion of finding mr owen 
agreeing with me in these views 

 francis bacon’s criticism on aristotle which i 
have quoted in the apindix to the history is 
severe and i think evidently the result of prejudice 
he disparages aristotle in comparison with the other 
philosopheis of greeca their systems he says ‘ had 
some savour of experience and nature and bodily 
things wldle the physics of aristotle in general 
sound only of logical terms 

‘nor let any one be moved by this that in his 
books of animals and in his probletns and in others 
of his tracts there is often a quoting of experiments 
for he had made up his mind beforehand and did not 
consult experience in order to make light propositions 
and axioms but when he had settled his system to his 
will he twisted experience round and made her bend 
to his system 

i do not think that this can be said with any truth 
i know no instances in laiich aristotle has twisted ex 
perience round and made her bend to his system lu

im prmema he is so far om giving dogmatical solu 
tions of mbiq questions proposed that in most cases he 
propounds two or three solutions as mere suggestions 
and conjectures and both in his history of animals 
as i have said and in others of his works the want of 
system gives tliem au incdierent and tumultuary cha 
racter which even a false system would have advan 
tageously removed for as i have said elsewhere it is 
easier to translate a system into a true one than 
to introduce system into a muss of confusion 

 it is cupous thht a fundamental error into 
which aristotle fell in his view of the conditions 
which deteiminc the formation of science is very 
niy the same as one of francis bacon’s leading 
mistakes aristotle says that science consists in 
knowing the catiaes of things as bacon aims at ac 
quiring a knowledge of theiwww or essences of things 
and their qualities but the history of all the sciences 
teaches us that sciences do not begin with such know 
ledge and that in few cases only do they ever attain to 
it sciences begin by a knowledge of the laws otplie 
wmeiia and proceed by the discovciy of the scientific 
ideas by which the phenomena are colligated as i 
have shown in other works the discovmy of causes 
is not beyond the humap powers as some have 
taught those who thus speak disregard the lessons 
taught by the histoiy of physical astronomy of 
oology of physical optics thermotics and other 
sciences but ie discovery of causes and of the 
essential forms of qualities is a triumph reserved for 
the later stages of each science when the knowledge 
of the laws of phenomena has already made great 
progress it was not to be expected that aristotle 
would discern this truth when as yet there was no 
science extant in whidi it haft been exemplified yet

additional remarks on aristotle g 

itf as aristotle wished to do the ultimate causes of 
the motions of the universe could only mislead the 
aristotelian maxim which sounds so plausible and 
has been so generally accepted that to know truly is 
to know the causes of things” is a bad guide in 
scientific research instead of it we might substitute 
this that though we may iispire to know at last 
why things are we must be content for a long time 
with knowing how they ara” 

 hence if we are asked whether plato or 
aristctle had the truer viewssof the nature and pro 
perty of science we must give the prorence to plato 
for though his notion of a real intelligible world of 
which the visible world was a fleeting and changeable 
shadow was extravagant yet it led him to seek to 
determine the forms of the intelligible things which 
are really the laws of visible phenomena while aris 
totle was led to jass lightly over such laws because 
tliey did not at once reveal the causes which produced 
the phenomena 

 aristotle throughout his works takes numerous 
occasions to argue against plato’s doctrine of ideas 
yet these ideas so far as they were the intelligible 
porms of visible things were really fit objects of 
philosophical research j and the search after them had 
a powerful influence in promoting the progress of 
science and we may see in the effect of this seatoh 
the answer to many of aristotle’s strongest argu 
ments for instance aiistotle says that plato by 
way of explaining things adds to them as many 
ideas and that this is just as if a man having to 
reckon a large number were to begin by adding to it 
another laige number it is plain that to this we 
may reply that the adopting the ideas of cycles along 
with the motions of theplaneta does really explmn 
the motions and that the cycles are not simply added 
to the phenomena but include and supersede phe 
nomena a finite number of cycles include 

sent an infinite number of separate phenomena 

to aristotle’s argument ideas cannot be the 
causes or principles of tungs we should reply that

tliough they cannot be this they may nevertheless be 
and must be the conditions and principles of our 
knowledge which is what we want them to be

t hus whue plato was disposed to seek the essence 
of our knowledge in ideas alone aristotle slight 
ing this source of truth looked to experience as the 
beginning of science and he attempted to obtain by 
division and deduction all that experience did not 
immediately supply and thus with these two great 
names began that struggle of opposite ohuions which 
has ever since that time agitated the speculative world 
as men have urged the claims of ideas or of expe 
rience to our respect and as alternately each of those 
elements of knowledge has been devated above its due 
place while the other has been unduly depressed we 
shall sec the successive turns of this balanced struggle 
in the remaining portionis of this ieview 

but w may observe that piactically the influence 
of plato predominated rather than that of aristotle 
in the remaining part of the history of ancient philo 
sophy it was indeed on habitual subject of dispute 
among men of letters whether the sources of true 
knowledge are to be found in the senses or in the 
mind the epicureans taking one side of this alterna 
tive and the academics another while the stoics in 
a certain manner included both elements in their view 
but none of these sects showed their persuasion that 
the materials of knowledge were to found in the 
domain of sense by seeking them there no one 
appears to have thought of following the example of 
aristotle and gathering together a store of pbrorved 
facta we may except perhaps assertions bdonng 
to some provinces of natural history which were 
gouected by various writers but in these the mixed

character of the statements the want of discrimination 
in the estimate of evidence th credulity and love of 
the marvellous which the authors for the most part 
displayed showed that instead of improving upon the 
example of aristotle they were wandering further 
and foithor from the path of real knowled and 
while they thus collected with so little judgment 
such statements as offered themselves it hardly ap 
pears to have occurred to any one to enlarge the stores 
of observation by the aid of experiment j and to learn 
what the laws of natuce were by trying what were 
their results in particular cases they u no instru 
ments for obtaining an insight into the constitution of 
the universe except logical stinetions and discussions 
and proceeded as if the phenomena familiar to their 
predecessors must contain all that was needed as a 
basis for natural philosophy by thus contenting 
themselves with the fects which the earlier jdiiloso 
phers had contemplated they were led also to confine 
themselves to the ideas which those philosophers had 
put forth for all the most remarkable alternatives 
of hypothesis so far as they could be constructed with 
a slight and common knowledge of phenomena had 
been promulgated by the acute and profound thinkers 
who gave the first impulse to philosophy and it was 
not given to man to add much to the original inven 
tions of their minds till he had undergone anew a long 
discipline of observation and of thout employed 
upon observation thus the later authors of the qreek 
whools bme little better than commentators oh 
the earlier and the commonplaces with which the 
different schools carried on their debates — the con 
stantly recurring argument with its known attendant 
answer — the distinctions dtown finer and finer and 
leading to nothing — render the specolatiions of those 
times a scholaetic philosophy in the same sense in 
which we employ the term when we apeak of the 
labours of the middle ages it will be understood

ktiovlecl whether the moral speculations of the 
ancient world were of the same stationaiy kind going 
their round in a limited circle like their metaphysics 
and physics must bo considered on some other occa 
sion 

mr grote iu his very interesting discussion of 
sociatess teaching notices also the teaching of hip 
pocrates which he conceives to have in one respect 
the same tendency as the philosophy of socrates 
namely to turn away from the vague aggregate of 
doctrines and guesses which ccftistitutod the pliysical 
philosophy of that time and to pursue instead a spe 
cial and more practical course of inquiry hippocrates 
selecting medicine and socrates selting ethics by 
this limitation of their subject they avoided some of 
the errors of their predecessors for as mr grote 
has also remarked “ the earlier speculators anaxa 
goras empedocles democritus the pythagoreans all 
had still present to their minds the vast and undivided 
problems which have been transmitted down from the 
old poets bonding their minds to the invention of 
some system which would explain them all at once or 
assist the imagination in conceiving both how the 
kosmos first began and how it continued to move on” 
there could be no better remedy for this ambitious 
erior of the human mind than to have a definite sub 
ject of study such as the diseases and the health of 
the human body accordingly we see that the study 
of medicine did draw its cultivators away from this 
ancient but unprofitable field hippocrates® condemns 
those who as empedocles set themselves to make out 
what man was from the beginning how he began first 
to exist and in what manner he was constructed 
this is he says no part of medicine in like manner 
he blames and refutes those who make some simple 
element hot or cold or moist or dry the cause of

diseases and give medical piecepts professing to be 
founded‘on this hypothesis 

these passages are marked by tho prudence which 
practical study suggests to a calm and clearsighted 
man they can hardly be said to have opened tho 
way to a science of medicine for in the sense in 
which we here use the word science namely a collec 
tion of geneiiil truths inferred from facts by successive 
discoverers we have even yet no science of medicine 
the question with regard to the number and nature 
of the elements of which bodies are composed began 
to be agitated as we have seen at a very early period 
of greek philosophy and continued long to be regarded 
as a chief point of physiological doctrine in galon’s 
work we have a treatise entitled on ifie elements 
according to hippocrates and the writer explains 
that though hipiocrates has not written any work 
with the title on the elements yet that he has in his 
treatise on ihe nntnre of man shown his opinion on 
that subject that the doctrine of the pour elements 
hot cold moist dry subsisted long in the schools 
we have evidence in galen he tells us that when 
he was a student of nineteen yeais old a teacher urged 
this lore upon him and regarded him as very conten 
tious and perverse because he offered objections to 
it his account of the dialogue between him and the 
teacher is curious but in hippocrates the doctrine 
of these four elements is replaced in a great measure 
by the doctrine of the pour humours of which the 
human body is constituted namely blood phlegm 
yellow bile and black bile galen dwells with em 
phasis upon hippocrates’s proof that there must be 
more than one such element 

what” he asks is the method of finding the 
elements of bodies there can in my opinion be 
no other than that which was introduced by hippo 
crates namely we must inquire whether there be only 
one element eveiy where the same in kind or whether 


llbla •dreieiikia 

 in fornwreitltloiui i hste sot dotidjaiitlos to this passage 




th£ latee greeks 


 


there are more than one various and unlike each 
other and if the element be not one only but 
several various and dissimilar ve must inquire in 
the second place how many elements there are and 
what and of what kind they are and how related in 
their association 

now that the first merafeiit is not one only of 
which both oiir bodies and those of all other creatures 
were produced hippocrates shows from these consi 
derations and it is better first to put down his own 
expressions and then to expoflnd them ‘ i assert that 
if man consisted of one element only he could not fall 
sick for there would be nothing which could derange 
his health if he were all of one ijement 

the doctrine of one element did not prevail much 
after the time of hippocrates the doctrine of four 
elements continued as i have said long to hold pos 
session of the schools but does not appear as an 
important part of the doctrine of hippocrates the 
doctrine of the four humouia blood phlegm yel 
low bile and black bile is more peculiarly his and 
long retained its place as a principle of physiological 
science 

but we arc liere not so much concerned with his 
discoveries in medicine as with his views respecting 
the method of acquiring sound knowledge and in this 
respect as has been said he iecommen by his prac 
tice a prudent limitation of the field of inquiry a 
rejection of wide ambitious general assertions and a 
practical study of his proper field 

in ascribing these merits to hippocrates’s medical 
speculations as to the ethical speculations of his con 
temporary socrates we assign considerable philosophi 
cal value to hippocrates no less than to socrates 
these merits were at that time the great virtues of 
physieal as well as of ethical philosophy but as 
hr grote well observes the community of diarar 
which then subsisted between the physical and ethical 
speculations prevailing at that time ceased to ob 
in later times indeed it coas to exist just 
at that time in consequence of the establishment of

flcientifio astronomy by tbe exertions of plato and his 
contemporaries from that time the common sense 
as we call it of a man like socrates though it might 
be a good guide in ethics was not a good guide in phy 
sics i have shown elsewhere how the common sense 
of socrates was worthless in matters of astronomy 
from that time one of the great intellectual lessons 
was that in order to understand the external world we 
must indeed observe carefully but we must also guess 
boldly discovery here required an inventive mind 
like plato’s to deal with and arrange new and varied 
facts but in ethics all the facts were old and fami 
liar and the generalizations of language by which 
they were gi‘oujed virtues and vices and the like 
were common and wellknown words here was no 
room for invention and thus in the ethical specula 
tions of socrates or of any other moral teacher we 
are not to look tor any contributions to the philosophy 
of discovery 

nor do i find anything on this subject among later 
greek writers beyond the commendation of such in 
tellectual virtues as hippocrates and galen and other 
medical writers school by the practice of their art 
enjoined and praised but before we quit the ancients 
 will point out some peculiarities which may be noticed 
in the boman disciples of the greek philosophy

chapter vii 


the romans 


t he romans had no pliilosophy but that which 
they borrowed from tho ttreekand what they 
thus received they hardly made entirely their own 
the vast and profound question of which we hve 
been speaking the relation betwen existence and 
our knowledge of what exists they never appear to 
have fathomed even so far as to discern how wide 
and deep it is in the development of the ideas by 
winich natuie is to be understood they went no fir 
ther than their greek masters had gone nor indeed 
was more to be looked for and in the practical 
habit of accumulating observed facts as materials for 
knowledge they were much less discriminating and 
more credulous than their greek predecessors the 
descent from aristotle to pliny in the judiciousness 
of the authors and the value of their collections of 
facts is immense 

since the romans were thus servile followers of 
their greek teachers and little acquaintod with any 
example of new trutlis collected from the world around 
them it was not to be expected that they could have 
any just conception of that long and magnificent ascent 
from one set of truths to others of higher order and 
wider compass which the history of science began to 
exhibit when the human mind recovered its progres 
sive habits yet some dim presentiment of the splendid 
csireer thus destined for the intellect of man appears 
from time to time to have arisen in their minds per 
liaps the circumstance which most powerfully contri 
buted to suggest this vision was the vast intellectual 
pross which they were themselves conscious of 
having xnade through the introduction of the greek 



 philosophy of discovery 

philosophy and to this may be added perhaps some 
other features of national character their temper 
was too stubborn to acquiesce in the absolute authority 
of the greek philosophy although their minds were 
not inventive enough to establish a rival by its side 
and the wonderful progress of their political power 
had given them a hope in the progress of man which 
the greeks never possessed the homan as he be 
lieved the fortune of his state to be destined for 
eternity believed also in the immortal destiny and 
endless advancef that intellectual bepublic of wliich 
he had been admitted a denizen 

tt is easy to find examples of such feelings as i have 
endeavoured to describe the enthusiasm with which 
lucretius and virgil speak of physical knowledge 
manifestly arises in a great measure from the delight 
which they had f dt in lccoming acquainted with the 
greek tlicorios

to truths like these and scale the spangled skies 

far distant stars to clearest view they brought

so heaven is reached — not as of old they tried 
by mountains piled on mountains in their pride 

and from the whole tenour of these and fdmilar 
passages it is evident tliat iiiteljcctual pleasure 
which arises from our first introduction to a beautiful 
physical theory had a main share in producing this 
enthusiasm at the contemplation of the victories of 
science altliough undoubtedly the moral philosophy 
which was never separated from the natuial philosophy 
and the triumh over superstitious fears which a know 
ledge of nature was supposed to furnish abided warmth 
to the feeling of exultation 

we may trace a similar impression in the ardent 
expressions which pliny makes use of in speaking of 
the early astronomers and which we have quoted in 
the history “ great men elevated above the com 
mon standard of human nature by discovering the 
laws which celestial occurrences obey and by freeing 
the wretched mind of man from the fears which 
eclipses inspired” 

this exulting contemplation of what science had 
done naturally led the mind to an anticipation of 
further achievements still to be perfonnetl expres 
sions of this feeling occur in seneca and are of the 
most remarkable kind as the following example will 
show 

why do wc wonder that comets so rare a pheno 
menon have not yet had their laws assigned — that we 
should know so little of their beginning and their eu

 reckoned the stars and gave them names there 
are still many nations which are acquainted with the 
heavens by sight only which do not yet know why the 
moon disappears why she is eclipsed it is but lately 
that among us philosophy lias reduced these matters 
to a certainty the day shall come when the course 
of time and the labour of a maturer age shall bring 
to light what is yet concealed ono generation even 
if it devoted itself to the skies is not enough for re 
searches so extensive how then can it be so when 
we divide this scanty auoivance of years into no equal

things then must be explained by a long succession of 
inquiries we have but just begun to know how 
arise the morning and evening apearance the sta

fixed stars which put themselves in our way — which 
appearing perpetually in another and another place

demonstrate in what region the comets wander why 
they move so far asunder from the rest of what size 
and nature they are let us be content witli wliat we

us not wonder tliat what lies so deep is brought out 
so slowly how many animals have become known 
for the first time iu this age and the members of 
future generations shall know many of which we are 
ignorant many things are reserved for ages to come

some things that which comes after us others”

the komans 

while we admire the happy coincidence of these 
conjectures with the soundest views which the history 
of science teaches us we must not forget that they 
are merely conjectures suggested by very vague im 
pressions and associated with very scanty conceptions 
of the laws of nature seneca’s naiural questionsy 
from which the above extract is talflen contains a series 
of dissertations on various subjects of natural philo 
sophy as meteors rainbows lightnings springs 
rivers snow hail rain wind earthquakes and 
comets in the whole of these dissertations the 
statements are loose and the explanations of little or 
no value perhaps it may be worth our while to 
notice a case in which he refers to an observation of 
his own although his conclusion froloi it be enoneous 
he is arguing® against the opinion that springs arise 
from the water which falls in rain ‘‘in the first 
place” he says “ i a very diligent digger in my vine 
yard affinu that no rain is so heavy as to moisten the 
earth to the deptli of more than ten feet all the 
moisture is consumed in this outer crust and descends 
not to the lower part” we have here something of 
the nature of an experiment and indeed as we may 
rojidily conceive the instinct which impels man to 
seek truth by cxieriment can never be altogether ex 
tinguished seneca’s experiment was deprived of its 
value by the indistinctness of ids ideas which led him 
to rest in the crude conception of the water being 
“ consumed ” in the superficial crust of the earth 

it is unnecessary to pursue further the reasonings 
of the romans on such subjects and we now proceed 
to the ages which succeeded the fall of their empire

chapter viil 


abaiak philosophers 


i have noticed certain additions to physical science 
made by tlie arabians namely in astronomy 
the discovery of the motion of the sun’s apogee by 
albategnius and the discovery of the moon’s vartacti 
by aboulwefa ad in optics the assertion of alhazen 
that the angle of reflection is not proportional to the 
angle of incidence as ptolemy had supposed and cer 
tain steps in the philosophy of vision we must also 
suppose as the arabic word alkali reminds us that 
the arabians contributed to lay the foundations of che 
mistry the question which we have here to ask is 
whether the arabians made any steps beyond their 
predecessors in the philosophy of discovery and to 
this question conceive the answer must be this 
that among them as among the greeks those who 
practically observed nature and especially those who 
made discoveries in science must have hatl a practical 
acquaintance with some of the maxims which are 
ezemplifiod in the formation of science to discover 
that the apogee of the sun was degrees distant 
from the point where ptolemy had placed it alba 
tegnius ine careful observations and referred them 
to the theory of the eccentric so as to verify or correct 
that theory and when in the eleventh century 
arzachcl ibund the apogee to be less advanced than 
albategnius had found it he proceeded again to cor 
rect the theory by introducing a new movement of the 
equinoctial points which waa called the trepidalwih 


 ma ind sc b ul c iv feet 





arabian philosophers 

it appeared afterwards however that in doing this 
he had had too much confidence in the observations of 
his predecessors and that no such movement as the 
trepidation really existed in like manner to correct 
ptolemy’s law of refraction alhazen had recourse to 
experiment but ho did not put his experiments in 
the form of a table as ptolemy had done if he 
had done this he might possibly have discovered the 
law of sines which snell afterwards discovered 

but though the arabian philosophers thus in some 
cases observed facts and referred yiose facts to 
general mathematical laws it does not appear that 
they were led to put in any new or striking geneial 
form such maxims as this that the progress of sci 
ence consists in the exact observation of facts and in 
colligating them by ideas those of them who were 
dissatisfied with the existing philosophy as barren and 
useless for instance algazep were led to point at 
the faults and contradictions of that philosophy but 
did not attempt so far as i know to substitute for it 
anything better if they rejected aristotle’s organon 
they did not attempt to construct a new organon for 
themselves 

indeed they do not appear even to have had suffi 
cient confidence in the r truth of the astronomical 
theories which they had adojited from tlie greeks 
always to correct and extend those where their obser 
vations showed that they iequired correction and ex 
tension sometimes they did this but not generally 
enough when arzachel found by obseivation the 
apogee of the sun to be situated too far back he ven 
tured to correct ptolemy’s statement of its motion 
but when aboulwefa had really discovered the vari 
ation of the moon’s motion he did not express it 
by means of an epicycle if ho had done so he would 
have made it unnecessaiy for tyebo bnihe at a later 
period to make the same discovery

the moral of this incident is the same moral which we 
have perpetually to note as taught us at every step by 
the histoiy of science — namely the necessity of con

advantage of devising a theory even if it have to be

the schoolmen of the middle ages 


i n the history of the scietices have devoted a book 
to the state of science in the middle ages and have 
endeavoured to analyse the intellectual defects of that 
period among the characteristic features of the hu 
man mind during those times have noticed indis 
tinctness of ideas a comnientatorial spirit mysticism 
and dogmatism the account there given of this 
poiiion of the history of man belongs in reality 
rather to the history of ideas than to the history of 
progressive science for as we have there remarked 
theoretical science was during the period of which we 
speak almost entirely stationaiy and the investiga 
tion of the causes of such a state of things may be 
considered as a part of that review in which we are 
now engaged of the vicissitudes of man’s acquaintance 
with the methods of discovery but when wc offered 
to the world a history of science to leave so large a 
chasm unexplained would have made the series of 
events seem defective and broken and the survey of 
the middle ages was therefore inserted would beg 
to refer to that portion of the former work the reader 
who wishes for information in addition to what is here 
given 

the indistinctness of ideas and the commenta 
torial disposition of those ages have already been here 
brought under our notice tiewed with reference to 
the opposition between experience and ideas on 
which point as we have said the succession of opinions 
in a gxt measure turns it is clear that the commdn 
tatoii method belongs to the ideal side of the ques 
tion for the commentator seeks for such knowledge 



 philosophy op discovert 

as he values by analysing and iuastmting wliat his 
author has said and contout with this xnatetial of 
speculation does not desire to adl to it new stores of 
experience and observation and with i’cgard to the 
two other features in thecharacter which we gave to 
those ages we may observe that dogmatism demands 
for philosopliical theories the submission of mind due 
to those revealed religious doctrines which arc to guide 
our conduct and direct our hopes while mysticism 
elevates ideas into realities and offers them to us as 
the objects f cur religious regard tims the mysti 
cism of the middle ages anti their dogmatism alike 
arose from not discriminating the offices of theoretical 
and practical pliilostphy mxticism claimed for ideas 
the dignity and reality of principles of moral action 
and religious hope dogmatism imposed theoretical 
opinions respecting speculative points with the impe 
irative lone of rules of conduct and faith 

if however the opposite claims of theoiy and prac 
tice interfered with the progress of science by the con 
fusion they thus occasiouel they did so far more 
by drawing men away altogether from mere physical 
speculations the clirisian religion with its pre 
cepts its holies and its promises became the leading 
subject of men’s thoughts and the great active truths 
thus revealed and the duties thus enjoined made all 
inquiries of mere curiosity appear frivolous and un 
worthy of man the fathers of the church some 
times philosophized ill but far more commonly they 
were too intent upon the great lessons which they had 
to teach respecting man’s situation in the eyes of his 
heavenly master to philosophize at all respecting 
things remqte from the business of life and of no im 
portwee in man’s spiiitual concerns 

yet man has his intellectual as well as his spiritual 
wants he has faculties which demand systems and 
reasons as well as precepts and pramises the oirist 
um doctor who knew so much more than the heathen 
pnilosopher respiting the creator and governor of the 
aniterae was not long content to know or to teach less 
respecting the unirerse itel£ while it was still main 



schoolmen the middle ages 

tainod that theology was the only really important 
study theology was so extended and so fashioned as 
to include all other knowledge and after no long 
time the fathers of the church themselves became 
the authors of systems of utiivorsal knowledge 

but when this happened the commentatorial spirit 
was still in its full vigour the leaimed christians 
could not any more than the later greeks or the 
homans devise by the mere force of their own inven 
tion new systems full comprehensive and connected 
like those of the heroic age of®ihilosophy the same 
mental tendencies which led men to jook for secula 
tivc coherence and completeness in the view of the 
universe led them also to admire nd dwell upon the 
splendid and acute sjkjculations of the greeks they 
weio content to find in those immortal works the 
answers to the questions which their curiosity prompt 
ed and to seek what further satisfaction they might 
require in analysing and unfolding the doctrines pro 
mulgated by those great masters of knowledge thus 
the christian doctoiis became as to general philosophy 
commentotois upon tlie ancient greek teachers 

among these they selected aristotle as their pecu 
liar object of admiration and study the vast store 
both of opinions and facts whicli his works contain 
his acute distinctions his cogent reasons in some por 
tions of his speculations his mmetrical systems in 
almost all naturally commended him to the minds of 
subtle and curious men wc may add that plato 
who taught men to contemplate ideas septimto from 
things was not so well fitted for general acceptance 
as aristotle who rejected this separation for al 
though the due apprehension of this opposition of ldeas 
and sensations is a necessary step in the progress of 
true philosophy it requires a dearer view and a more 
balanced mind than the common herd of students 
possess and aristotle who evaded the necessary per 
plexities in which this antithesis involves us appeared 
to the temper of those times the easier and the 
pldner guide of the two 

the doctors of the middle ages having thus adopted 



 philosopht op msooveey 

aristotle as their master in philosophy we shiijl not be 
surprised to find thorn declaring after him thiit ex 
periencc is the source of our knowledge of the visible 
world but though like the gioeks they thus talked 
of exciment like the greeks th wowed little 
disposition to discover the laws of nature by observa 
tion of facts this barren and formal recognition of 
expcrioikio or sensation as one source of knowledge 
not being illustrated by a practical study of nature 
and by real theoretical trutlis obtained by such a 
study remained over vague wavering and empty 
such a mere acknowledgment cannot in any times 
ancient or modem be considered as indicating a just 
apprehension of the true basis anl nature of science 

in imperfectly peiueiving how and how far expe 
rience is the aoiuce of our knowledge of the external 
world the teachois of the middle ages were in the 
dark but so on this subject have been almost all tlic 
writers of all ages with the exception of thejse who 
in recent times have had their minds eulighteneil by 
contemiilating pliilosophically the modern progress of 
science the opinions of the doctors of the middle 
ages on such subjects generally bad those of aristtc 
for their basis but the subje was often still further 
analysed and systematised with an licute and metho 
dical skin hardly inferior to that of aristotle himselc 

the stagiritc in the beginning of his physics had 
made the following remarl in all bodies of doc 
trine which involve principles causes or elements 
bcionce and knowledge arise from the knowledge 
of these for we then consider ourselves to kiww 
respecting any subject when we know its first caus 
its first principles its ultimate elements it is evi 
dent therdbre that in seeking a knowledge of 
nature we moat first know what are its principles 
but the course of our knowledge from e tmngs 
which are better known and more manifest to ui io 
the things whiofa are more certain and evident in 
nature for those things which are most evident in 
truth are not most evident to m and consequently 
we must advance from things obscure in nature but 



sohcklimsn of thb viddle aobs 

to towwds tlio things which are really ia 
nature more clear and certain the things which 
are first obvious and apparent to ns are comx and 
finm these we obtain by analysis principles and ele 
ments we must pinceed from universals to particu 
lars for the whole is letter known to our senjses 
than the parts and for the same reason the universal 
better known than the rtidular nd thus words 
signify things in a large and iudiscriminate way 
which afterwards analysed by definition as we see 
that the ciijdicn at fiist call all men and all 

women moikery but afterwards icam to distinguish 
there are various assortions contained in this ex 
tract wbicli came to be considered aa standard maxims 
and which occur constantly in the writers of the mid 
dle ages such are for instance the maxim “ ver 
scire eat per oansas scire the reinaik that ooin 
poimds are known to us before their parts and the 
illustration from the expressions used by childieil 
of the mode in which this subject was treated by the 
schoobnen we may judge by looking at passages of 
thomas aquinas which treat of the subjeset of the 
human understanding in the sumnia tjieologiop the 
eightyfifth question is on the maimer and order of 
vndetbtanding whidi subject he considers in eight 
articles and these must even now be looked upon 
as cxhilntiug many of the moat important and iuteiv 
eating points of the eaibject they are firely whether 
our understanding understands by abstracting ideas 
apedes from appearances second whether intelli 
ble sjcies abstracted from appeaiances are related 
to our understanding as that whkji we understand or 
that y which we understand thirds whether our 
understanding does naturally imderstand universals

better than another ftgmhy whether bur under 
standing understands the indivisible sooner than the

divisibla and in the discnshion of the last pointy for 
example reference is made to the passage of aristotle 
which we have already quoted it may seem he 
says “ that we understand the indivisible before the 
divisible for tlm pkilosopjiet says that wo mnierstand 
and know by knowing principles and elements but 
indivisibles arc the principles and elements of divisible 
things but to this we may reply that in oiu receiving 
of science principles and elements are not always 
first for sometimes from the sensible effects we go on 
to the knowledge of itflielligible principles and causes” 
we see that both the objection and the answer are 
drawn from aristotle 

we find the siinie close imitation of aristotle in 
albertus magnus who like aquinas flourishcjd in the 
thirteenth century albertus indeed wrote tretaiises 
coiresponding to almost all those of the stagirite and 
was called the ape of aristotle in the beginning of 
his phfsiesy he says “ knowledge does nut always 
begin from that which is first according to the nature 
of things but from that of which the knowledge is 
easiest for the human intellect on account of its 
i’elation to the senses propter rxionem qiam habet 
ad semum collects science from the senses and thus 
it is easier for oui knowledge to begin from that which 
we can apprehend by sense imaginatipn and intellect 
than frcm tliat which we appreheml by intellect alone” 
we see that he has somewhat systematized what he 
has wtowed 

this disposition to dwell upon and systematize the 
icarling doctrines of metaphysics assumed a more defi 
nite and permanent sliape in the opositiou of the 
kealists and sfominalists the oposition involved in 
this controversy is in fact that fundamental antithesis 
of sense and ideas about whidi phupsoidiy has always 
been engaged and of which we have marked the 
manifestation in plato and aristotle the question 
what is the object of our thoughts when we reason 
eoheerning the eternal worldf must occur to all 
speculative minds and the difficulties of the answer 
iire manifest we must reply either that our owip 



schoolmen of the middle ages 


idebf or that sensible tilings are the elements of 
our knowledge of nature and then the acruplch 
again occur — how we have any general knowledge if 
our thoughts are fixeil on particular objects and on 
the other hand — how vre can attain to any true know 
ledge of nuture by contemplating ideas which arc not 
identical witli objects in nature the two opoite 
opinions maintained on this aubj‘ct were on the one 
side — that our general propositions refer to objects 
which are rcaly though divested of the peculiarities of 
individuals and ou the othf ridcrthat in such 
propositions individuals are not represented by any 
reality but bound ttigetlier by a name these two 
views wore held by the ilsiusta anl nominalists re 
spectively and thus the jlealist manifested the adhe 
rence to ideas and the nominalist the adherence to 
the impressions of sense which have always existed 
as opposite yet crrelafive bmdencies in mam 

the kealists wero the prevailing sect in the scho 
histic tirrus for example both thomas aquinas and 
duns scotus the angelical anti tlie subtle doctor 
held this tpiiiion although oposed to each oilier in 
iuany of their leading dtctrine on other subjects 
and as the nominalist fixing his atttmtion upon sen 
sible objects is obliged to consider what is the princi 
pie of gencralizafiou in order that the possibility of 
any general jiroposition may be conceivable so on the 
other hand the bealist banning with the contem 
plation of universal ideas is compelled to ask what is 
the prineiple of iudivldiialiony in order that he may 
comprehend the application of genoml propositions in 
each particular instance this inquiry concerning the 
principle of individuation was accordingly a problem 
which occupied all the leading minds among the 
schoolmen it will be ajqiarent from what has been 
said that it is only one of the many forms of the 
 ftmdamental antithesis of the ideas and the senses

the recoguitiou of the derivation of our knowledge 
in part at least from experience though always loose 
and incomplete appeals often to be independent of the 
peripatetic trailitioiis thus richtutl of st victor 
a writer of coiitemuitive theology in the twelfth cen 
tury says that “there are three sources of know 
ledge experience reason faiui some things we prove 
by experiment others we collect by reasoning the 
ceitainty of others avo hold by believing and with 
regald to tcnipoml mattois we obtain our knowledge 
by actual exikirieiicc the other guides belong to

of human knowdedgo which is clearly not derived 
directly from the ancients and which shows tliat con 
siderable attention must have been paid to such siecw 
lations ife legius by laying down clearly and broadly 
the distinction which as we have seen is of primary 
impoitatice between practice and theory practwe ho 
says includes seven mechanical arts those of the

relations of things which aie the subject of mathema 
tics again physics discovers causes from their effects 
and effects fwm thoir causes it would not be easy 
nt the present day to give a better account of the ob 
ject of physical science but richard of st victor 
makes this account still more romarkitbly judicious 
by the examples to which ho alludes which are 
earthquakes tiie tides the vihues of plants tlie in 
stincts of animals the classification of minerals plants 
and reptiles

he further adds physical science ascends from 
ofiects to causes and dascends again from causes to 
effects’ this declaration francis baam himself 
might have ailoptedl it is true tliat bichard would 
probably liave lieeii little able to produce any clr 
and dchnite iiistances of knowledge in which this 
ascent and descent wei’e exeinilified but still the 
statement even considered as a meie conjectural 
thought contains a portion of that sagacity and com 
prehensive power which we adryiiro so much in bacon 

bichard of st victor who lived in the twelfth 
century thus exhibits more vigour and indeiondeuce 
of speculative power than thomas aquinas albertus 
magnus and duns scotus in the thirteenth in the 
iuteiwal about the end of the twelfth century the 
writings of arisbjtle had become generally known in 
the west and had been elevated into the stmidard of 
philosophical doctrine by the divines mentioned abtve 
who felt a reverent symjiathy with the systematizing 
and subtle spirit of the suigirite as soon as it was 
made manifest to them these doctois following the 
exam e of their greiit forerunner reduced every art 
of human knowledge to a systematic form the sys 
tems which tliey thus framed wore resonted to mens 
minds as the only true philosophy and dissent from 
them was longer considered to be blameless it was 
an offence ogaiust religion as well as reason to reject 
the truth and the tnith could le but one in this 
manner arose that claim which the doctors of the 
church put forth to control mens opinions upon all 
subjects and which we have spoken of in the ilistory 
of science as the dogmatism of the iiddle ages 
there is uo difficulty in giving examples of this cha 
racteristic we may take for instance a statute of 
the university of paris occasioned by a bull of pope 
john xxi in which it is enacted that no master 
 or bachelor of any faculty shall presume to read lec 
tures upon any author in a private room on account 
of the many ierils which may arise therefrom but 


 v aaltalctll

shall read iu public jdaccs where all may resort and 
may faithfully report what is there taught excepting 
only books of grammar tind logic in which there can 
be no presumption and certain errors of bresciaii 
are condemned in a rescript of the papal legate 
odo with the following expressions “ whoixms as 
we have been informed certain logical professors 
treating of theology in their disputations and theo 
logians treating of logic contmry to the command of 
the law are not afraid to mix and confound the lots 
of the lords heritage we exliort and admonish your 
university all and singular that they be content with 
the landmaiks of the sciences and faculties which 
our fathers have fixed and that liaving due fear of 
the curse pronounced in the law against him who 
removeih his neighbour’s landmark you hold such 
sober wdadoni according to the apostles that yo may 
by no means incur the blame of innovation or pre 
sumption 

the account which in the hidory of scimcey i gave 
of dogmatism as a cliarocteristic of the middle ages 
has been indignantly rejected by a very pleasing 
niodehi writer who has wdth great feeling and great 
diligence brought into view the merits and beauties 
of those times termed by him ages of faith he 
urges that religious authority was never claimed for 
physical science and he quotes from thomas aquinas 
a jiassage in which the author piotcsts against the 
practice of conibunding opinions of philosophy with 
dictrines of faith we might quote in return the ke 
script of stephtm bishoji of paris in which he declares 
that there can be but one truth and rejects the dis 
tinction of things being true according to philosophy 
and not according to the catholic faith and it might 
be added that among the errors condemned in this 
document are some of thomas aquinas himself we 
might farther oliserve that if no physical doctriuea

were condemued m the times of which we now speak 
this as because on such subjects no new opinions 
were promulgated and not because opiniem was free 
as soon as new opinions even on physical subjects 
attracted general notice they wore prohibited by 
authority as we see in the cose of galileo’ 

but this disinclination tj recognize philosophy as 
indeptmdent of religion and this disposition to find in 
new theories even in physical ones something contiary 
to religion or scripture are itwoild seem very ba

to assert tjiat these jjropensities were conied to the 
periods when tlie authority of papal borne was highest 
or that the spirit wliicli has in a gieat degree con 
trolled and removed such habits was intrcwluced by 
the beformation of religion in the sixteenth centuiy 
we must trace to other causes the clear and geiier 
recognition of philasophy as distimit from theology 
and inleenlent of her authority in the eaiiior ages 
of the church indeed this separation bad leeu ac 
knowledged st augustin says “ a christian should 
beware how he speaks on questions of natural philo

tiously declared such to be the source of their know

the innovators op the middle ages 


 rayffiond luuy 

i general remarks — in the rise of experimental 
philosophy nuderstanding the term in the way just 
now stated two features have already been alluded to 
the disposition to caat off the prevalent rcveiece for 
the opinions and methods of preceding teachoi’s with 
an eager expectation of tome vast advantage u be de 
rived from a change and the belief that tliis improve 
ment must be sought by drawing our knowlelge from 
exteinol observation rather than from mere intellectual 
efforts — the insurrection against authority and the 
appeal to experience these two moveinciits were 
closely connected but they may easily be distinguished 
and in fact persons were very prominent in the fomior 
part of the lk who had no comprehension of the lat 
ter principle from which alone the change derives its 
valua there were many malcontents who had not 
the temper talent dr knowledge which fitted them to 
he reformcars 

 the authority which was questioned in the struggle 
of which we speak was that of the bcholaatic system 
the combination of philosophy with theology of which 
aristotl presented in the form and maimer which the 
doctors of the church had imposed upon him is to be 
considered the representative whop there was do 
nmnded of men a submission of the imnd such as this 
system claimed the natural love of freedom in mans 
bosojn and the speculative tendencies of hia intellect 
rose in rebellion from time to ttme sinst the ruling 
oppression we find in allperioda of the scholimtic 
 ages examples of this disposition of man to resist over

ever combined with a want jof solid thought and 
showing itsidf in extravagant pretensions and fiintasti 
cal systems put forwards by the insurgents we have 
poiiitchl out one such opponent of tlie established sys

i raymonrl luuy — eaymond lully is perhaps 
traditionally best known sis an alchemist of which 
art he apiears to have been a cultivator but this 
was only one of the many impulses of a sjirit ardently 
thirsty of knowledge and novelty he had in his 
youth been a man of pleasure but was driven by a 
sudden shook of feeling to resolve on a comph change 
of life he plunged into solitude endeavoured to still 
the remorse of his conscience by prayer and penance 
and soon had his soul ponsessed by visions which ho 
conceived were vouchsafed to him in the feeling of 
religious enthusiasm thus excited he resolved to de 
vote his life to the diffusion of christian truth among 
heathens and mahoiuedana for this piirose at the 
ago of thirty he betook liimsolf to the study of gram 
mar and of thf arabic language he breathcnl earnest 
supplications for an illumination from above and these 
were answered by his receiving from heaven as his 
admiiers declare his ats mayna by which he was able 
witliout labour or effort to learn and apply all ktiow 
ledge the real state of the case is that he put him 
self in opposition to the tahlished systems and pro 
pounded a new art from which ho promised the most 
wonderful results but that his art really is merely 
mode of combining ideal conceptions without any re 
ference to real sources of knowlge or any possibility

obtain the means of talking and writing upon all sub

it in a thousand ways and followed it into a variety 
of developments bjisides synojtical tables he em 
ploys genealogical trees each of wliich ho dignifies 
with the name of the tree of science the only rihjui 
site for the application of his system was a certain 
agreement in the numbers of the classes into which 
diflbrent subjects were distiibiitcd and as this sym 
metry does not really exist in the operations of our 
thoughts some violence was done to the natural dis 
tinction and subordination of conceptions in order to 
fit them for the use of the system 

thus lully while he professed to teach an art 
which was to shed new light upon every part of 
science was in fact employed in a pedantic and trifling 
repetition of known truths or truisms and while he 
comlaned of the eitois of existing methods ho pro 
posed in their place one which was far more empty 
barren and worthless than the customy processes of 
human thought yet his method is spoken of with

roger bacon was born in r r near ilchoster in 
somersetshire of an old family in lus youth he was 
a student at oxford and made extraordinary progress 
in all bmnches of learning he then went to the 
xjnivorsity of paris as was afc that time tlie custom 
of learned englishmen and there reccivwl the degixie 
of doctor of theology at the persuasion of robert 
grostete bishop of lincoln he entered the brother 
hood of franciscans in oxford and gae himself up to

his brother monks doctor mirabilis we knitw from 
his own works as well as from the traditions concern

with all the science of his time which could be ac 
quired from books and that he had made many re 
markable advances by means of his own experimental 
labours he was acquainted with arabic as wu as

sevcxnl of the most remaikable iiiventioiis which were 
made generally known soon afterwartla as gunpow 
der louses burning specula tidesoopes clocks the 
correction of the calemuir and the explanation of the

thus osscssing in the acquirements and habits of 
his owu mind abundant examples of the nature of 
knowledge and of the piocess of invention roger 
llacon felt alsq a deep interest in the growth and pro 
gress of science a spirit of inquiry respecting the 
causes which protluced or prevented its advaiict and 
a fervent hoje and trust in its future destinies and 
these feelings impelled him to speculate worthily and 
wisely respecting a reform of the method of philoso 
phizitig the manuscrits of his works have existed 
for nearly six hundred years in many of the libraries 
of europe and esjwjcially in those of england and 
for a long ierioil the very imperfect portions of them 
which were generally known left the character and 
attainments of the author shrouded in a kind of mys 
terious oliscurity aboit a century ago however his 
was published by dr s jebb princi 
jmilly from a manuscript in the library of trinity 
college dublin and this contained most or all of the 
separate works which were previously known tj the 
public along with others still more peculiar and cha 
racteristic wo are thus able to judge of roger 
bacon’s knowledge ontl of his views and they are in 
every way well worthy our attention

fourth whom bacon htul known who he was legate

admired the talents of the monk and pitied him for

if the work had had no leading purpose it would have 
lieen highly valuable as a treasure of the most solid 
knowledge and soundest sjieculations of the time even 
if it had contained no such details it would have been 
a work most remarkable for its general views and

vour to point out more especially the way in which 
the various principles which the reform of scientific 
method involved are here brought into view 

one of the first joints to be noticed for this pur 
pose is the resistance to authority and at the stage 
of xihilosophical histoiy with which wc hero have to 
do this means resistance to the authority of aristotle 
as adoited and intei reted by the doctors of the 
schools bacon’s work is divided into six parts and 
of these pars the sii’st is of the four universal 
causes of all human ignomnce the causes thus 
enumerated’ are — the force of unworthy authority 
— traditionary habit — the imperfection of the undis 
ciplined senses— and the disjksition to conceal our 
ignorance and to make an ostentatious show of our 
knowledge these influences involve eveiy man oc 
cupy every condition they prevent our obtaining 
the most usefiil and large and fsiir lotrinc of wisdom 
the secret of all sciences and arts ho thtn proceeds 
to argue from the testimony of philosophcis them 
selves that the authority of antiquity and especially 
of aristotle is not infallible “ we find their books 
full of doubts obscurities and peqdekities they

when avicenna and averroes and others recalled 
this philosophy into the full light of exposition and 
although the logic and some otlier works were trans 
lated by boethius from the greek yet the philosiv 
phy of amtotle fiist received a quick increase among 
the latins at the time of michael scot who in the 
year of our lord appeared bringing with him 
ortions of the books of aristotle on natural philo 
sophy and mathematics and yet a small part only 
of the works of this uthor is translated and a still 
smaller part l in the hands of common htudents” 
ho adds further® in the third part of the opn 
which is a dissertation on language that the 
translations which are current of these writings aro 
very bad and imperfect with these vievs ho is 
moved to express himself somewhat impatiently re 
specting these works “ if i had” he says “ jxwer 
over the works of aristotle i vrould have them all

and a cause of error and a multiplication of ignorance 
beyond expression” the common herd of students” 
he says “with their heab have no principle by wdiich 
they can be excited to any worthy employment and 
hence they mope and make asses of themselves over 
their bad translations and lose their time and trouble 
and money” 

the remedies which he recommends for these evils 
are in the first place the study of that only perfect 
wisflom which is to he found in the sacred scripture 
in the next place the study of mathematics and the 
use of experiment by the aid of these methods

bacon anticipates the most spieiiiud progress for human 
kuowlcdgei he takes tip stiain of hope and 
conmence which we luave noticed as so peculiar in 
the roman writci and quotes some of tlie lassages 
of seneca which we adduced in illustration of this — 
that the attempts in science were at first mde and 
imperfect and wcie afterwards inqiroved — that the 
clay will come wdicm what is still unknown shall be 
brought to light by the progress of time and the 
labours of a longer jhtriod — that one ago docs not 
suffice for inquiries so wide aifd variens — that the 
eople of iiiture times shall knrw many things un 
known to us — and that the timcsliall arrive when 
posterity will wonder tliat we ovcrloiked what was so 
obvious bacon himself adds anticipations more pecu 
liarly in the sjjirit of his owm time “ v e have seen” 
he says at the end of the work “how aristotle by 
the ways which wisdom teaches cxuld give to alex 
ander tlie empire of the world and this thti church 
ought to take into consideration against the infidels 
and rebels that there may lc a sparing of christian 
blood and especially on account of the troubles that 
shall come tv pass in the days of antichrist which 
by the grace of gd it would be easy to obviate if 
relates and princes would cncoiu’age study and join 
in searching out the secrets of nature and art” 

it may not be iiupniper to observe liere that this 
indief in the appointed progress of knowledge is not 
combined with any overweening belief in the un 
louuded and imlependent power of the human intellect 
in the contrary one of the lessons which bacon dmws 
from the state and prospects of knowledge is the duty 
of faiih and humility “to him” he stiys “who 
denies the truth of the faith liecause he is unable to 
undeistand it i will propose in redy the course of 
nature and as we have seen it in examples” and 
after giving some instances he adds “ these and the 
like ought to move men and to excite them to tie 
reception of divine truths for if in the vilest objects

of creation truths are found boibre which the inward 
pride of man must bow and believe though it cannot 
understand how much more should man humble his 
mind before the glorious truths of god” ho had 
before saidt “man is iiicaablo of perfect wisdom in 
this life it is hard for him to ascend towards perfec 
tion easy to glide downwards to falsehoods and vani 
ties let him then not boast of his wisdom or extol 
his knowledge what he knows is little and worth 
less in respect of that which he believes without know 
ing and stilhleas in respect of that which he is igno 
rant of he is mad who thinks highly of his wisdom 
he most mad who exhibits it as something ti be won 
dered at” he adds as another reason for humility 
that he has proved by trial he could tach in one year 
to a poor boy the marrow of all that the most diligent 
peison could acquire in forty years laborious and ex 
pensive study 

to proceed somewhat more in detiiil with regard to 
roger bacon s views of a refonn in scientific inuiry 
we may obseiwe tliat by making mathematics and ex 
periment the two great points of his recommendation 
he directed his iinrovernent to the two essential parts 
of all knowledge ideas and facts and thus took the 
course which the most enlightenfnl philosophy would 
have suggested he did not urge the prosecution of 
cxicriment to the comparative neglecjt of the existing 
niatliematiea sciences and conception a fault which 
there is some ground for ascribing to his gixat name 
sake and succssor francis bacon still less did he 
cnteiit himself with a mere protest against the au 
thority of the schools and a vague demand for change 
which was almost all that was done by those who put 
themselves forward as refonnors in the intermediate 
time rcer bacon holds his way steadily betweek 
the two poles of human knowledge which as we have 
seen it is far from eaty to do “ there are two modes 
otknowing” says he‘ “hy argument and by experi

ment argument concludes a question but it docs 
not make us feel certain or aocuiesce in the contem 
plation of truth except the truth be also found to be 
so by experience” it is not easy to express more 
decidedly the clearly seen union of exact conceptions 
with certain facts which as we have explained consti

tablish this loctnno show a most just appreciation of 
the otiice of niuthematics in science they are such as 
follows — that otlujr sciences use examples taken from 
inatlieniaiics as th‘ most evident — that mathematical 
knowledge is as it were innate in us ou which point 
he refers to the avellknowii dialogue of plato as 
quoted by cicero — that this science being the easi 
est the best intitiduotioii to the more dilficult 

— that in inatheniutics things as knowm to us are 
identical with things as known to natuio — that we 
can here entirely avoid doubt and error and obtiuu

intdlectmy “ moreover” he adds” “ there have been 
fouml famous men us robert bishop of lincoln and

others who by the power of mathematics liave been 
able to explain the causes of things as may be seen

blit undkubtedly the mast remarkable portion ot the 
ma is the sixth and last bart which is en 
titled be smentia experimental” it is indeed an 
extraordinary circumstance to find a iviiter of the 
ihirteentii century not only recogniziug experiment 
as one source of knowledge but urging its claims as 
something far more impoiiiant than men had yet heeni 
aware of exemplifying its value by striking and just 
examples and speaking of its authority with a dignity 
of diction which sounds like a foreinurmur of the ba 
conian senteijea uttered nearly four hundred years 
later yet this is the character of what we here end® 
“experimental science the sole mistress of speculative 
sciences has three great prerogatives among other 
parts of knowledge eirat she tests by expciimeut the 
noblest conclusions of all other sciences next she 
discovers respecting the notions which other sciences 
deal with inagniecent tiniths to which these sciences 
of themselves can by no means attain her third dig 
nity is that she by her own power and without resiect 
of other sciences investigates the secret of nature” 

the examples wliich bjujoh gives of these “prerogar 
tives” are very curious exliibiting among some error 
and credulity sound and clear views his leading 
example of the first prerogjitive is the rainbow of 
which the cause as given by aristotle is tested by 
reference to experiment with a skill which is even to 
us now truly aflmirablc tlie examples of uio second 
prerogative are three— the ait of making an 
artificial sphere which sliall move with tho heavens by 
natural iiifiuences which bacon trusts may be done 
though astronomy herself cannot do it — “ot tunc” he 
says “ thesauiiim unlus regis valeret hoc instruineui 
turn” — secotully the art of prolonging life which 
experiment may teach though medicine no means 
of uocuriug itexcet by regimen the art of

making gold finer tkan fine gold which goes bejoiui 
the power of alchemy the third prerogative of ex 
perimental science arts independent of the received 
sciences is exemiified iii many curious examples many 
of them whimsical traditions thus it is said twthe 
character of a people may be altered by altering the 
air® alexander it seems applied to aristotle to 
know wdietber he should exterminate certain nations 
which he had discovered as being irreclainiably bar 
barous to which the philosopher replied “ if you can 
alter their air permit them to live if iat put them to 
death in this part we find the suggestion that the 
fire works made by children of saltpetre might lead 
to the invention of a formidable military weapon 

it could not be expected that roger bacon at a 
time when exeriuignied science hardly existed could 
give any precepts for the discovery of truth by exfveri 
inent but nothing can be a better example of the 
method of such investigation tlian his inquiry con 
cerning the cause of the rainbow neither aristotle 
nor avicenna nor seneca he says have given us any 
lear knowledge of this matter but experimental 
science can do so let tlie exerimenter experiniettr 
tatcr consider the cases in which lie finds the same 
colours as the hexagonal crystsils from lieland and 
india by looking into these he will see colouis like 
those of the rainbow many think that this arises 
from some special virtue of these stones and their hex 
agonal figure let therefore the experimenter go on 
and he will find the same in other transiiarent stones 
ill dark ones as well as in lightcoloured he will find 
the same effect also in other forms than the hexagon

if they be furrowed in the surface as the irish ciys 
tala are let him consider too that he sees the same 
colours in the drops which are dashed from oars in 
the sunshine j — and in the spray thrown by a mill 
wheel — and in the dewdrops which lie on the grass 
in a inealow on a summermorning — and if a man

into a sunbeam — and if in an oillamp hanging in the

duced we have here a collection of instuicts which 
are almost all examples of the same kind as the phe

colours of the rainlow were afterwards really explainedr 

with regard to the foim and other circumstances of 
the bow he is still more precise he bils us mejisure 
the height of the bow and of the sun to show that the 
center of the bow is exactly opposite to the sun he 
explains the circular fonn of the bow — its being inde 
pendent of the fonn of the cloiid its moving when we 
move its flying when we follow — by its consisting of 
tlie reflections from a ‘ast number of minute drops 
he does not indeed trace the course of the rajs 
through the drop or account for the precise magni 
tude which the bow assumes but ho approaches tf 
the verge of this jmrt of the explanation and must be 
considered as having given a most hapiy example of 
experimental inquiry into nature at a time when such 
examples were exceedingly scanty in this respect 
he was more fortunate than francis bacon as wo shall 
hereafter see 

wo know but little of the biography of boger bacon 
but vre have every reason to believe that his influence 
upon his age was not great he was suspooted of 
magic and is said to have been put into close confine 
ment in consequence of this charge in his work he 
speaks of astrology as a science well worth cultivat 
ing but” says he tlieologians md deoretists 
not being learned in such matters and seeing that evil 
as well as good may be done neglect and abhor such

things and reckon them among magic arts” we 
liave already seen that at the very time when bacon 
was thus raising his voice against the habit of blindly 
following authority and seeking for all science in 
aristotle thomas aquinas was employed in fishion 
ing aristotle’s tenets into that fixed form in which 
they became the great impediment to the progress of 
knowichlge it would seem indeed that something 
of a struggle between tlie progressive and stationary 
powers of the liuman mind wa j going on at this time 
bacon himself says “never wa th§re so gieat an 
appearance of wisdom nor so nnicli exercise of study 
in so many faculties in so many regions as for this 
last foity years doctois are dispersetl eveiywhei’c in 
every castle in every burgh and especially by the stu 
dents of two orders ho means the franciscans and 
dominicans ¦who were almost tlic only religious orders 
that distinguished themselves by an application to 
study which has not hapihjued except for about 
forty years and yet there was never so much igno 
itiiice so much ciror” and in the part of his work 
which refers to mathematics he sjiys of that study 
that it is the door and the key of the sciences and 
that the neglect of it for thirty or forty years has en 
tirely mined the studies of the latins according to 
these statements some change disastrous to the for 
tunes of science mnst have token place about 
soon after the foundation of the dominican and fran 
ciscan oidci’s nor can we dchibt that the adoption 
of the aristotelian philosophy by these two orders 
in the form in which the angelical doctor had sys 
tematized it was one of the events which mast tended 
to defer for three centuries the reform which boger 
bacon urged as a matter of crying necessity in his 
own time

the revival of platonism 


i causes of ddayn the advance of knowledge— 
in the insight possessed by learned men into the 
method by which truth was to be disco veiled the four 
teenth and fifucuth centuries went backwards rather 
than forwards from the point which had been reached 
in the thirteenth roger bacon had urged them to 
have recoui’se to experiment but they returned with 
additional and exclusive zeal to the more favourite 
employment of reasoning upon their own conceptions 
he had called upon them to look at the world without 
but their eyes forthwith turned back upon the world 
within in the constant oscillation of the human 
mind between ideas and facts after having for a 
moment touched the latcer it seemed to swing back 
more impetuously to the former not only was the 
philosophy of aristotle firmly established for a con 
siderable period but when men began to question its 
authority they attempted to set up in its place a phi 
losophy still more puvely ideal that of plato it was 
not till the actual progress of exerimental knowledge 
for some centuries had given it a vast accumulation cdt 
force that it was able to break its way fully into the 
circle of speculative science the new platonist school 
men had to run tlicir course the practical discoverers 
hafl to pidve their merit by their works the italian 
innovators had to utter their aspirations for a change 
lefore the second bacon could truly declare that the 
tir for a fundamental reform was at length arrived 

it cannot but seem strange to any one who attempts 
to trace the general outline of tlie intellecttial progress 
of man and who considers him as under the gaiaattee

of a providential sway that he should thus be permit 
ted to wander so long in a wilderness of intellectual 
darkness and even to turn back by a perverse ca 
price as it might seem when on the veiy border of the 
brighter and better land which was his destined in 
heritance we do not attempt to solve this difficulty 
but such a course of things naturally suggests tlie 
thought that a progrtss in physical science is not the 
main object of man’s career in the eyes of the power 
who directs the foitunes of our race we can easily 
conceive that it may havo behn necessary to man’s 
general welfare tliat he should continue to turn his 
eyes inwards upon his own heart and faculties till

it appears jrolealo tmt neither poetry nor painting 
nor the other arts which require for their perfection a 
lofty and spiritualized imagination would have ap 
peared in tho nohle and beautiful forms which they 
assumed in the fmitcenth and fifteenth centuiy if 
men of genius had at the beginning of that period 
made it their main business to discover the laws of 
nature and to reduce them to a rigorous scientific 
form yet who can doubt that the absence of these 
touching and impressive works would have left one of 
the best and purest parts of man’s nature without its 
due nutriment and development it may perhaps 
be a necessary condition in the progress of man that 
the aits which aim at beauty shoidd reach their ex 
cellence before the sciences which seek speculative 
truth and if this be so we inherit from the middle 
ages treasures which may well reconcile us to the 
delay which took place in their cultivation of experi 
mental science 

however this may be it is our business at present 
to trace the circumstances of this very lingering ad 
vance we have already noticed tho contest of the 
nominalists and realists which was one form though 
with regard to scientific methods an unprofitable one 
of tlie antithesis of ideas and things lliough theie 
fore this struggle continued we need not dwell upon 
it the nominalists denied the real existence of ideas 
whch doctrine was to a great extent implied in the 
prevailing systems but the controversy in which they 
thus engaged did not lead them to seek for knowledge 
iu a new field and by new methods tho aigumentsj

which occam the nominalist opposes to those of duns 
scotus the kealist are marked with the stamp of the 
same system and consist only in permutations and 
combinations of tho same elementary conceptions it 
whs not till the impulse of external circumstances was 
added to the discontent whicli the more stining in 
tellects felt towards the barren dogmatism of their 
age that the activity of the luiman mind was again 
called into full play aad a new career of progression 
entered upon till then undreamt of except b a few 
prophetic spirits • 

 causes of frogress — these circumstances were 
principally the revival of greek and roman literature 
the invention of printing the protestant reformation 
and a great number of curious discoveries and inven 
tions in the arts whicli were soon succeeded by im 
portant steps in speculative physical science con 
nected with the first of these events was the rise of a 
party of learned men who exjamsed their dissatisfac 
tion with the ariatotehan philosophy fis it was then 
taught and manifested a strong preference for the 
views of plato it is by no means suitable to our plan 
to give a detailed account of this new platonic school 
but we may notice a few of the writers who belong to 
it so fiir at least as to indiciitc ks influence upon the 
methods of pursuing science 

in tho fourteenth centuiy the frequent intercourse 
of tho most cultivated persons of the eastern and 
western empire the increased study of the greek lan 
guage in italy tho intellectual activity of the italian 
states the ddscovery of manuscripts of the classical 
authors were circumstances which excited or nourished 
a new and zealous study of the works of greek and 
roman goniua the genuine writings of the ancients 
when presented in their native life and beauty instead 
of being seen only in those lifeless fragments and dull 
transformations which the scholastic system had ez 
 hibited excited an intense enthusiasm europe at 
tbiit period might be represented by plato’s beautiful

allegory of a man who after being long kept in a daiib 
oavem in which his knowledge of the external world 
is gathered from the images which stream through the 
chinks of his prison is at last led foith into the full 
blaze of day it was inevitable that such a change 
should animate men’s efforts and enlarge their facul 
ties greek literature became more and more known 
especially by the influence of learned men who came 
from constantinople into italy theiie teachers though 
they honoured aristotle reverenced plato no less and 
had never been accustdtned to follow with servile sub 
mission of thought cither these or any other leaders 
the effect of such influences soon reveals itself in the 
works of that period dante has woven into his jhvina 
commedia some of the ideas of platonism petrarch 
who had formed his mind by the study of cicero and 
had thus been inspired with a profound admiration for 
the literature of greece learnt greek from llarlaam 
a monk who came as ambassatlor from the emperor of 
the eixst to the pope in with this instructor 
the poet read the works of plato struck by their 
beauty he contributed by his writings and his con 
versation to awake in others an admiration and love 
for that philosopher which soon became strongly and 
extensively prevalent among the learned in italy 

 hertoolavs barharasy dec — along with the feel 
ing there prevailed also among thjse who had learnt 
to relish the genuine beauties of the greek and latin 
writers a strong disgust for the barbarisms in which 
the scholastic pmlosophy was clothed hermolaus bar 
barus® who was born in at venice and had 
formeci his taate by the study of classical literature 
translated among other learned works themistiiis’s 
paraphrastic cxjiositions of the physics of aristotle 
with the view of trying whether the aristotelian natu 
ral philosophy could not be presented in good latin 
which the scholastic teachers denied in his preface 
he expresses great indignation against those dliloso

subjects in barbarous latin and in an uncultured 
style so that all refined minds are repelled from these 
studies by weariness and disgust they have he says 
by this barbarism endeavoured to secure to themselves 
in their own province a supremacy without rivals or 
opponents hence they maintain that mathematics 
phiiosojihy juiisprudcnce cannot be expounded in cor 
rect ljitin — that between these sciences and the go 
imirie liatin language there is a great gulf as between 
tilings that cannot be brought together and on this 
ground they blame those who comviine the study of plii 
lology and eloquence with that of science this opinion 
adds llermolaus perverts and iniins our studies and is 
highly prejudicial and unworthy in respect to the state 
herniolaus awoke in others as for instance in john 
iicus of mirandnla the same dislike to the ieigning 
school philosophy as an opponent of the same kind 
wo may add marius nizolins of bersallo a scholar who 
carried his admiration of cicero to an exaggersitcd ex 
tent and who was led by a controversy witli the de 
fenders of the scholastic philasophy to jmblish 
a work on the trve principles and true method of 
philosophizing in the title of this work he professes 
to give “the true jrinciplcs of almost all arts and 
scicucs refuting and rejecting almost all the false 
principles of the logicians and metaphysicians” but 
although in the work he attacks the scholastic phi 
losophy he does little or nothing to justify the large 
pretensions of his title and he excitcd it is said little 
notice it is therefore curious that leibnitz should 
have thought it worth his while to roedit this work 
which he did in adding remarks of his own 

 nicolaus gvraamis — without dwelling upon 
this opposition to the scholastic system on the ground 
of taste i shall notice somewdiat further those writers 
who put forwards platonic views as fitted to complete 
 or to replace the doctrines of aristotle among these 
i my place nicolaus cusanus so called from ous a 
village on the moselle where he was bom in 
who was afterwowis raised to the dignity of cardinal 
we might indeed at iirst be tempted to include

cusonus among thoso prns who were led to rej 
the old philosophy by being themselves agents in iho 
progressive movement of physical science for he 
published before copoiiiicus and independently of 
him the doctrine that the earth is in motion but 
it should be recollected that in order to see the possi 
bility of this doctrine and its claims to acceptance 
no new reference to observation was recpiisite the 
heliocentric system was merely a new mode of repre 
senting to the mind facts with which all astronoinera 
had long been fain iliarv the system might very easily 
liavc been embraced and inculcated by plato himself 
as indeed it is said to have been actually taught by 
pythagonis the mere adoption of the heliocentric 
view therefore without attempting to realize the sys 
tem ill detail as copernicus did cannot entitle a 
writer of the fifteenth century to be hoked upon as 
one of the authors of the discoveries of that f period 
and we must consider cusanus as a speculative anti 
aristotelian rather than as a iracticiil reformer 

the title of cusanuss book db doetd ignorantid 
shows how far ho was fiom agreeing with thosti who 
conceived that in the works of aristotle they had 
a full and complete system of all human knowledge 
at the outset of this book® he says after pointing out 
some difficulties an the received philosophy “if there

totle in his first philosophy y affirms that in things 
most nmnifest by nature theie is a difficulty no less

fully attain to this wc shall arrive at instructed r

mortality of the soul the principles of goodness and 
beauty and other points of the same order the 
object of those and other platonists of this school 
however was not to expel the aiitliority of aristotle 
by that of plato many of them had come to the con 
viction that the highest ends of philosophy were to be 
 reached only by bringing into accordance the doctrines 
of plato and of aristotle of this opinion was john 
picus count of mirandula and concordia and under

this persuasion he employed the whole of his life in 
labounng upon a work de concordid platonia ti 
iotelis which was not completed at the time of his 
death in and has never been published but 
about a century later another writer of the same school 
francis patricius® pointing out the discrepancies be 
tween the two greek teachers urged the propriety of 
deposing aristotle from the supremacy he had so long 
enjoyed ‘‘now all these doctrines and others not 
a few” he says® “ since they are platonic doctrines 
philosophicallyiiiost true and consonant with the catho 
lic faith whilst the aristritelian tenets are contiury 
to the faith and philosophically false who will not 
both as a christian and a philosopher prefer plato to 
anstotle and why should not hereafter in all the 
colleges and monatenes of europe the reading and 
study of plato be introduced i why should not the 
jhilosophy of aristotle be forthwith exiled from such 
jilkces why must men continue to drink the mortal 
poison of impiety from that source” witli much more 
in the same strain 

the platonic school of which we have spoken had 
however reached its highest point of prosperity before 
this tijne and was already declining about igoo 
the platouists appeared to triumph over the peripar 
tetics® but the death of their great patron cardinal 
bessarion about this time and we may add the hol 
lowness of their system in many points and its want 
of lituess for the wants and expectations of the age 
turned men’s thoughts partly back to the established 
aristotelian doctrines and partly forwards to schemes 
of bolder and fresher promise

just spoken was one of those who had arrived at the 
conviction that the formation of a new philosophy

needed in appeared his nova dc universis

hardly fail to remind ns of the expressions which 
francis bacon soon afterwards used in the opening of 
a work of the same nature “ h’lancis patricius being 
about to found aiiew tlie true philosophy of the uni 
verse dared to begin by announcing the following 
iudisputuble princiiiles” heie however the resem

of experiments proves what indeed is evident from 
the general scheme of his system that he had no due 
appreciation of the place which observation must hold 
in real and natural philosophy

a writer of our own country belonging to this

his studies at oxford travelled for several years of

most learned and was engagel in various controver

he thus brings us in contact vrith the next class of 
pliilosopliers whom we have to consider the practical 
reformers of philosophy — those who furthei’ed the

the theouetical reformers op science 


w e have il ready seen that patricius about the 
middle of the sixteenth century announced his 
purpose of founding anew the whole fabric of philoso 
liy but that in tfixccuting this jdan he ran into wide 
and baseless hypotheses suggested by a priori concep 
tifjns rather than by external observation and that he 
was fuither misled by fanciful analogies resembling 
those which tlie platonic mystics loved to contemplate 
the same time and the period which followed it pro 
duced several other essfiys which were of the same 
nature with the exception of their being free from the 
peculiar tendencies of the platonic school and these 
insurrections against the authority of the established 
dogmas although they did not directly substitute a 
better positive system in the place of that which they 
assailed shook the authority of the anstotelian sys 
tem and led to its overthrow which took place as soon 
as these theoretical reformers mrere aided by practical 
iefbmiors 

i bernardinus tdedus — italy always in modem 
times fertile in the beginnings of new systems was 
the soil on which these innovators arose the earli 
est and most conspicuous of them is bernardinus 
telesiiis who was bom in at cosemsa in the 
kingdom of naples his studies carried on with 
great zeal and ability first at milan and then at 
rome made him well acquainted with the knowledge 
of jiis times but his own reflections convinced him 
that the basis of science as then received was alto 
gether erroneons and led him to attompt a reforip 
with which view in he published at romo

great progress and the knowledga wdiich he thus

aristotelian philosophy he undertook a closer ex 
auiiriation of the physical doctrines of anstotle and 
as the result of tliis he was astonished how it could 
have been possillc that so many excellent men so

he adds ‘not relying on ourselves and of a duller

the execution of the work however by no means 
corresponds to the announcement tlie doctiines of 
aristotle are indeed attacked and the objections to 
these and to other reived opinions form a large art 
of the work but these objections are supjkjrtod by 
a priori reasoning and not by experiments and tliuw

chanicter he assumes three principles hat cold

immobility and matter is tlie corporeal substratum in 
which these incorporeal and active principles produce 
their effects it is easy to imagine lltat by combining

and separating these abstractions in various ways a 
sort of account of many natural phenomena may be 
given but it is impossible to ascribe any real value to 
such a system the merit of tclerius must be con 
sidered to consist in his rejection of the aristotelian 
errors in his perception of the necessity of a reform in 
the method of philosophizing and in his persuasion that 
this reform must be founded on ox peri in cuts rather 
than on reasoning when he said “wo projxjso to 
ourselves to turn our eyes to the world itself and its 
parts their passions actions operations and species” 
liis view of the course to be followed was right but 
his purpose remained but ill fulfilled by the arbitrary 
edifice of abstract conceptions which his system ex

piancis bacon who alxmt half a century later 
treated the subject of a reform of pliilosohy in a hir 
more penetrating and masterly mnnner has given us 
his judgment of telesius in his view he bikes 
telesiiis as the restorer of the atomic philosophy 
which democritus and parinoniclea taught among the 
ancients and according to his custom he presents an 
image of this philosophy in an adaptation of a jiortion 
of ancient mythology the celestial cnjid mdio with 
cadus was the parent of the gods and of the uni 
verse is exhibited as a rejiresentation of matter and 
its properties according to the democritean philoso

well and acknowledge him as a lover of truth a use 
ful contributor to science an amendcr f some tenets 
the first of recent men but wq have to do with him 
as the restorer of the philosophy of parmenides to 
whom much reverence is due” witli regard to this 
philosophy he pronounces a judgment which very 
truly expresses the cause of its ntshnesa and empti 
ness “it is” he says “such a system as naturally

“ telesius although learned in the peripatetic philoso 
phy if that were anything which indeed he inis 
turned agiiinst tlie teachers of it is hindered by his 
affirmations and is more successful in destroying thau 
in building” 

the work of telesius excited no small notice and 
was placed in the index expurfja torim it made many 
disciples a censequeiice probably due to its spirit of 
systemmaking no less than to its promise of reform 
or its acuteness of argument for till trial and reflec

 thomas campanella — accordingly telesius 
may be looked upon as the founder of a school his 
most distinguished successor was thomas camjianella 
who was born in at stilo in calabria he showed 
great talents at an early age prosecuting his studies 
at cosenza the birthplace of the grcjit opponent of 
arlstotle and reformer of philosophy he too has 
given us an account® of the course of thought by which 
he was led to become an innovator “being afraid 
tliat not genuine truth but falsehood in the place of 
truth was tlie tenant of the peripatetic school i ex 
amined all the greek latin and arabic comment

delighted me ou account of his frcvtjdoiu in philoso 
phizing and because he rested upon the nature of 
ihings and not upon the jissortions of men” 

with these views and feelings it is not wonderful 
that campauella at the early age of twentytwo 
published a work remarkable for the bold promise of 
its title thomas camjjanellas philosophy demun

sense ef things and magic and in other literary 
labours these however are full of the indications of 
ail enthusiastic temper inclined to mystical devotion 
and of opinions bearing the cast of pantheism for 
instance the title of the book last quoted sets forth as 
demonstrated in the course of the work • that “the 
world is the living and intelligent statue of god and 
that all its parts and particles of parts are endowed some 
with a clearer sme with a more obscure sense such as 
suffices for the preservation of each and of the whole” 
besides these opinions which could not fail to make 
him obnoxious to the religious authorities campa

yeais and at last obtained his hbeiation by the intcr

in danger from the neapolitan inquisition and escaped 
in disguise to paris where he received a peiision from 
the king and lived in intercourse with the most emi

campanella was a contemporary of francis bacon 
whom we must consider as belonging to an epoch to 
which the calabrian school of innovators was only a 
prelude i shall not therefore further follow the con

theoretical reformers but they enjoyed the advantage 
of the light which had in the mean time been thrown 
upon the philosophy of science by the great practical 
advances of kepler galileo and others to these

tneoeetlcal reformers of science 

pictioal reformers we must soon turn our attention 
but we may first notice one or two additional circum 
stances beloiiging to our present subject 

oampanella remarks that both the peripatetics and 
the platonists conducted the learner to knowledge by a 
long and circuitous path which he wished to shorten 
by setting out from the sense without speaking of 
the methods which he propascd we may notice one 
maxim of considerable yalue which he propounds and 
to wdiich we have already been led “we begin to 
reason from sensible objects and definition is the end 
aiul epilogue of science it is not the beginning of our 
knowing but only of our teaching’ 

 andrew ccesalpinus — the sajn maxim had al 
ready been announciid by osesalpinus a contempoiury 
of telesius he was born at arezx in and died 
at rome in oasalpinus is a groat name in 
science though professedly an aristotelian it has 
been seen in the llietory of hcierice that he formed 
the first great epoch of the science of botany by his 
systematic arrangement of plants and that in this 
task he had no successor for nearly a century he 
also approached near to the great discovery of the 
circulation of the blood he takes a view of science 
which includes the remark that we have just quoted 
firora oampanella “we roach perfect knowledge by 
three steps induction division definition by in 
duction we collect likeness and agreement fiom ob 
servation by division we collect unlikeness and dis 
agreement by definition we learn the proper sub 
stance of each object induction makes uniyeisals 
from particulars and ofiers to the mind all intelligible 
matter division discovers the difference of univer 
sals and leads to species definition resolves species 
into their principles and elements”” without assert 
ing this to be rigorously correct it is incomparably 
more true and pmlosophical than the opposite view

 philosophy of discovjbrt 

which represents definition as the beginning of onr 
knowledge and the establishment of such a doctrine 
is a material step in inductive philosophy 

 giordano bruno — among the italian innova 
tors of this time we must notice the unfortunate gior 
dano bruno who was bom at nola about and 
burnt at rome in he is however a reformer of 
a different school from canipanella for he derives his 
philosophy from ideas and not from observation he 
represents himself as the author of a new doctrine 
which he terms the kclan philosophy ho was a 
zealous piomuigator and defender of the coperaican 
system of the universe as wo have noticed in the 
history of scienqc campanella also wrote in de 
fence of that system 

it is worthy of remark that a thought which is 
often quoted from francis bacon occui’s in bruno’s 
cena di genere published in mean the notion 
that the later times arc more aged than the earlier 
in the course of the dialogue the pedant who is one 
of the interlocutors says “ in antiquity is wisdom 
to which the philosojihical character replies if you 
knew what you were talking about you would see 
that your principle leads to the opposite result of that 
which you wish to infer — i mean that we are older 
and have lived longer than our predecessors” he 
then proceeds to apply this by tracing tlie course of 
astmiiomy through the earlier astronomers up to oo 
phrnious 

 peter riimms — i will notice one other reformer 
of this period who attacked the aristotelian system on 
another side on which it was considered to be most 
impregnable this was peter ramus born in picardy 
in who ventured to denounce the logic of aris 
totle as unphilosophical and uselesa after showtitg 
an extraordinary aptitude for the acquirement of know 
ledge in his youth when he roceeded to the degree 
o master of arts he astonished his examiners by

choosing for tho subject of the requisite disputation 
the thesis ‘hhat what aristotle has said is all 
wrong” this position so startling in he de 
fended for the whole day witliout leiiig defeated 
iliis was however only a formal academical exercie 
which did not necessarily imply any jermanent con 
viction of the opinion thus expressed but his mind 
was ready labouniig to detect and remedy the ermrs 
which he thus proclaimed from him as from the 
other reformers of this time we have an account of 
this mental struggle he says in work on this 
subject “ i will candidly and simply explain how i 
was delivered from the darkness of aristotle when 
according to the laws of onr university i had spent 
three yearn and a half in the aristotelian philosophy 
and was now invested with the philosophical laurel as 
a master of arts i took an account of tlie time which 
t luul consuiiied in this study and considered ou what 
subjects i should employ this logical art of aristotle 
which i liad learnt with so much labour and noises 
i found it made me not more versed in history or an 
tiquities more elocpient iu discourse more ready in 
verse more wise iu any subject alas for me how 
was i ovorpowenjd how deely did gioan how did 
i deplore my lot and my nature how did deem 
myself to bo by some unhappy and dismal fate anl 
frame of mind abhonent fiom the muses when t 
found that was one who after all my ains could 
reap no benefit from that wisdom of wliich i heard so 
much as being contained iu the logic of aristotle” 
he then relates that lie was led to the study of the 
dialogues of plato and was delighted with the kind 
of analysis of the subjects discussed which soomtes is 
there represented os executing ‘‘well’ he adds “ i 
began thus to reflect within myself — i should have 
thought it impious to say it to another — what i

pray you prevents me from socratizinff and from ask 
ing without regard to aristotle’s authority whether 
aristotle’s logic bo true and coriect it may be that 
that philosopher leads us wrong and if so no wonder 
that i cannot find in his books the treasure which is 
not there what if his dogmas be mere figments do 
i not tease and torment myself in vain trying to get 
a harvest from a barren soil ’ he connneed himself 
that the anstotelian logic was worthless and con 
structed a new system of logic founded mainly on the 
platonic process of exhausting a subject by analytical 
classification of its parts both works his atiimad 
versions on aristotle and his lotjtc appeared in 
the learned world was startled and shocked to find a 
young man on his first entranc e into life condemning 
as faulty fallacious and useless that part of aris 
totle’s works which had always hitherto been held as 
a masterpiece of philosophical acuteness and as the 
organon of scientific reasoning and ui tnith it 
must be granted tliat ramus does not appear to have 
understood the real nature and object of aristotle’s 
logic while his own system could not supply the 
dace of the old one and was not of much real value 
this dissent from the established doctrines was how 
ever not only condemned bat punished the printing 
and selling of his books was forbidden through frauce 
and ramus was stigmatized by a sentence® which 
declared him rash arrogant impudent and ignorant 
and prohibited from teaching logic and philosophy 
he was however afterwards rastored to the office of 
professor and though much attacked persisted in his 
plan of reforming not only logic but physics and 
metaphysics he made his position still more dan 
gerous by adopting the refomod religion and during 
the unhappy civil wars of france he was deprived of 
his professorship driven from paris and had his 
library plundered he endeavoured but in vain to 
engage a german professor schegk to undertake tlie

ltamuss main objection to the aristotelian logic 
is that it is not the image of the natural process of 
tliought an objection which shows little philosophical

may well differ from the ordof in winch our know

at philosophical reform but were connected rather 
with politics or religion but we cannot doubt that 
the spirit which led men to fissail the received philo 
sophy might readily incline them to reject some tenets 
of the established religion since the boundary line of 
those subjects is difficult to draw and as we have 
seen there was in most of the persons of whom we 
have spoken not only a wellfounded persuasion of 
the defects of existing systems but an eager siurit of 
change and a nguina anticipation of some wide and 
lolly jhilosophy which was soon to elevate the minds

for the most part the least temperate and judicious 
reforners patricius who as we have seen declared 
himself against the aristotelian philosophy lived and

 melancthon — it is not easy to oint out with 
precision the connexion between the effoas at a reform 
in philosophy and the great reformation of religion 
in the sixteenth century the disposition to assert 
practically at least a freedom of thinking and to 
reject the corruptions which tradition had introiluced 
and authority maintained naturally extended its in 
ducnce from one subject to another and especially in 
subjects so nearly connected as theology and philoso 
phy the protestants however did not reject the 
aristotelian system they only reformed it hy going 
back to the original works of the author and by re 
ducing it to a conformity with scripture in this 
reform melancthon was the chief author and wrote 
works on logic physics morals and metaphysics 
which were used among protastants on the subject 
of the origin of our knowledge his views contained a 
very philosophical improvement of the aristotelian 
doctrines he recognized the importance of ideas as

reater share in bringing about the change from sta 
tionaiy to progressive knowledge than those writora 
who so loudly announced the revolution the mode 
in which the philosophers of whom we now speak

the metaphysicians were exhorting men to consult ex

nature by such mdns with unparalleted success and 
while the former even when they did for a moment 
refer to facts soon rushed back into their own region 
of ideas anfd tried at once to seize the widest generali 
zatioqib the latter fastening their attention upon the

as no conjectural view of scientific method had sug

sought to depose had ruled the past ejracical 
reformers were cautious modest slow despisiog no 
knowledge whether borrowed from tradition or obser 
vation confident in the ultimate triumph of science 
but imjirehsed with the conviction that each single 
person could contiibute a little only to its progress 
yet though thus working mther than speculating — 
dealing with particulars more than with generals — 
employeil mainly in adding to knowlalge and not in 
defining what knowledge ia or jiow additions are to 
be made to it — these men thoughtful dbrious and of 
comprehensive minds were constantly lel to important 
views on the nature and methods of science and 
these views thus suggestxl vy reflections on their own 
mental activity were gradually incorporated with the 
more abs tract doctrines of the metaphysicians and 
liad a most important influence in jsttiblisliing an im 
proved philosophy of science the indications of such 
view we must now endeavoir to collect from the 
wiitings of the discoverers of the times preceding the 
seventeenth century 

some of the earliest of these indications arc to be 
found in those who dealt with art retlier than with 
science i have already endetivoured to show that the 
advance of the aits which give us a command over the 
powers of nature is generally prior to the foimation 
of exact and sjieculative knowledge concerning those 
powers but art which is thus the predecessor of 
science is among nations of acute anti twtive intellects 
usually its parent there operates in such a cuse a 
speculative spirit leading men to seek for the reasons 
of that which they find theiifeelves able to do how 
slowly and with what repeated deviations men follow 
this leading when under the influence of a partial and 
dogmatical philosophy the late birth and slow growth 
of sound physical theory shows but at the period of 
•which we now speak we find men at length proceed 
iftg in obedience to the impulse which thus drives them 
from practice to theory — from an acquaintance wjth 
phenomena to a free and intelligent inquiry coimemiug 
their cattses 



i philosophy op discovet 

 letmmdo da vind — bve already noted in 
the history of science that the indistinctness of ideas 
which was long one main impediment to the progress 
of science in the middle ages was first iemedied among 
architects and eugineeis these men so fiur at least as 
mechanical ideas were concerned were compelled by 
their employments to judge rightly of the relations and 
properties of the materials with which they had to deal 
and would have been chastised by the failure of their 
works if they had vioptel the laws of mechanical truth 
it was not wobderful therefore that these laws became 
known to them first we have seen in the 
that leonardo da vinci the celebrated painter who 
was also an cnghicer is the fimt writer in whom we 
find the true view of the laws of equilibnum of the 
lever in the most general case this artist a man of 
a lively and discursive mind is led to make some re 
marks on the formation of our knowledge which may 
show the opinions on that subject that already offered 
themselves at the lieginning of the sixteenth century 
he expresses himself m follows — “theory is the gene 
ral exeriments are the soldiers the interpreter of 
the artifices of nature is experience she is never de 
ceived our judgment sometimes is deceived because 
it expects effects which experience refuses to allow” 
and again ‘we must consult experience and vary 
the circumstances till we have drawn from them gene 
ial rules for it is she who furnishes true rules but 
of wliat use you ask are these rules i reply that 
they direct us in the researches of nature and the 
operations of art they prevent our impoedng upon 
ourselves and others b jiromising ourselves results 
which we cannot obtain 

“ in the study of the sciences which depend on mathe 
mattes those who do not consult nature but authors 
are not the children of nature they are only her grand

children she is the true teacher of men of genius 
but see the absurdity of men i they turn up their 
noses at a man who prefers to icam from nature her 
self rather than from authors who are only her clerks” 

in another place in i’eference to a particular ease 
he says “nature begins from the reason and ends in 
experience but for all that we must take the opposite 
course begin from the experiment and tiy to discxver 
the reason” 

leonardo was bom fortysix years before tclesius 
yet we have here an estimate of tfie valucftf exjerieuce 
far more just and substantial than the calabrian school 
ever reached the expressions contained in the above 
extracts are well worthy our notice that experience 
is never deceived — that we must vary our experi 
ments and draw from them general rules — that na 
ture is the original source of knowledge and looks 
only a derivative sulistitute — with a lively image of 
the sons and grandsons of nature some of these 
assertions have been deemed and not without reason 
very similar to those made by bacon a century later 
yet it is probable that the import of such expressions 
in ijeonaixlos mind was less clear and definite than 
tliat which they acquiied by the piogress of sound phi 
losophy when he says that theory is the general 
and experiments the soldiers he probably meant that 
theory directs men what experiments to make and 
lad not in his mind the notion of a theoretical idea 
ordering and brigading the facts when be says that 
experience is the inteipretcr of nature we may recol 
lect that in a more correct use of this image expe 
rience and nature are the writing and the intellect 
of man the interpreter we may add that the clear 
apprehension of the importance of experience led in 
this as in other cases to an unjust depreciation of the 
value of what science owed to booka leonardo would 
•have made little progress if he had attempted to master 
a complex science astronomvfor instance by means gf 
observation alone without the aid of books 

but in spite of such criticism leonardo’s maxima

rare such views are for a century after his time 

 copernicus — for we by no means find even in 
those practical discoverers to whom in reality the re 
volution in science and cjnsequently in the philosophy 
of science was due this prompt and vigorous recognition 
of the supreme authoiity of observation as a ground of 
belief this bold estimate of the probsible worthleasness 
of trtulitioiial knowledge and this plain assertion of 
the reality of theory founded upon experience among 
such discoverers copcriiicus must ever hold a most 
distinguished plicc the heliocentric theoiy of the 
universe established by him with vast labour and 
deep knowledge was for the succeeding centuiy the 
field of discipline and exertion of all the mt active 
speculative minds men during that time proved 
their frecdojn of thought their hopeful spirit aaid 
their comprehensive view by adopting inculcating 
and following out the philosophy which this theory 
suggested but in the first promuigation of the theory 
ill the works of copernicus himselt we find a tar 
more cautious and reserved temper he does not 
indeed give up the leality of his tlieoiy but lie ex 
presses himself so as co avoid shocking those who might 
as some aftiwards did think it safe to speak of it as 
an hypothesis lather tlxan a truth in his preface ad 
dressed to the pope® after speaking of the difiicultics 
in the old and received doctrines by which he was led 
to his own theory he says hence i legan to think 
of the mobility of tlie earth and although the opinion 
seemed absurd yet because i know that to othero le 
fore me this liberty had been conceded of imagiiiing 
any kinds of circles in order to explain the phenomena 
of the stars i thought it would also be readily granted 
me that might try whether by supposing the earth 
to in motion i might not anivo at a better expla 
nation than theirs of the revolutions of the celestial 
o‘bs’ nor does he anywhere assert that the seeming

absurdity had become a ceiiain truth or betray any 
feeling of triumph over the mistaken belief of his 
predecessors and as i liave elsewhere shown his 
disciples indignantly and justly defended him from 
the charge of disrespect towaixls ptolemy and other 
ancient astronomers y et copernicus is fiir from com 
promising the value or evidence of the great truths 
whicli he introduced to general acceptance and from 
sinking in liis exposition of his discoveries below tbe 
temper which had led to them his quotation from 
ptolemy that “he who is to follow phflosopliy must 
be a freeman iu mind” is a grand and noble maxim 
which it well became him to utter 

 fabneins — in another of thegreat discoverers 
of this period though employed on a veiy diifercnt sub 
ject we discern much of the siinie temper fabricius 
of acquapendeiite the tutor and forerunner of our 
harvey and one of that illustrious series of paduan 
rofeoi‘ who were the fathers of anatomy® exhibits 
something of the same respect tor antiquity in the 
midst of his original speculations thus in a dissct 
tjition’ on ifie action of ike jointsy he quotes aris 
totle’s mechanical problems to prove that in all ani 
mal motion there must be some quiescent fulcrum 
and finds merit even in aristotle’s ignorance “aris 
totle” he says “did not know that motion was 
produced by the muscle and after staggering aliout 
from one supposition to another at last is compelled 
by the facts themselves to recur to an innate spirit 
which he conceives is contrasted and which pulls 
and pushes and here we cannot help admiring the 
genius of aristotle who though ignorant of the ixius 
ole invents something which produces nearly the same 
effect us the muscle namely oontmetion and pulling” 
he then with great acuteness points out the dis 
tinction between aristotle’s opinions thus favourably 
jnterpreted and those of qalen in all this we see

somethidg of the wish to find all truths in the wiitings 
of the ancients but nothing which materiallr inter 
feres with iieedom of inquiry the anatomists have 
in ail ages and countries been practically employed in 
seeking knowledge from observation facts have ever 
been to them a subject of careful and profitable study 
while the ideas which enter into the wider truths of 
the science are as we have seen even still involved 
in obscurity doubt and contest 

 jtlfrtwozycies— francis maurolycus of messana 
whose mathematical works were published in was 
one of the gieat improvers of the science of optics in his 
time in his preface to his treatise on the spheres 
he speaks of previous writers on the same subject anil 
observes that as they have not superseded one another 
they have not rendered it unfit for any one to treat 
the subject afresh ‘‘yet” he says “it is impossible 
to amend the errors of all who have preceded us 
this would be a task too hard for atlas although he 
supports the heavens even copernicus is tolerated 
who makes the sun to be fixed and the earth to move 
round it in a circle and who is more worthy of a 
whip or a scourge thuji of a refutation” the mathe 
maticians and astronomeis of tliat time werte not the 
persons most sensible of the progress of physical know 
ledge for the basis of their science and a great part 
of its substance were contained in the writings of the 
ancients and till the time of kepler ptolemys work 
was very justly looked upon as including all that was 
essential in tlie science 

 benedelti — but the writex’s on mechanics were 
naturally led to piasent themselves as innovators and 
experimenters for all that the ancients had taxight 
concerning the doctrine of motion was erroneous 
while those who sought their knowledge from experi 
ment were constantly led to new truths john bap 
tist benedetti a venetian nobleman in pub 
ushed his spemlationum liberj containing among other 
matter a treatise on mechanics in wliich several of 
the aristotelian errors weie refuted in the preface 
to this treatise he says “ many authors have written 



practical reformers of science ill 

much and with great ability on mechanics but since 
nature is constantly bringing to light something either 
new or before unnoticed i too wished to put forth a 
few things hitherto unattempted or not sufficiently 
explained’’ in the doctrine of motion he distinctly 
and at some length condemns and aigues against all 
tlio aristotelian doctrines concerning motion weight 
and many other fundamental principles of physics 
benedotti is also an adherent of the coperniean doc 
trine he states the enormous velocity which the 
heavenly bodies must have if tfto eartlbe the centre 
of their motions and adds “ which difficulty does not 
occur according to the beautiful theory of tlio saiiiiaii 
aristarchus expounded in a divine manner by nicolas 
copernicus against which the reasons alleged by aris 
todo are of no weight” bcnedctti throughout shows 
no want of the coumge or ability which were needed 
in order to rise in opposition against the dogmas of 
the peripatetics he docs not however refer to ex 
periment in a very direct manner indeed most of the 
facts on wliich the elementary truths of mechanics 
iest were known and admitted by the aristotelians 
and tlierefore could not be adduced as novelties on 
the contrary he begins with d priori maxims which 
experience would not have confirmed “since” he 
says’ “we have undertaken the ttisk of proving that 
aristotle is wrong in his opinions concerning motion 
there aie certain absolute truths the objects of the 
intellect known of themselves w’hich we must lay 
down in the first place” and then as an example of 
these truths he states this “ any two bodies of equal 
sue and figure but of different materials will have 
their natiu velocities in the same proportion as their 
weights ” where by their natural velocities he means 
the velocities with which they naturally fall dowh

leit’s work on the magnet and on the magnetism of 
the earth appeared in and in this he repeatedly 
nuiintains the superiority of experimental knowledge 
over the physical philosophy of the ancients his 
preface opens thus since in making discoveries and 
searching out the hidden causes of things stroiigr 
reasons are obtained from trustworthy experiments 
and demonstrable argumeiits than from prolble con

inward constitution of the earth” as i have stated 
in the history of magnetism gilbert’s work con 
tains all the fundamental facts of that science so miy 
stated that we have at this day little to add to them 
he is not however by the advance which he thus 
made led to depreciate the ancients but only to claim 
for himself the same liberty of philosophizing which

tliey liad enjoyed to those ancient and first parents 
of philosophy aristotle theophrastus ptolemy hip 
pocrates galen be all due honour from them it was 
that the streatn of wisdom has been derived down to 
posterity but our age has discovered and brought 
to light many things which they if they were yet 
alive would gladly embrace wherefore we also shall 
not hesitate to expound by probable hypotheses those 
things which by long experience we have ascortairied’ 

in this work the author not only adopts the oojer 
nican doctrine of the earth’s motion bat speaks of 
the contrary supposition as “utterly absurd founding 
his argument mainly on the vast velocities which such 
a supposition requires us to ascribe to the celestial 
bodies dr gilbert was physician to queen elizabeth 
and to james the first and died in some time 
after his death the executors of his brother published 
another work of his de mundo ruysiro svhlunari fhi 
lobophia nova in which similar views are still more 
compreheusively presentecl in this he says “the 
two lords of philosophy aristotle and galen are held 
in worship like gods and rule the schools — the for 
mer by some destiny obtained a sway and iufiuence 
among philosopheis like that of his pupil alexander 
among the kings of the earth — galen with like suc 
cess holds his triumph among the physicians of eu 
rope” this comjarison of aristotle to alexander 
was also taken hold of by beeon nor is gilbert an 
unwbrthy precursor of bon in the view he gives of 
the jftistory of science which occupies the first three 
fdiapters of his philosophy he traces this history 
from “ the simplicity and ignorance of the ancients” 
through “ the fabrication of the fable of the four ele 
ments” to aristotle and galen he mentions with 
due disapproval the host of commentators which suc 
ceeded the alchemists the “shipwreck of science in 
the deluge of the goths” and the revival of letters 
and genius in the time of “ our grandfathers” “ thi

restor the greeks and latins to theii pristine grace 
and honour it remains that if they have written 
aught in error this should be remedied by better and 
more productive processes frugiferi instifcutis not 
to be contemned for their novelty for nothing which 
is true is really new but is perfect from eternity 
though to weak man it may bo unknown and that 
tlins philosophy may bear her fruit” the reader of 
bacon will not fail to recognize in these references to 
‘fruitbearing” knowledge a similiirity of expression 
with the novum oryawn 

bacon docs not appear to me to have done justice to 
his contempirary he nowhere rccogtiizea in the la 
bours of gilbert a community of purpose and spirit 
with his own on the other hand he casts upon him 
a reflection which he by no means deserves in the 
advancement of learning he says “ another error 
is that men have used to infect their meditations 
opinions and doctrines with some conceits which they 
lave most admired or some sciences to which they 
have most applied and given all things else a tinc 
ture according to them utterly untrue and improper 
so have the alchemists made a philosophy out of a 
few experiments of the furnace and gillcrtus our 
countiyman lath made a philosophy out of the ob 
servations of a loadstone” in the latin philosopliiam 
etiam e magneto olicuit and in the same manner 
he mentions him in the novum organon as afford 
ing an example of an empirical kind of philosophy 
which appears to those daily conversant with the ex 
periments probable but to other persons incredible 
and empty but instead of blaming gilbert for dis 
turbing and narrowing science by a too constant re 
ference to magnetical rules we might rather censme 
bacon for not seeing how important in all natural 
philosophy are those laws of attraction and repulsioi 
of which magnetical phenomena are the most obvious

illustration we may find ground for such a judg 
ment in another passage in which bacon speaks of 
gilbert in the second book” of the novum orga 
non having classified motions he gives as one kind 
what he calls in hia figurative language motion for 
gain or motion of need by which a body shuns hete 
rogeneous and seeks cognate bodies and he adds 
“the electrical operation conceimiiig which gilbert 
and others since him have made up such a wonderfhl 
story is nothing less than thev appetite of a body 
which excited by friction does not well tolerate the 
air and prefei’s another tangible body if it be found 
near” bacon’s notion of an appetite in the body is 
certainly much less philosophical thdn gilbert’s who 
speaks of liglit bodies as drawn towards amber by 
certain material radii® and we might perhaps ven 
ture to say that bacon here manifests a want of clear 
mechanical ideas bacon too showed his inferior 
aptitude for physical research in rejecting the copei 
uicari doctrine which gilbert adopted in the ad 
vancefnent of learning suggesting a history of tfie 
opinions of pliilosopliers he says that he would have 
inserted in it even recent theories as those of para 
celsus of telesius who restored the philosophy of 
parmenides or patricius who resiiblimed the fumes 
of platonism or gilbert who brought back the dog 
mas of philolaus but bacon quotes® with pleasure 
gilbert’s ridicule of the peripatetics’ definition of 
heat they had said that heat is that which sepa 
rates heterogeneous and unites homogeneous matter 
which said gilbert is as if any one were to define 
¦man as that which sows wheat and plants vines 

galileo another of gilberta distinguished contem 
poraries had a higher opinion of him he says “i 
extremely admire and envy this author i think him 
worthy of the greatest praise for the many now and 
ni observations which ho has made to the disgiuce

of q many vain and fabling authors who writer not 
from their own knowledge only but repeat everything 
they hear from the foolish and vulgar yithout at 
tempting to satisfy themselves of the same by experi 
ence perhaps that they may not diminish the size of 
their books” 

 galileo — galileo was content with the active and 
successful practice of experimental inquiry and did 
not demand that such researches should be made ex 
pressly subservient tq that widei and more ambitious 
philosophy on which the author of the novum organon 
employed bis powers but still it now becomes our 
business to trace those portions of galileos views which 
have reference td the theory as well as the practice 
of scientific investigation on this subject galileo did 
not think more profoundly perhaps than several of his 
contemporaries but in the liveliness of expression and 
illustration with which he recommended lik opinions 
on such topics he was unrivalled writing in the lan 
guage of the people in the attractive form of dialogue 
mth clearness grace and wit ho did far more an 
any of his predecessors had done to render the new 
methods results and prospects of science familiar to a 
wide circle of readers fii’st in italy and soon all over 
europe the piincipal points inculcated by him were 
already becoming familiar to men of active and inquir 
ing minds such as — that knowledge was to be sought 
from observation and not from books — that it was 
absurd to adhere to and debate abou the physical 
tenets of aristotle and the rest of the ancients on 
persons who followed this latter course galileo fixed 
the epithet of paper philosophers” because as he 
wrote in a letter to kepler this sort of men fancied 
that philosophy was to be studied like the jeneid or 
odyseee and that the true reading of nature was to bo 
detected by the collation of texts nothing so much 
shook the authority of the received system of physics 
as the experimental discoveries directly contradicting 





practical reformers of science ii 

it which galileo made by experiment as i have 
elsewhere stated he disproved the aristotelian doc 
trine that bodies fall quickly or slowly in pioportion 
to their weight and when he had invented the tele 
scope a number of new discoveries of the most striking 
kind the inequalities of the moon’s surface the spots 
in the sun the moonlike phases of venus the satel 
lites of jupiter the ring of saturn showed by the 
evidence of the eyes how inadequate were the concep 
tions and how erroneous the doctrines of the ancieui 
respecting the constitution of the nniversv how severe 
the blow was to tlie disciples of the ancient schools we 
may judge by the extraordinary forms of defence in 
which they tried to intrench themselves they would 
not look through galileo’s glasses they umiiitained 
that what was seen was an illusion of witchcraft and 
they tried as galileo says with logical arguments as if 
with magical ineantatious to charm the new planets 
out of the sky no one could bo better fitted than 
giilileo for such a warfare his great knowledge clear 
intellect gaiety and light irony with the advantage 
of being in the right enabled him to play with his 
adversaries as he pletised thus when an aristotelian 
rejected the discovery of the irregularities in the moon’s 
surface because according to the ancieut doctrine her 
form was a perfect sphere and held that the appaient 
cavities were filled with an invisible crystal sutance 
galileo replied that lie had no objection to assent to 
thisbut that then he should require lus adversary in 
return to believe that there were on the same sur 
face invisible crystal mountains ten times as high as 
those visiblo ones which he had actually observed and 
measured 

we find in galileo many thoughts which have 
since become established maxims of modern philoso 
phy ‘‘philosophy” he says “is written in that 
great book i mean the universe which is constantly 
open before our eyes bat it cannot be understood

unless we first know the language and loam the 
characters in which it is written” with this thought 
he combines some other lively images one of his 
interlocutors says concerning another ‘sarsi perhaps 
thinks that philosophy is a book made up of the fan 
cies of men like the iliad or orlando furioso in 
which the matter of least importance is that what 
is written bo true” and again with regard to the 
system of authority he says “i think i discover in 
him a firm belief that in philosophizing it is necessary 
to lean upoiithe opihion of some celebrated author 
as if our mind must necessarily remain unfruitful and 
barren till it be married to another mans reason” — 
“no” he says ‘ithe case is not so — when we have 
the decrees of nature authority goes for nothing 
reason is absolute’” 

in the course of galileo’s controversies questions of 
the logic of science camo under discussion vincenzio 
di grazia objected to a proof from induction which 
galileo aflduced because all the particulars were not 
enumerated to which the latter justly replies that if 
induction were required to pass through all the cases 
it would be either useless or impossible — impossible 
when the cases are innumerable useless when they 
have each already been verified since then the general 
proposition adds nothing to our knowledga 

one of the most novel of the character which 
science assumes in galileo’s hands is that she becomes 
cautious she not only proceeds leaning upon exeri 
ence but she is content to proceed a little way at a 
time she already begins to perceive that she must 
nse to the heights of knowledge by many small and 
separate steps the philosopher is desiroi to know 
much but resigned to be ignorant for a time of that 
which cannot yet be known thus when galileo dis 
covered the true law of the motion of a falling body 
tliat the velocity incres proportionally to the time 
if om the beginning of the he did nrft insist npan 


 naogiatrel too ilkdl

immediately assigning the cause of this law ‘‘the 
cause of the accelemtion of the motions of falling 
bodies is not” he says “a necessary part of the in 
vest gation” yet the conception of this acceleration 
as the resuit of the continued action of the force of 
gravity upon the falling body could hardly fail to 
suggst itself to one who had formed ihe idea of force 
in like manner the tnith that the velocities acquired 
by bmlies falling ‘down planes of equal lieights are all 
fqual avas known to galileo and his disciples long

parently so obvious that the momentum geriemtcd

not tempted to laish at once from an experimental 
truth to a universal system cienoe had learnt that 
she must move ate by step and the gravity of her 
lacc already indicated her appmaching maturity and 
her consciousness of the long path which lay befuro 
lier 

but besitles the genuine philosophical prudence which 
thus avithheld galileo fiom leaping hastily from one 
inference to another he had perhaps a preponderating 
inclination towards facts and did not feel so much as 
some other peraons of his time the need of reducing 
them to ideas he could bear to contemplate laws of 
motion without being urged by an uncontrollable desire 
to refer them to conceptions of force 

 kepler — in tliis respect his friend kepler differed 
from him for kepler was restless and unsatisfied till 
he had i’educed facts to laws and laws to causes and 
never acquiesced in ignorance though he tested with 
the most rigorous scrutiny that which presented itself 
in the shape of knowledge to fill the void it may be 
seen in the history of astronomy with what per 
severance energy and fertility of invention kepler 
puisued his lalmurs enlivened and relieved by the 
 most curious freaks of fancy with a view of discover

victory is vain and that the wir is raging anew as

he had proposed didot coincide with the facts — he 
by no means desisted from his attempts but “suddenly 
sent into the field a reserve of new physical reasonings 
oil the rout and dispeision of the vetenins” that is 
tried new suppositions suested by such views as he 
then entertained of the celestial motions his effcrts 
to obtain the formal laws of the planetaiy motions 
resulted in some of the most iuqiortant discoveries 
ever made in astronomy and if his jhysical reason 
ings were for the time fruitless this arose only from 
the want of that discipline in mechanical ideas which 
the minds of mathematicians bad still to undergo for 
the great discoveries newton in the next generation 
showed that in reality the next step of the advance 
was in this direction among all keplers fantastical 
expressions the fundamental thoughts were sound and 
true namely that it was his business as a physical 
investigator to discover a mathematical rule which 
governed and included all the special cts and that 
the rules of the motions of the planets must conform 
to some conception of causation 

the same oharacteristics — the conviction of rule and 
cause persevemaee in seeking these inventiveness in 
devising hypotheses love of truth in trying and re 
jecting them and a lively fancy playing with the 
heasou without interrupting her — appear also in his 
work on optics in which he tried to discover the 
emet law of optical refraction in this undertaking

saying “now reader you and i liave been detained

in this and in other expressions we see how clearly 
he apprehended that colliyation of facta which is the

oculiar endowments and habits kepler exliibiu an

and candour in resigning them if these results dis

and are fortunately exliibited to us in the most lively 
manner in his own garrulous narratives galileo uiged 
men by precept os well as example to begin their phi

practice that tliey must proceed from olservation by 
means of hypotheses the one insistcil upon facts

foiotten the necessity of ideas as well as jpacts for 
all theory or who have overlooked the impossibility 
of selecting and explicating our ideas without a good 
deal of spontaneous play of the mind it must how 
ever always be recollected that keplers genius and 
fancy derived all their scientific value fiom his genuine 
and uiimingled love of truth these qualities appeared 
not only in the judgment he passed upon hypotheses 
but also in matters which more immediately concerned 
ilia reputation thus when galileo’s discovery of the 
telescope dispioved acvoral opinions which kepler had 
publishcd and strenuously maintained he did not hesi 
tate a moment to retract his assertions and range him 
self by the side gf galileo whom he vigorously sup 
ported in his warfare against those who were incapable 
of thus cheerfully acknowledging the triumph of new 
facts over their old theories 

 tycho — there remains one eminent astronomer 
the friend and fellowlabourer of kepler whom we must 
not separate from him as one of the uactical reformers 
of science i speak of tycho brahe who is i think 
not justly appreciated by the litemry world in genera 
in consequence of his having made a retrograde ste 
in that jortion of astronomical theory which is most 
familiar to the popular mind though he adopted the 
copemican view of the motion of the planets about 
the sun he refused to acknowledge the annual and 
diurnal motion of the earth but notwithstanding 
this mistake into which he was led by his interpreta 
tion of scripture rather than of nature tycho must 
ever be one of the greatest names in astronomy in 
the philosophy of science also the influence of what 
he did is r fixm inconsiderable and especially its 
value in bringing into notice these two points — that 
not only are observations the beginning of science imt 
that the progress of science may often depend upon 
the observer’s pursuing his task regularly and crefially 
for a long time and with well devised instruments 
and again that observed facts offer a mccetivon of 
laws which we disccjver as our observations become 
better and as our theories are better adapted to the 



practical reformers of science 

observations with regard to the former point tycho’s 
observatory was far sujkjrior to all that had preceded 
it not only in the optical but in the mechanical 
arrangements a matter of almost equal consequence 
and hence it was that his observations inspired in 
kepler that confidence which led him to au his la 
bours and all his discoveries “sinc” he says®® “the 
divine goodness has given us in tyclio brhe an exact 
olserver from whose observations this error of eight 
minutes in the calculations of the ptolemaic hypothesis 
is detected let us acknowledge nd make use of this 
gift of cod and since this error cannot be neglected 
these eight minutes alone have prepared the way for 
an entire relbrm of astronomy ad are to be the 
main subject of this work” 

with ngard to tycho’s discoveries respecting the 
moon it is to be recollected that besides the fiist in 
fhuality of the moon’s motion the equation of the 
centre arising from the elliptical form of her orbit 
ptolemy had discovered a second inequality tlie evec 
tion wliich as wti have observed in the histoiy of 
this subject might have naturally suggested the sus 
picion that there were still other ineijualities in the 
middle ages however such suggestions implying a 
constant progress in science were little attended to 
and we have seen that when an arabian astrono 
mer had really discovered another inequality of the 
moon it was soon forgotten because it had no place in 
the established systems tycho not only rediscovered 
the lunar inequality the variation thus once before 
won and lost but also two other inequalities namely® 
the change of inclination of the moon’s orbit as the 
line of nodes moves round and an inequality in the 
motion of the line of nodes thus as i have else 
where said it appcoied that the discovery of a rule 
is a step to tlie discovery of deviations from that 
rule which require to bo expressed in other rules it

became manifest to astronomers and through them to 
all philosopher that in the application of theory to 
observation we find not only the stated phenomena 
for which the theory does account but also residuaz 
phenamenaf which are unaccounted for and remain 
over and above the calculation and it was seen fur 
ther that these residual phenomena might be alto 
gether or ipart exhausted by new theones 

 these were valuable lessons and the more valuable 
inasmuch as men were now trying to lay down maxims 
fud methods ibr the cfinduct of science a revolution 
was not only at hand but had really taken place in 
the great body of real cultivators of science the 
occasion now ioquired that this revolution should be 
foimally recognized — that the new intellectual power 
shotild be chthed with the forms of government — 
that the new philosophical republic should be acknow 
ledged as a sister state by the ancient dynasties of 
aristotle and plato there was needed some great 
theoretical reformer to speak in the name of the 
experimental philosophy to lay before the world a 
declaration of its rights and a scheme of its laws and 
thus our eyes are turned to francis bacon and others 
who like him attempted this great office quit 

tliose august and venerable names of discoverers whose 
appearance was the prelude and announcement of the 
new state of things then opening and in doing so we 
may apply to them the language which bacon applies 
to himself —

eranois bacon 


i i general itennarlpb — jftp is a raatter of some 
difliculty to speak of the character and merits of this 
illustrious man as regards his place in that philosophical 
history with which we are here engaged if we were to 
content ourselves with estimating him according to the 
oihce which as we have just seen he claims for himself 
as merely the harbinger and announcer of a sounder 
method of scientific inquiry than that which was ie 
cognized before him the task would be comparatively 
easy for we might select from his writings those 
passages in which he has delivered opinions and point 
ed out processes then novel and strange but since 
confirm by the experience of actual discovercre and 
by ’the judgments of the wisest of succeeding philoso 
phers and we might pass by without disispect but 
without notice maxims and proposals which have not 
been found available for use — views so indistinct and 
vague that we are even yet unable to pixmounce upcm 
their justice — and bouudless anticipations dictated by 
the sanguine hopes of a noble and comprehensive in 
tellect but if we thus reduce the philosophy of 
bacon to that portion which the subsequent progress 
of science has rigorously verified we shall have to pass 
over many of those declarations which have excited 
most notice in his writings and shall lose sight of 
many of those striking thoughts which his admirers 
 most love to dwell upon for he is usually spoken

ofy at least in this country as a teacher who not only 
commenced but in a great measure completed the 
philosophy of induction he is considered not only 
as having asscited some general piinciples but laid 
down the special rules of scientific investigation as 
not only one of tlie founders but the supreme legis 
lator of the modern republic of science not only tho 
hercules o slew the monsters that obstructed the 
earlier traveller but the solon who established a con 
stitution fitted for allfuture time 

 nor iit our purpose to deny that of such 
praise he deserves a share which considering the ie 
riod at which he lived is truly astonishing but it is 
iiecessaiy for us in tliis place to discriminate and select 
that portion of his system which bearing npon physical 
science has since been confirmed by the actual history 
of science many of bacons most impressive and caj 
tivflting passages contemplate the extension of tho new 
methods of discovering truth to intellectual to moral 
to political as well lus to physical science and how 
far and how the advantages of tho inductive method 
may be secured for those important branches of specu 
lation it will at some future time be a highly inter 
esting task to examine but our plan requucs us at 
present to omit the consideration of these for our 
purpose is to learn what the genuine course of the for 
mation of science is by tracing it in those poi’tions of 
human knowledge which by the confession of all aie 
most exact most certain most complete hence we 
must here deny ourselves the dignity dnd interest 
which float about all speculations in which the great 
moral and political concerns of inen are involved it 
cannot be doubted that the commanding position which 
bacon occupies in men’s estimation arises from his 
yiroclaiming a reform in philosophy of so comprehen 
sive a nature — a reform which was to infiise a new 
spirit into every part of knowledge physicalscience 
has tranquilly and noiselessly copied many of his 
suggestions which were indeed her own natorid im 
pulses not borrowed from him and she is too deisfly 
and satisfiictorily absorbed in contemplating

suits to talk much about the methods of obtaining 
tiiem which she has thus instinctively pursued but 
the philosophy which deals with mind with manners 
with morals with polity is conscious still of much ob 
scurity and perplexity and would gladly borrow aid 
from a system in which aid is so confidently promised 
he aphorisms and phrases of the novum organon are 
tar more frequently quoted by metaphysical ethical 
and even theological writers than they are by the au 
thors of works on physics 

 again even sis regaids fdiysics •biicon’s fame 
rests upon something besides the novelty of the max 
ims which he promulgated that a revolution in the 
method of scientific research was going on all the 
greatest physical investigatcis of the sixteenth century 
were fully awaih as we have shown in the last chap 
ter but their wiitings conveyed this conviction to 
thfe public at large somewhat slowly men of letters 
men of the worltl men of rank did not become fa 
miliar with the abstruse works in wliich these views 
were published and alove ail they did not by such 
occasional glimpses as they took of the state of physi 
cal science become aware of the magnitude and conse 
quences of this change but bacon’s lofty eloquence 
wide learning comirehensive views bold pictures of 
the coming state of tilings wore fitted to make men 
turn a far more general and earnest gaze ujion the 
passing change when a man of his acquirements of 
hi talents of his rank and position of his gravity and 
caution poured forth the strongest and loftiest expres 
sions and images which his mind could supply in 
order to depict the ‘great instauration” which he 
adiiouiice — in order to contnist the weakness the 
blindnesi the ignorance the wretchedness under 
which men hod laboured while they followed the long 
beaten track witli the light the power the privileges 
 which they were to find in tlie paths to which he 
pointed — it was impossible that readers of all classes

proplietio eloquence in vrhidi so great sttlilaot imi 
presented and when it found that pro 
phecy was verified when it appeared that animnnense 
change in the methods of scientific research really aad 
occuited — that vast additions to man’s knowledge 
and power had been acquired in modes like them 
wliicli had been spoken of — that further advancq 
might be constantly looked for — and that a progress 
seemingly boundless was going on in the direction in 
which the seer had thus pointed — it was natured that 
men should hail himas the leader of the revolution 
that they should identify him with the event which he 
was the first to announce that they should look upon 
him as the authoa of that which he had as they per 
ceived so soon and so thoroughly comprehended 

 for wc must remark that although as we 
have seen he was not the only nor the earliest 
wiiter who declared that the time was come for such 
a change he not only proclaimed it more emphatically 
but understood it in its general character much more 
exactly than any of his contemporaries among the 
maxims suggestions and anticipations which he threw 
out there were many of which the wisdom and the 
novelty were alike striking to hie immediate succes 
sors — thore are many which even now from time to 
time we find fresh reason to admire for their acute 
ness and justice bacon stands for above the herd of 
loose and visionary speculators who before and about 
his time spoke of the establishment of new fouoeo 
phiea if we must select some one philosopher as the 
ilero of the revolution in scientific method bond all 
doubt francis bacon must occupy the place of honour 

we shall however no longer dwell npon these 
general considerations but shall proceed to notice some 
of the more peculiar and chaacterietic features of 
bacon’s philosophy and especially those views which 
occurring for the firrt time in his writings have been 
fidly illustrated and nfirmed by the subsequent pro 
gress of science and have become a portion of the per 
manent philosophy of our times 

it a new jera mimwieed — the first great

fefuiure whicli trikes us in bftcon’s philosophical views 
is that whi we have already noticed — his confident 
tuid emphatic announcement of a new jsra in the pro

former times were poor and trifiing this was with 
bacon no loose and shallow opinio taken up on light

this philosophy have never made it their main study 
but have used it as a passage or lrawbridge to serve 
other objects and thus he says the great mother of 
the sciences is tlirust down with indignity to the of 
fices of a handmaid is made to minister to the jabours 
of medicine or mathematics or to give the first prepa 
ratory tinge to the immature minds of youth for 
these and similar considerations of the errors of past 
time he draws hope for the future employing the 
same argument whieji demosthenes uses to the athe 
nians “ that which is worst in the events of the pist 
is the best as a ground of trust in thf future for 
if you had dfuie all tliat became you and still had 
been in this condition your ciise might bo desperate 
but since your failure is the result of your own mis 
takes there is good hope that correcting the eiwr of 
your course you may reach a prosperity yet unknown 
to you” 

iii a change of existing metiml — all bacon’s 
hope of improvement indeed was placed in an entire 
change of the method by whicli science was pursued 
and the boldness and at the same time the then 
existing state of science being considered the definite 
ness of ids views of the change that was rckiuisitc are 
truly remarkable 

that all knowledge must begin with observation is 
one great principle of bacon’s philosophy but i hardly 
think it necessary to notice the inculcation of this 
maxim as one of his main services to the caiuse of sound 
knowledge since it had as wc have seen been fiiuy 
insisted upon by others before him and was growing 
rapidly into general acceptance without his aid but 
if he was not the first to tell men that they must eol 
lect their knowledge from observation he had no rival 
ill his peculiar office of teaching them how science 
must thus be gathered from experience 

it appears to me that by far the most extraordins 
•parts of bacon’s works are those in which with extteme 
earnestness and clearness he insists upon a gmiimsiod 
and successive indveion as opposed to a hay transit 
from sjiecial facts to the highest generalissatiotm lhe

nineteeiitli axiom of the first book of the novum 
orgauotb contains a view of the nature of true science 
most exact and profound and so far as am aware 
at the time perfectly new “ theje are two ways and 
km only bo two of seeking and finding truth the one 
from sense and particulais takes a flight to the most 
gonemi axionus and from those principles and their 
truth settled once for all invents and judges of inter 
mediate axioms the other method collects axioms 
from sense and particnlai‘s aiiccndiiig conmwusfy md 
hy degrees so that in the end it arrives at the most 
general axioms this hitter way is the true one but 
hitherto untried’’ 

it is to remarked that in this passage bacon 
employs the term axioms to express any proiositions 
collected from facts by induction and tlius fitted to 
become the startingoiut of deductive reasonings 
ifow far propositions so obtfiined may approach to the 
character of axioms in the more rigorous sensi of the 
term we have already in some measure examined 
but that question does not here immediately concern 
us the truly ‘eniarkable circumstance is to find this 
iecommendation of a coiitinnous advance from observa 
tiou by limited steps through successive gradations of 
gouemlity given at a time when speculative men in 
general had only just begun to erceive that they must 
begin their bourse from exjerienco in some way or 
other how exactly this description represents the 
general structure of the soundest and most compre 
hensive physical theories all persons who have studied 
the progress of science up to modem times can bear 
testimony but perhaps this structui’c of science can 
not in any other way be made so apparent os by those 
tables of successive generalissatious in which we have 
exhibited the history and constitution of some of the 
principal physical sciences in the chapter of a pre 
pttding work which treats of the logic of induction 
and the view which bacon thus took of the true pro 
gross of science was not only new but so far os i am 
aware has never been adequately illustrated up to the 
piostmt day 



 philosophy op discovert 


 it is true as i obsoived in the last chapter that 
galileo had been led to see the neccasity not only of 
proceeding from experience in the pursuit of know 
ledge but of proceeding cautiously and gradually and 
he had exemplified this rule more than once when 
having made one step in discoveiy he held back his 
foot for a time from the next step however tempting 
but galileo had not reached this wide and command 
ing view of the successive subordination of many stex 
all leading u at lastto some wide and simple general 
truth in catching sight of this principle and in 
ascribing to it its due importance bacon’s sagacity so 
far as i am aware wrought unassisted and unrivalled 

 nor is there any wavering or vagueness in bacon’s 
assertion of this important tmth lie repeats it over 
and over again illustrates it by a great number of 
the most lively metaphors and emphatic expressions 
thus he speaks of the siiccessivo floor n tahulauc of 
induction and sixsaks of each science as a pyramid 
which has observation md exjorience for its basis 
no images can better exhibit the relation of general 
and particular truths as our own inductive tables 
may serve to show 

iv comparison of tlve nev and old method 
again not less remarkable is his contrastiug this 
true method of science while it was alinost as he 
says yet untried with the ancient and vidmis method 
which began indeed writh facts of observation but 
rushed at once and with no gradations to the most 
general principles for this was the course which had 
been actually followed by all those sioculative re 
formers who had talked so loudly of the necessity of 
beginning our philosophy from experience all these 
men if they attempted to frame physical doctrines at 
all had caught up a few facts of observation and had

eiected a universal theory upon the suggestions which 
these olferecl this process of illicit generalization or 
as bacon terms it anticiatiqn of nature afuicipatio 
tiaturce in opposition to the inteiiretation of nature 
he depicts with singular acuteness in its character and 
causes “these two ways” he says “iwth begin from 
sense and particulais but their discrepancy is immense 
the one merely skims over experience and particulars 
in a cursory transit the other deals with them in a 
due and orderly manner the gne at its very outset 
frames certain general abstract principlss but useless 
the other gradually nses to those principles which have 
a real existence in nature” 

“the former path” he adds “that of ieicit and 
hasty gcneialization is one which the intellect follows 
when aliandoned to its own impulse and this it does 
from the requisitions of logic for the mind has a 
yearning which makes it dait forth to genendities 
tliat it may have something to rest m and after a 
little dallying with experience becomes weary of it 
and all these evils are augmented by logic which re 
quiis these generalities to make a show with in its 
disptitations” 

“in a sober patient grave intellect” he further adds 
“the mind by its own impulse and more especially if 
it be not impelled by the sway of established opinions 
attempts in some measure that otlier and true way of 
giudual genemlization but this it does with small 
profit for the intellect except it be regiilated and 
aided il a iaculty of unequal operation and altogether 
unt to master the obscurity of things” 

tlie profound and searching wisdom of these remarks 
appears more and moie as we apply them to the vaii 
ous attempts which men have made to obtain know 
ledge when they begin with the contemplation of a 
few cts and pursue their speculations as upon most 
subjects they have hitherto generally done for almost 
all such attempts have led immediately to some process

of illicit generalization nliich introduces an intermin 
aide course of controversy in the physical sciences 
however we have the ftirther inestimable advantage 
of seeing the other aide of the contrast exemplified 
for many of them as our inductive tables show na 
have gone on according to the most ligorous conditions 
of gradual and successive generalization and in con 
sequence of this circumstance in their constitution 
ossess in each part of their structure a solid trutli 
which is always ready to stand the severest tests of 
reasoning and experiment 

we see how justly and clearly bacon judged con 
cerning the mode in which facte are to be employed in 
tlie construction of science this indeed has ever 
been deemed his great merit insomuch that many 
persons apear to ajprehend the main substance of 
his doctrine to reside in the maxim that facts of obser 
vatioii and such facts alone are the essential elements 
of all true science 

v idem are meessary — yet we have en 
deavoured to establish the doctrine that facts are 
but one of two ingredients of nowlelgo both equally 
necessary — that ideas are no less indispensable than 
facts themselves and that except these be duly un 
folded and applied facts are collected in vain has 
bacon then neglected this great portion of his subject 
has he been led by some partiality of view or some 
peculiarity of circumstances to leave this curious and 
essential element of science in its nstine obscurity 
was he unaware of its interest and importancdl 

we may reply aat bacon’s philoaohy in its effect 
upon his readers in general does not give due weight 
or due attention to the ideal element of our know 
ledge he is considered as peculiarly and eminently 
the asserter of the value of experiment and observar 
tioin he is always understood to belong to the ex 
eriential as oppo to the ideal school he is held 
up in contiast to plato and others who love to dwell 
upon that part of knowledge which has its origin in 
the intellect cs man 

ix kov can it be denied that bacon has in the

fiulshod part of his novum organon put promineutly 
forwards the necessary dependence of all our know 
ledge ujk experience and said little of its depend 
ence equally necessary upon the conceptions which 
the intellect itself supplies it will appear however 
on a close examination that he was by no means in 
sensible or careless of tliia internal element of all con 
nected speculation he held tjie balance with no 
jartial or feeble liand letween phenomena and ideas 
ht urged the colligation of fiicts but ho was not the 
less awtue of the value of the expliditioii of con 
ceptions 

 this appears plainly from some romaikahle 
aphorisms in the nowm orgaaoa thus in noticing 
the causes of the little progress then made by science 
he states this — ‘in the current notions all is un 
sound whether they bo logical or physical svhstaiice 
quality action paasion even bemg are not good con 
ceptions still less arc heacy ught dense rarcy ttwisty 
drijy generodioriy corrupthay aliractiony repulsion efe 
menty matter y form and others d that kind all are 
fantastical and illdchned” and in his attempt to 
exemplify his own syshin he hesitates in accepting 
or rejecting the notions of eunvtuary celestud rare 
as belonging to fire since as ho says tliey are vague 
and illdefined notions pmioties vagm nec hem termi 
nate in that part of his work which appears to bo 
completed there is not so far as i have noticed any 
attempt to fix and define any notions thus complained 
of as lobse and obscure but yet such an undertaking 
appears to have formed part of his plan and in the 
abecedarium naturce which consists of the heads of 
luious oiiion of his great scheme marked by letters 
of the alphabet we find the titles of a series of dis 
sertations “ on the conditions of being” which must 
have had for their object the elucidation of divers 
notions essential to science and which would have

been conitibiitionb to tbe explication of conceptions 
sock m wo have attempted in a former part of this 
jrdrki thus some of the subjects of these disserta 
ons are — of much and little — of durable am 
traufidtoiy — of natural and monstrous — of natu 
ral and artificial when the philosopher of induction 
vcame to discuss these considered as catbsuions of ex 
i teice he could not do otherwise than develope limit 
methodize and define the ideas involved in these 
notions so as to make them consistent with them 
selves and afit basirfof demonstiative reasoning his 
task would have been of the same nature as ours has 
been in that part of this work which treats of the 
fundamental ideas of the vaiioiis classes of sciences 

 thus bacon in his speculative philosophy 
took firmly hold of both the handles of science and 
if he had completed his scheme would probably have 
given due attention to ideas no less than to facts as 
an element of our knowledge while in his view of 
the general method of ascending from facts to princi 
ples he displayed a sagacity truly wonderful but 
we cannot be surprised that in attempting to ex 
eikplify the method which heccoiiimended he should 
have failed for the method could be exemplified 
only by some important discovery in physical science 
and great discoveries even with the most perfect 
meths do not come at command moreover al 
though the general structure of his scheme was cor 
rect the precise imiort of some of its details could 
hardly bo understood till the actual irogress of science 
had made men somewhat familiar with the kind of 
stejis which it included 

vi bacon example — accordingly bacon’ 
inquisition ituo ike naiwre of which is given in 
the second book of the novum organon as an ex 
ample of the mode of interrogating nature cannot be 
looked upon otherwise tlian as a complete failure 
 tins will bo evident if we consider that although the 
exact nature of heat is still an obscuic and contro 
verted matter tbe science of heat now consists of 
many important truths and that to none of these

traths is there any approximation id ods essay 
prom his process he at this asthcf or 

inie definition” of heat that it is an exeiisve 

restrained motion modified in certain ways and es 
crted ill the smaller particjes of the body” but the 
steps by which the science of heat really advanced 
were as may be seen in tho history® of the subject 
these — the discovery of a measrure of heat or tem 
perature the thermometer the establishment of the 
laws of conduction and radiation of the laics of sptj 
cific heat latent heat and the like shch steps have 
led to amire’s hypotliesis that heat consists in the 
vibrations of an imfonderable fluid and to laplaces 
hppotluisisy that temerature consishs in the internal 
radiation of such a fluid these hypotheses cannot 
yet be said to bo even probable but at least they are 
so modifled as to include some of the preceding laws 
which are firmly established whereas bacon’s hypo 
thetical motion includes no hiws of phenomena ex 
plains no process and is indeed itself an example of 
illicit generalization 

ig one main giound of bacoii’s ill fortune in this 
undertaking appears tb be that ho was not aware of 
an important maxim of inductive science that we 
iiiu first obtain the measure and ascertain the laws 
of phenomena befoio we endeavour to discover their 
causes the whole history of thcrinotics up to the 
iresent time has been occupied with the fomwr steji 
and the task is not yet comjleted it is no wonder 
therefore that bacon failed entirely when he so pre 
maturely attempted the secoud his sagacity had 
taught him that the progress of science must be gra 
 dual but it had not led him to judge adequately how 
gradual it must be nor of what different kinds of 
inquiries taken in due order it must needs consist 
in order to obtain success 

another mistake which could not fail to render 
it unlikely that bacon sliould really exemplify bis

precepts by any actual advance in science was that 
lie did not justly appreciate the sagacity tlie inventive 
genius wliich all discovery inquires he conceived 
that he could supersede the necessity of such peculiar 
eudowments “ our method of discoveiy in science” 
he says’ “is of such a nature that there is not much 
left to acuteness and strength of genius but all de 
grees of genius and intellect are brought nearly to the 
same levcjl” and he illustrates this by comparing 
his method to a pair of coinpiisses by irieans of which 
a person witlf no manual skill may draw a perfect 
circle in the same spirit he speaks of proceeding by 
dm rejectiom and appears to imagine that when we 
have obtained a collection of facts if we go on suc 
cessively rejectnig what is falsi we shall at last find 
that we have left in our liands that scientific truth 
which we seek need not observe how far this view 
is reinoved from the real state of the case the ne 
cessity of a conception which must be furnished by the 
mind in order to bind together the facts could hardly 
have escaped the eye of bacon if ho had cultivated 
more carefully the ideu side qf his own philosophy 
and any attempts which ho could have made to con 
struct such conception by mere rule and method 
must have etuled in convincing him that nothing but 
a peculiar inventive talent could supply that wliich 
was thus not contained in the facts and yet was needed 
for the discovery 

vll hvi fauitre — since bacon with all his 
acuteness had not divined circumstances so important 
in the formation of science it is not wonderful that 
his attempt to reduce this prckjcss to a technical form 
is of little value in the first place he says we 
must prepare a natural and exerimental history good 
and sufficient in the next place the instances thus 
collected are to be arranged in tables in some orderly 
way and then we must apply a legitimate and true 
induction and in his eicample he first coueots a

great number of cases in which heat appears uniler 
various circumstances which he calls muster of 
instances before the intellect” comparentia instan 
tiwrmn ad iiuellectuin or a table of oie preseifhce of 
the thing sought he then fields a table of its ab 
sence in proximate cases containing instances where 
heat doas not appear then a ible of degrees in 
which it appears with greater or less intensity he 
then adds that we must try to exclude several ob 
vious supjkwitious which ho doo ty‘ reference to some 
of the instances he has collectel and thfe step he calls 
the af’ticimve or the rejecium of natures he then 
observes and justly that wheieas truth emerges more 
cjuiily from error than from confusion we may after 
this prepaiutiijn give play to the intellect fiat vrmis 
sio iiitellectus and make an attempt at induction 
liable afterwards to lie corrected and by this ste 
which he terms his first vindemlation or inchoate 
induction he is led to the proposition concerning 
heat which we have stated above 

 ill all th details of his example ho is unfortu 
nate by proposing himself to examine at once 
into the nature of heat instead of the laws of special 
classes of pliciiomena he makes as wc have said a 
fundamental mistake which is the less suirising 
since he hal before him so few examples of the right 
couise in the previous histoiy of science but fur 
ther liis collection of instances is very loosely brought 
togetlut for he includes in his list the lut tiste of 
aromatic plants the caustic effects of acids and many 
other facts which cannot be ascribed to heat without a 
studious laxity in the use of the word and when he 
comes to that point where ho permits his intellect its 
mnge the concejition of motion upon which it at once 
fastens appears to be selected with little choice or 
skill the suggestion being taken from flame boiling 
 liquids a vilown fire and some other cases if fiom 
such examples we could imagine heat to be motion two

ought at least to have some gradatiou to oases of heat 
whore no motion is visible as in a redhot iron it 
would seem that after a large collection of instances 
had been looked at the intellect even in its first at 
teihpts ought not to have dwelt upon such an hyjk 
thesis os this 

i after these steps bacon speaks of several 
classes of instances which singling them out of the 
general and indiscriminate collection of facts he terms 
imtances with frerogamve and these he points out as 
peculiar aidsand guides to the intellect in its task 
these instances with prerogative have generally been 
much dwelt upon by those who have commented on 
the abvwwi organon yet in reality such a classifi 
cation as has been observed by one of the ablest 
wiiters of the present day is of little service in the 
task of induction for the instances are for the most 
pait classed not according to the idetis which they in 
volve or to any obvious circumstance in the facts of 
which they consist but according to the extent or 
manner of their influence upon the inquiry in which 
they are employed thus we have solitary instances 
migrating instiinces ostensive instances clandestine 
instances so termed according to the degree in which 
they exhibit or seem to exliibit the property whose 
natuie we would examine we liave guidepost in 
stances hiatantim crucial instances of the parted 
bead of the doorway of the lamp according to the 
guidance they supply to our advance such a dassi 
ficatioq is much of the same natuie as if having to 
teach the art of building we were to describe tools 
with reference to the amount and jdace of the work 
which tliey must do instead of pointing out their con 
struction and use — as if we were to iorm the pupil 
that we must have tools for lifting a stone up tools 
for moving it sideways tools for laying it square 
tools for cementing it firmly such an enumeration of 
cgids would convey little instruction aa to the raeansk

ii 

moreover many of fiiicon’s clahses of instances are 
vitiated by the assumption that the ‘‘form” that is 
the general law and cause of the property which is the 
subject of investigation is to be looked for directly in 
the instances which as we have seen in his inquiry 
concerning heat is a fuiidaiiiontal error 

 yet his phraseology in some cases aa in the 
imtantia erucis serves well to mark the plice which 
certain experiments hold in ijiir reasonings and many 
of the special examples wbicli he gives are full of 
acuteness and sagacity thus he suggelts swinging a 
pendulum in a mine in order to determine whether 
tlie attraction of tiie eahh arises fiom the attraction of 
its parts and observing the tile at the same moment 
in lifteveut parts of the world in order to ascertain 
whether the motion of the water is expansive or pro 
gressive with other ingenious proposals ths marks 
of genius may serve to counterbalance tlie unfavour 
able judgment of bacon’s aptitude foi’ physical science 
which we arc sometimes temted to fonn in conse 
quence of his false views on other points as his rejec 
tion of the copernicun system and his undervaluing 
clillert’ iiiagnotical siecilations most of these citors 
arose from a too ambitious habit of intellect which 
would not be contmited with any excejt very wide 
and general truths and from an indistinctness of 
mechanicaj and perhaps in general of mathematical 
ideas — detects which j acoii’s own philosophy was di 
rectexl to remedy and which in the progress of time 
it has remedied in others 

viii his mofo— having thus freely given 
our judgment concerning the most exact and definite 
portion of bacon’s precepts it cannot be necessaiy for 
us to discuss at any leugtli the value of those more 
vogue and geneml wmmings against jirejudice and jar 
tiality against intellectual indolence and presumption 
with wliich his works abound his advice and exhor 
tations of this kind are always expressed with energy 
and jwint often clothed in the happiest fontis of ima 
gery and hence it has come to pass lhat such pas 
sages are perhaps more familiar to the general reader

thita any other part of his writings nor are bacon’s 
counsels without their impoitance when we have to 
do with those subjects in which prejudice and ar 
tiality exercise their peculiar sway questions of ptli 
tics and morals of mauneis or history cannot 

be subjected to a scheme of idgorous induction and 
though on such matters we venture to assert geueral 
principles these are commonly obtained with some de 
gree of insecnrity and depend upon special habits of 
thougbt not upon mere logical connexion here 
therefore thointellerit may be perveited by mixing 
with the pure reason our gregarious affections or our 
individual propensities the false suggestions involved 
in language or the imposing delusions of received 
theories in these dim and complex labyrinths of 
human thouglit tjte idol of the tribe or of tjii den of 
the foruniy or of the theatre may occupy ‘men’s minds 
with delusive shapes and may obscure or pervert their 
vision of truth but in that natural philosophy with 
which we are here concerned there is little oppor 
tunity for such influences as far as a physical theory 
is completed through all the steps of a just induction 
there is a clear daylight diffused oyer it which leaves 
no lurkingplace for prejudice each part can be ex 
amined separately and repeatedly and the theory is 
not to be deemed perfect till it will bear the scrutiny 
of all sound minds alike althongli therefore bacon 
by warning men against the idols of fallacious images 
above spoken of may have guaixled them from danger 
ous error his precepts have little to do with natural 
philosophy and we cannot agree with him when he 
says that the doctrine conceining these idols bears 
the same relation to tho interpretation of nature as 
the doctrine concerning sophistical paralogisms bears 
to common logic

object with him to apply his knowledge to use the 
insight which he obtains into nature he would employ 
in commanding nature for the service of mam he 
wishes to hav not only principles but works the 
jihinse which best describes the aim of his philosophy 
is his own “ ascendeiido ad axiomafa descendendo 
ad openi this disposition appears in the first apho 
rism of the n ire am and nms tlirough the 

work man the minister and interpreter of nature 
does and understands so far as he has in fact or in 
thought observed the coumc of nature and he cannot 
know or do more tliau this” it is not necessary for 
us to dwell much upon this tiim of mind for the 
whole of onr present inquiry goes upon tins suppo 
sition that an atxjuaintance with the laws of natuie is 
worth our having for its own sake it may be uni 
versally true that knowledge is power but we have 
to do w’ith it not as power but as knowledge it is 
the formation of science not of art with which we 
are here concerned it may give a peculiar interest 
to the history of science to show how it constantly 
tends to provide better and better for the wants and 
comforts of the bidy but ilmt is not the interest 
which engages us in our present inquiry into the na 
ture and course of philosophy the consideration of 
the means wliich promote man’s material wellbeing 
often apimars to be invested with a kind of dignity by 
the discovery of general laws wliich it involves and 
the satisfjiction wliich rises in our minds at the con 
templation of such cjises men sometimes ascribe with 
a false ingenuity to the love of mere bodily enjoy 
ment but it is never difqcult to see that this baser 
and coarser element is not the real source of our ad 
miration those who hold that it is the main business 
of science to constinict instruments for the uses of ufe 
appear sometimes to be willing to accept the conse 
quence which follows from such a doctrine that the

admivatlon but those who maintam such para 
doxes often by a happy inconsistency make it their 
own aim not to devise some improved covering for the 
feet but to delight the mind witi acute speculations 
exhibited in all the graces of wit and fancy 

it hits been said that the key of the baconian 
dotrinc consists in two words utility and progress 
with regard to the latter point we have already seen 
that the hope and prosject of a iwundlest progress in 
huhijin knowledge had sprung up iu men’s minds even 
in the early thnes of fmperial rome and were most 
emphaticiilly expressed by that very seneca who dis 
dained to reckon the worth of knowledge by its value 
in food and clothing and when we say that utility 
was the great business of bacon’s philosophy we forget 
onehalf of his characteristic pluasc “ ascendcudo ad 
axiinomata” no less tlian descendeiido ad opera” was 
he repeatedly deckred the scheme of liis path he 
constantly spoke wo arc told by his secretary of two 
kinds of experiments experinmita fructifora and eacj 
jpefiimuta lucifera 

 again when we are told by modem wiiters that 
bacon merely recommended such induction as all toon 
instinctively practise we ought to recollect his own 
earnst and incessant declarations to the contrary the 
induction hitheiio piuctised is he says of ho use for 
obtaining solid science there are two ways® ‘hc 
via ill usu est” ‘‘ altem vera sod intentata” men 
have constantly been employed in anticipaiioi in illicit 
induction the intellect left to itself rushes on in this 
road® the conclusions so obtained are persuasive 
far moie persuasive than inductions made with due 
caution but still this method must be rejected if 
wo would obtain tnie knowledge we shall then at 
length have ground of good hope for science when w©

proceed in another manner we must rise not ty a 
leap but by small steps by successive advances by a 
gradation of ascents trying our facts and clearing our 
notions at every interval the scheme o true philoso 
phy according to bacon is not obvioas and simple but 
long and teclmiciil requiring constant care and serf 
deuial to follow it and we have seen that in this 
opinio his judgment is confirmed by the past history 
and present condition of science • 

again it is by no means a just view of bacon’s 
character to place him ii contrast to plkto plato’s 
philosophy wtis the philosophy of ideas but it was 
not icffc for bacon to set up the philosophy of facts in 
opposition ip that of ideas that had been done fully 
by the speculative reformers of the sixteenth centiry 
loii had the merit of showing that facts and ideas 
must le combined and not only so imt of divining 
many of the special rules and forms of tliis combinio 
tion when as yet there were no examples of them 
with a sagacity hitherto quite uuparalleled 

x ilia fersecerancii — with bacon’s un 

happy pcditical life we have here notliing to do but 
we cannot but notice with pleasure how faithfully 
how pcrseveringly how energetically he discharged 
his great philosojliical office of a reformer of aletluxls 
he had conceived the purpose of making this his ob 
ject at an early period when meditating the con 
tinuation of lus nqvuth organon and spdaking of his 
reasons for trusting that his work will reach some 
completeness of effect he says’ “i am by two argu 
ments thus persuadei first i think thus from the

it may hope the divine blessing” in stating the 
grounds of hope for future progress in the sciences he 
says® “some liopc may we conceive be ministered 
to men by our own example and this we say not for 
the sake of boasting but because it is useful to be said 
if any despond let them look at me a man among all 
others of my age most occupied with civil affairs nor 
of very sound health which brings a great loss of

the footsteps’of no nviii nor communicating on thes 
subjects with any mortal yel having steadily fintcrcd 
upon the true road knd made my mind submit to 
things themselves one who has in tliia underbiking 
made as we think some progress” he then pro 
ceeds to speak of what may be done by the combined 
and more prosperous lalours of otheis in that stmin 
of noble hope and confidimce which rises again and 
again like a chorus at intervals in every part of his 
writings in the advanceniesu of learning he had 
said “ i could not be true and constant to the argu 
ment i handle if i were not willing to go beyond 
others but yet not more willing than to liave others 
go beyond me again” in the preface to the instau 
ratio magnuy bo had placed among his postulates those 
expnssions which have more than once warmed the 
breast of a philosophical reformer® “ concerning our 
selvcs we speak not but as touching the matter which 
we liavc ill hand this wc ask — that men be of good 
hope neither feign and imagine to themselves this 
our reform as something of infinite dimension and 
beyond the grasp of mortal man when in truth it 
is the end and true limit of infinite enor and is by 
no means unmindful of the condition of moitality anij 
humanity not confiding that such a thing can be 
carried to its perfect close in the space of a single age 
but assigning it as a task to a uccession of genera

xi his hieiy — wc may add that the spint 
of piety as well as of hope which is seen in this passage 
appears to have been habitual to bacon at all periods 
of his life we find in his works several drafts of por 
tions of his great scheme and several of them begin 
with a prayer one of these entitled in the edition 
of his works “ the student’s prayer” appears to me 
to belong probably to his early youth another en 
titled “the writer’s prayer” is inserted at the end 
of the preface of the imtaiiralio as it wtxs finally pub

man by inserting here these two jrayers 

“to god the father god the word god the spirit 
wo pour forth most humble and hearty supplications 
that he remembering the calamities of mankind and 
the pilgrimage of this our life in which we wear out 
days few and evil would please to open to us new 
refreshments out of the fountains of his goodness for 
the alleviating of our miseries this also wo humbly 
and earnestly beg that human things may hot preju

natutal light anything of incredulity or intellectual 
night may arise in oiu minds towards divine mysteries 
but rather that by our mind thoroughly cleansed and 
purged from fancy and vanities and yet subject and 
perfectly given up to the divine oracles there may be 
given mto faith the things that are faith’s”

f rancis bacon and hi£ works bave recently 
been discussed and examined by various writers 
in prance and germany as well as england not to

valuable edition of his philosophical works count 
j oseph de maistre wrote a severe critique of his philo 
which has been published since the death of 
the author m charles remusat has written a lucid 
and discriminating essay on the subject and in eng 
land we have had a new edition of the works pu 
lished with a careful and thoughtful examination of 
the philosophy which they contain written by one of 
the editors a person especially fitted for such an ex 
amination by an acute intellect great acquaintance 
with philosophical literature and a wide knowledge 
of modern science robert leslie ellis the editor 
of whom speak died during the publication of the 
edition and before he had done full justice to his 
powers but he had already written various disserta 
tions on bacon’s philosophy which accompany the 
different treatises m the new edition 

mr ellis has given a more precise view than any of 
his predecessors had done of the nature of bacon’s

inductio and of his philosophy of discovoiy bacons 
object was to discover the ‘natures or eitices of 
things in order that he might reproduce these natures 
or essences at will he conceived that these natures 
were limited in number and manifested in various 
combinations in the bodies which exist in the uni 
yerae so that by accumulating observations of them 
in a multitude of cases we may learn by induction in 
what they do and in what they do not consist the n 
duction which is to be used for this purjose coniidsts 
in a great mbasure of excluding the cases which do 
not exhibit the ‘nature’ in question and by such 
exclusion duly repeated we liave at last left in our 
hands the elements of which the proposed nature con 
sists and the knowledge which is thus obtained may 
be applied to reproduce the things so analysed as 
exliibiting this view clearly we may ttike a pjtvssage in 
the sylva sylvarum “ gold has tlusc natures great 
ness of weight closeness of parts fixation pliantness or 
spftness immunity from rust colour or tincture of 
yellow therefore the sure way thuugli most alwiit to 
make gold is to know the causes of the several na 
tures before rehearsed and the axioms concerning the 
same eor if a man cim make a metal that hath all 
these properties let men dispute whether it be gold 
or no” he means tliat however they dispute it is 
gold for all practiced purposes 

for such an induction as this bacon claims the 
merit both of being certain and of being nearly inde 
pendent of the ingenuity of the inquirer it is a 
method which enables all men to make exact dis 
coveries as a pair of compasses enables all men to 
draw an exact circle 

now it is necessary for us who are exjdoring the 
progress of the true philosophy of discovery to say 
plainly that this port of bacon’s speculation is ertro 
neoua and valueless no scientific discovery ever has 
been me in this way men have not obtained truths 
concern dg the natural world by seeking for the na 
tures of thing and by extracting them from pheno 
mena by rejecting the cases in which they were not 



additional remarks on francis bacon 

on the contriry they have begun by ascertaining the 
lawb of hie phenotmna and have then gone on not 
by a mechanical method which levels all intellect but 
by special effbrts of the brightest intellects to catch 
hold of the ideas by which these laws of phenomena 
might be interpreted and expressed in inote general 
terms those two steps the finding the laws of phe 
ixoniena and finding the conceptions by which those 
laws can be expressed are really the course of dis 
covery as the hishny of science txhibits it to us 

bacon therefore according to the view now pre 
sented was wrong both as to his object and as to his 
method he was wrong in taking for his object the 
essences of things — the causes of abstract propehies 
for these man cannot or can veiy rarely discover 
and all bacon’s ingenuity in enumerating and classify 
ing these essences and abstract properties has led and 
could leal to no result the vast results of modem 
science have been obtained not by seeking and finding 
the essences of things but by exploring the laws of 
phenomena and the causes of those laws 

and bacon’s method as w’ell as his object is titlatcd 
by a pervading eitor — the enor of supposing that to be 
done by method which must be done by mind — that 
to be done by rule w’hich must be dojic by a flight 
beyond rule — that to be mainly negative which is 
eminently positive — that to depend on other men 
which must depend on the discoverer himself — that 
to be mere prose which must have a dash of poetry — 
that to be a work of mere labour which must be also 
a work of genius 

mr ellis has seen very clearly and explained very 
candidly that this method thus recommended by bacon 
lias not led to discovery it is” he says “ neither to 
the technical part of his method npr to the details of 
his view of the nature and progress of science that ms 
 gimt fiime is justly owing his merits are of another 
kind they belong to the spirit rather than to the 
positive precepts of bis philosophy” 

as the reader of the last chapter will see this 
amounts to much the same as the account which i 



 philosophy of discovert 


had gwen of the positive results of bacon’s method and 
the real value of that portion of his philosophy which 
he himself valued most but still there romam as i 
have also noted portions of bacon’s speculations which 
have a great and enduring value namely his doctrine 
that science is the interpretation of nature his dis 
tinction of this interpretation of nature from the 
vicious and premature anticipation of naiture which 
had generally prevailed till then and the recom 
mendation of a graduated and successive induction by 
which alone ‘the highest and most general truths were 
to be reached these are points which he urges with 
great cloaincss and with gi at earnestness and these 
are important points in the true ihiloscphy of dis 
covery 

 may add that mr ellis agices with me in noting 
the invention of the conception by whicli the laws of 
plieuomena are interpreted as something additional to 
inductioay both in the common and in the baconian 
sense of the word he says general pxeface art 
‘in all cases this process scientific discovery in 
volves an element to which nothing corresponds in the 
tables of comparcuce and exclusion namely the 
application to the facts of a principle of arrangement 
ail idea existing in the mind of the discoverer an 
tecedently to the act of induction” it may be said 
that this principle or idea is aimed at in the bacoman 
analysia and thk is in one sense true but it 
must be added that this analysis if it be thought 
right to call it so is of the essence of the discovery 
ihich results from it to toh for gnmted that it 
has been already eftected is simply a petitib principiu 
in most cases te mere act of induction follow as a 
matter of course as soon as the etpproprujue idea has 
been introdaoecl” and as an example he takes eep 
lerv invention of the ellipse as the idea by which 
mars’s motibns could be reduced to law making the 
same use ot tins example which we have repeatedly 
made of it 

mr ellis may at first sight appear to express him 
self more favourably than i have done witli regald to 



additional remauks on francis bacon 

the value of baconb inqaidbio m naiuram cafidi in 
the second book of the novum organon he says of 
one art of it‘ bacon here anticipates not merely 
the essential character of the most recent theory of 
heat but also the kind of evidence by which it has 
been established the merit of having perceived the 
true significance of the production of heat by friction 
belongs of right to bacon” 

but notwithstanding this mr ellis’s general judg 
ment on this specimen of baepn’s application of hia 
own method does not differ essentially from mine 
he examines the inquiaitio at sotne length and finally 
says “if it weie affirmcid that bacon after having 
had a glimpse of the truth suggested by some obvious 
phenomena had then iecourse as he himself expresses 
it to certain ‘ differeiitue inanes in order to save the 
phenomena i think it would be hard to dispute the 
truth of tlie censure” 

another of the editors of this edition mr sped 
ding fixes his attention upon another of the features 
of the method of discovery proposed by bacon and is 
disposed to think that the proposed niethod has never 
yet hod justice done it bectiuse it has not been tried 
in the way and on the scale that bacon proposes 
bacon recommended that a gieat collection of facts 
should be at once made and accumulated regarding 
every branch of human knowledge and conceived 
that when this had been done by common observers 
philosophers might extract scientific truths’ from this 
mass of fiicts by the application of a right method 
this separation of the offices of the observer and dis 
coverer mr bpedding thinks is shown to be possible 
by such practical examples as meteorological observa 
tions made by ordinary observers and reducm to 
tables and laws by a central calculator by hydrogra 
pmcal observations made by ships pxbvid with pro

and to this our reply will le in the terms which 
the history of all tlie sciences has tiiught us that such 
methods of procedure as this do not belong to the 
epoch of discovery but to the period of verificatwn 
and applicaiion of the discovery which follows when 
a theory has been estjjblislied in its general form our 
knowledge of the distribution of its phenomena in 
time and space can be much romoted by irdinary ob 
servers scattered over the earth and succeeding each 
other in time providcml they are furnished with instru 
ments and methods of observation duly constructed 
on the principles of science but such observeis can 
not hi any degree snpeisede the discoverer who is finit 
to establish ihe theory and to introduce into the facts 
a new principle of order when the laws of nature 
have been caught sight of much may be done even 
by ordinniy observers in verifying and exactly deter 
niiuing them but when a real discovery is to be made 
this sepai’ation of the observer and the theorist is not 
possible in those cases the questioning temper the 
busy suggestive mind is needed at every step to di 
rect the oiierating hand or the opeti gaze no possible 
accumulation of facts about mixture and heat collected 
in the way of blind trial could have led to the doc 
trines of chemistry or crystallography or the atomic 
theory or voltaic and chemical and magnetic polaiity 
or physiology or any other science indeed not only 
is an existing theory requisite to supply the observer 
with instruments and methods but without theory lie 
cannot even describe his observations ho says that 
ho mixes an acid and an alkali but what is an acid 
what is an alkali how does ho know them he 
classifies crystals according to their forms but till he 
has learnt what is distinctive in the form of a crystal 
he cannot distinguish a cube from a suaie prism even 
if he h a goniometer and could use it and the like 
impossibility hangs over all the other subjects to 



additional remarks on francis bacon 


report facts for scientific purposes without some aid 
from theory is not only useless but impossibc 

when mr spedding says “ i could wish that men 
of science would apply themselves earnestly to the 
solution of this practical problem what measures 
are to bo taken in order that the greatest variety of 
judicious observations of nature all over the world 
may bo carried on in concert uian a common pllin and 
biought to a common centre’ — he is urging upon men 
of science to do what they have always done so fiir as 
they have had any power and in proportion as the 
state of science rendered such a procedure possible and 
profitable to science in astronomy it has been done 
from the times of the greeks and even of the chal 
deans having been begun as soon as the heavens were 
reduced to law at all in meteorology it has been 
done extensively tbough to little purpose because the 
weather has not yet been reduced to rule m en of sci 
ence have shown how barometers thermometers hy 
grometers and the like may be constructed and those 
may bo now reid by any one as easily as a clocks but 
of ten thousand meteorological registers thus kept by 
ordinary observers what good lias come to scienco 
again the laws of the tides have been in a great 
measure determined by observations in all parts of the 
globe theory jointed out what was to be ob 

served in like manner the facts of terrestrial mag 
netism were ascertained with tolerable eomplcteness 
by extended observations and then only when a 
most iecondite and profound branch of mathematics 
had jiointed out what was to be observed and most 
ingenious instruments hal been devised by men of 
science fgr observing and even witli these it re 
quires an educatmn to use the instruments but in 
many cases no education in the use of instruiuents de 
vised by others can supersede the necessity of n theo 
rotical and suggestive spirit in the inquirer himself 
he must devise lils own instruments and his own me 
thods if ho is to make discovery ‘what chomist 
or inquirer about polarities or about optical laws yet 
undiscovered can make any progress by using another 



 phhosopht op discovert 

mans experiments and observations he must invent 
at every step of bis observation and the observer and 
theorist can no more be dissevered than the body and 
soul of the inquirer 

that persons of moderate philosophical powers may 
when duly educated make observations which may 
used by greater discoverera than themselves is true 
we have examples of such a subordination of scientific 
offices in astronomy in geology and in many other 
departments but still as i liave said a very con 
siderable degioe of scientific education is needed even 
for the subordinate labourers in science and tlie more 
considerable in proportion as science advances further 
and further since every advance implies a knowledge 
of what has already been done and requires a new 
precision or generality in the new points of inquiry

fuom bacon to xewton 


i harvey — we liavo already seen tliai bacon 
was by no moans tlie first mover or principal author of 
the revolution in the method of philosophizing which 
took plice in his time but only the writer who pro 
clainied in the most impressive and comprehensive 
manner the scheme the profit the dignity and the 
proaiects of the new philosojhy those therefore 
who after him took up tho same views are not to be 
considered as his successors but as his felhwlabourcrvs 
and the line of histoiical succession of opinions must 
be ijuiwed without special reference to any one lead 
ing character as tho principal figure of the epoch i 
resume this line by noticing a contemporary and 
fellowcountryman of bacon ilarvey the discoverer of 
the circulation of the blood this discovery was not 
published and generally accepted till near the end of 
bacon’s life but tlie anatomist’s reflections on the 
method of pursuing science though strongly maiked

oellor’s haiwey was a pupil of fabrioius of acqua 
pendente whom we noticed among the practical re 
formers of tho sixteenth century he entetlmiied 
like his master a strong reverence for the great name 
which had ruled in philosophy up to that time aris 
totle and galen and was disposed rather to recoi 
mend his owm method by exhibiting it as the true 
interpretation of ancient wisdom than to boast of its 
novelty it is true that he assigns as his reason for

publidiing some of his researches ‘‘that by revealing 
the method i use in searching into things i might 
propose to studious men a new and if i mistake not 
a surer path to the attainment of knowledge” but 
he soon proceeds to fortify himself with the authority 
of aristotle in doing this however he has the very 
great merit of giving a living and practical character 
to truths which exist in the aristotelian works but 
which liad hitherto been barren and empty professions 
we have seen that aristotle had asserted the im 
poitance of eperieiicj as one root of knowledge and 
in this had been fallowed by the schoolmen of the 
middle ages but this assertion came with very dif 
ferent force and effect fiom a man the wliole of whose 
life had been spent in obtaining by means of expe 
rience knowledge which no man had possessed before 
ill harves general reflections the necessity ofboth 
the elements of knowledge sensations and ideas ex 
perience and rtsason is fully brought into view and 
rightly connected with the metaphysics of aristotle 
he puts the antithesis of these two elements with

great clearness itniversals are chieilj known to us 
for science is begot by reasoning from universajs to 
xiarticulars yet that very comprehension of universals 
in the uudej’standing springs from sthe perception of 
singulars in oui sense again he quotes aristotle’s 
aiparently opposite asseitions — that made in his 
sic ‘that we must advance from things which are 
first known to us though confusfidly to things more 
distinctly intelligible in themselves from the wliole 
to the pait from the univemil to the particular” 
and tliat made in the a mdytlcs that siiigulais are 
more known to us and do fiist exist according to 
sense for nothing is in the iinderstiinding which was 
not before in the sense” both he says aio true 
thougli at first they seem to clash for “ thougli in 
knowledge we begin with seiise sensation itself is a 
uiiiveiml thing this he further illustrates and 
quotes senecji who says tlnit “art itself is nothing 
but the rmsoi of the work implanted in tlie artists 
mind and tulds “ the same w’ay by which wc gain 
an ait by the very same vay wo attain any kiml of 
science or km w ledge whatever for as art is a habit 
wlioso object is sometliiiig to be done so science is a 
habit whose object is something to be known and as 
the former proceedeth from the imitation of examples 
so this latter from tlie knowdedgo of things natural 
the source of both is from sense and experience since 
but it is impossible that ait sliould be nghtly pur 
chased by the one or science by the other without 
a diiection ffom ideas” without here dwelling on 
the relation of art and science very justly stat by 
haiwey except that ideas exist in a very difieront 
form in the mind of the artist and the scientist it will 
be seen that this doctrine of science springing from 
exierience with a direction from ideas is exactly that 
which we have repeatedly urged as the true view of 
the subject from this view harvey proceeds io infer

subject not only for first discovering but for teodring

natural knowledge without experimental skill in ana 
tomy he will no better apprehend what i shdl deliver 
concerning generation than a man bom blind can

get a humid and floating opinion but never a solid 
and infallible knowledge as is happenable to those 
who see foieigfi count a es only in maps and the bowels 
of men falsely described in anatomical tables and 
hence it comes about that in tins rank age we have 
iminy sophisters and bookwrights but few wise men 
and philosophers” he had before declared “how 
unsafe and degenerate a thing it is to bo tutored by 
other men’s commentaries without making trial of the 
things themselves osjiecially since nature’s book is 
so open and legible” we are here reminded of gali 
leo’s condemnation of the pafer philosophers” the 
train of thought thus expressed by the practical dis 
coverers spread rapidly with the spreml of the new 
knowledge that had suggested it and soon became 
general and unquestioned 

 descartes — such opinions are now among the 
most familial and jkpular of those which are current 
among writers and seakers but wc should eit much 
if we were to imagine that after they were once pro 
pounded they were never resisted or contradicted in 
deed even in our own time not only are such maxims 
vetjr often practically neglected or forgotten but 
the opposite opinions and views of science quite in 
consistent with those we have been explaining are 
often promulgated and widely accepted thephiloso

we speak the former philosophy no less than the 
latter had its gieat asserter and exioundef a man in

minds to a new activity of inquiry i speak of des 
carter whose labonrisi considered as a philosophical 
system were an endivour to revive the method of 
obtaining knowledge by reasoning from onr own ideas 
only and to erect it in opposition to the method of 
observation and experiment the cartesian philoso 
phy contained an attempt at a counterrevolution 
thus in this author’s principia philosophioi he says’ 
that “he will give a short account of the principal 
phenomena of tlie world not that lie may use them as 
reasons to juove anything for adds he “we desire 
to deduce effects from causes not causes from effects 
but only in order that out of the innumerable eflects 
which wc loam to bo capable of resulting from tlie 
same causes we may determine our mind to consider 
some rather than others” lie had before said “ the 
principles which we have obtained by pure d priori 
reasoning arc so vast and so fruitful that many more 
consfqucnces follow from them than wc sej contained 
in this visible world and oven many more than our 
mind can ever take a fall survey of” and be pro 
fesses to apply this method in detail thus in at 
tempting to state the three ftindainental laws of mo 
tion ho employs only d reasonings and is in 

fact led into error in the third law which he thus ob 
tains and in his dioptrics’’ he pretends to deduce 
the laws of reflection and rcfnictmn of light from cer 
tain comparisons which are in truth arbitrary in 
which the radiation of light is iepreseiited by the mo 
tion of a ball impinging upon the reflecting or refract 
ing body it might he rejiresentcd as a curious in 
stance of the caprice of fortune which appeals in sci 
entiflo as in other history that kepler professing to 
derive all his knowledge from experience and exert 
ing himself with the greatest energy and perseverance 
failed in detecting the law of reftaction while des 
cartes who professed to be able to despise experiment 
obtained the true law of sines but as wc have stated 


 t’ftraiuiks qjrifrntslkvlcil cspll

 philosophy op discovery 

in the ilitory descartes appears to have leamt this 
law from snells papers and whether this be so or 
not it is certain that notwithstanding the profession of 
independence which his philosophy made it was in 
reality constantly guided and instnicted by experience 
thus in explaining the rainbow in which his portion 
of the discovery merits great praise he speaks® of 
taking a globe of glass allowing the sun to shine on 
one side of it and noting the colours produced by rays 
after two refractions qnd one reflection and in many 
other instances indeed in all that relates to jaysics 
the reasonings and explanations of descaites and his 
followers were consciously or unconsciously directed 
by the known facts which they had observed them 
selves or learnt from others 

but since descartes thus speculatively at least set 
himself in ojposition to the great reform of scientifle 
method which was going on in his time how it may 
be asked did he acquire so strong an infiiience over 
the most active minds of his time how is it that he 
became the founder of a large and distinguislied school 
of philosohoi’s how is it that he not only was 
mainly instrumental in deposing aristotle from his in 
tellectual thrrme but for a time appeared to have esta 
blished himself with almost equal powers and to have 
rendered the cartesian school as firm a body as the 
perijiatctic liad been 

the causes to be assigned for this l emarkablo result 
are i conceive the following in the first place the 
phicists of the cartesian school did as i have just 
stated found their philosophy upon experiment and 
did not practically or indeed most of them theo 
retically assent to tlieir masters boast of siiowing 
what the phenomena must instead of looking to s 
what they are and as dfcartes had really incotjk 
rated in his philosophy all the chief physical disco 
veries of bis own and preceding times and had de 
kvered in a more general and systematic shape than 




 jiseurumt c vul p tsf 




from bacon to newton 

any one before him the principles which he thus esta 
blished the physical philosophy of his school was in 
reality far the best then cunent and was an immense 
improvement upon the aristotelian doctrines which 
had not yet been displaced as a sjstem another cir 
cumstance which gained him much favour was the 
bold and ostentatious manner in which he pixifessed 
to begin his philosophy by liberating hinpelf from all 
preconceived ircjudice the first sentence of his phi 
losophy coritiiina this celebrated declaratioii “since” 
ho says “ wo begin life as infants and have contracted 
various judgments concerning sensible tilings before 
we possess the entire use of our reason we are turned 
aside from the knowledge of truth by many prejudices 
fioin which it does not ajipcai that we can be any 
otherwise delivered than if once in our life wo make 
it our business to doubt of everything in which we 
discern the smallest suspicion of uncertainty” in the 
face of this sweeping rejection or unhesitating scrutiny 
of all preconceived opinions the power of the ancient 
authorities and masters in philosophy must obviously 
shrink away and thus descartes came to be con 
sidered as the gicjit hero of the overthrow of the aris 
totelian dogmatism but in addition to these causes 
and perhaps more powerful than all in procuring tho 
assent of men to bis doctrines came tho deductive and 
systeniatic chanicter of his philosophy for although 
all knowledge of tho external world is in resility only 
to be obtained from observation by inductive steps — 
minute slow and many as galileo and 

bacon had already taught — the human mind conforms 
to these conditions reluctantly suid unsteadily and is 
over ready to rush to general principles and then to 
employ itself ai deducing conclusions from these by 
synthetical reasonings a task grateful from the dis 
tinctness and certainty of the result and the accom 
• panying feeling of our own stciency hence men 
readily overlooked the precarious character of des 
cartes fundamental assumjtions in their admiration 
of the skill with which a varied and complex universe 
was evolved out of them and the complete and

systematic chaiacter of this philosophy attracted meu 
no jess tlian its logical connexion i may quote here 
what a philosojher“ of our own time has said of another 
writer “ho owed liis influence to various causes at 
the head of which may be jdaced that genius for sys 
tem whicli though it cramps the growth of know 
ledge perhaps anally atones for that mischief by the 
zeal and activity which it rouses among followers and 
opponents who discover truth by acciilent wlien in 
pursuit of weppous fop their warfare a system which 
attempts a task so hard iis that of subjecting viist pro 
vinces of human knowledge to one or tro principles 
if it presents some striking instances of conformity to 
superficial appearances is sure to delight the framer 
and for a time to subdue and captivate the student too 
entirely for sober reflection and rigorous examination 
in the first instance consistency passes for truth v hen 
principles in some instances have proved suflicient to 
give atl unexpected explanation of facts the delighted 
reader is content to accept m true all otlicr deductions 
from the principles specious premises being assumed 
to bo true nothing more can be required than logical 
inference mathematical forms pjiss current an the 
equivalent of mathematicfal ccrfciinty the unwary 
admirer is sfitisfied with the coiaplctcness and sym 
metry of the plan of his house unmindful of the need 
of examining the firmness of the foundation and the 
soundness of the materials the systemmaker like 
the conqueior long dazzles and overawes the world 
but when their sway is psist the vulgar herd unable 
to measure their astonisliiug faculties take revenge 
by trampling on fallen gieatiiess” bacon showed 
his wisdom in his reflections on this subject when 
he said that “method carrying a show of total and 
perfect knowledge liath a tendency to generate ac 
quiescence” 

the main value of descartes’ physical doctrines 
consisted in their being arrived at in a way inodii

sistent ¦witt his own professed method namely by a 
reference to observation but though he did in reality 
begin from facts his system was nevertheless a glaring 
example of that error which biicon had called anti 
cipatum tliat illicit generabzation which leaps at once 
from special facts to princijdes of the widest and 
remotest kiudj such for instance as the cartesian 
tloctrine that the world is an absolute plenum evtjry 
part being full of matter of some kind and that all 
natural eifccts depend on the laws of motion against 
this liiult to wluch the human mind is sd prone bacon 
had lifted ids waridng voice in vain so far as the 
caitesians were concerned as indeed to this day one 
theorist after another pursues his course and turns 
a deaf ear to the verulairiian injunctions pcrliaps 
even comlacently boasts that he founds his theory 
upon observation and forgets that there are as the 
aphorism of the noimm organon declares two ways 
by which this may be done — the one hitherto in 
use and suggested by our common tendencies but 
barren and worthless the other almost untried to 
bo puisucd only with effort and selfdeniiu but alone 
capable of pixducing true knowledge 

 gassendi — thus the lessons which bacon 
taught were far from being generally accepted and 
applied at first the amoimt of the influence of these 
two men bacon and descartes upon their age has 
often been a subject of discussion the fortunes of 
the cartcsian school have been in some measure traced 
in the history of science but i may mention the 
notice taken of these two philosophers by gassendi 
a contemporaiy and countryman of descartes gas 
sendi as i have elsewhere stated was associated with 
descartes in public opinion os an opponent of the 
aristotelian dogmatism j but was not in fact a follower 
or profound admirer of that writer in a treatise 
 on logic gassendi gives an account of the logic of 
varioua sects and authors treating in order of the

logic of zeno the eleatic of euclis the megarean 
of plato of aristotle of the stoics of epictims of 
lullius of bamus and to these he adds the lojic 
of veulam and the logic of cartesius “we must 
not” he says “on account of the celebrity it has 
obtained pass over the organon or logic of francis 
bacon lord verukm high chancellor of england 
whose noble purpose in our time it has been to make 
an instauration of the sciences” he then gives a 
brief account of the novum organon noticing the prin 
cipal features ib its rules and especially the distinction 
between the vulgar induction whicli leaps at once from 
paiticulaf experiments to the more gcnei’al axioms 
and the chastised and gradual induction which the 
author of the organon recommends in his account 
of the cartesian logic he justly observes that “ he 
too imitated verulam in this that being about to build 
uj a new philosoihy from the foundation he wished 
in the first place to lay aside all prejudice and 
having then found some solid principle to make that 
the groundwqrk of his whole structure but he pro 
ceeds by a very different path from that which veru 
lam follows for while verulam seeks aid from thbigs 
to perfect the cogitation of the intellect cartesius con 
ceives that when we have laid aside all knowledge of 
things there is in our thoughts alone such a resource 
that the intellect may by its own power arrive at a per 
fect knowledge of all even the most abstruse things 
the writings of descartes have been most admired

who have employed themselves upon metaphysical ra 
ther than physical subjects of inquiiy perhaps we 
might say that in reference to such subjects this 
method is not so vicious as at first when contrasted 
with the baconian induction it seems to be for it 
might be urged that the thoughis from which descartes 
begins ms reasonings are in reality experimenta of the 
kind which the subject requires us to consider each 
such thought is a t in the intellectual world and 
of such facts the metaphysician seeks to discover the 
laws i shall not here examine the validity of iim 



prom bacon to newton 

plea but shall turn to the consideration of the actual 
progress of physical science and its effect on men’s 
minds 

 actual progresa in science — the practiciil dis 
coverers were indeed very active and very successful 
during the seventeenth century which opened witli 
bacon’s suiwcy and exhortations the laws of nature 
of which men had begun to obtain a glimpse in the 
preceding century were investigated with zeal and 
sagacity and the consequence was that the foundations 
of most of the modern physical scieubes were laid 
that mode of research by experiment and observation 
which had a little time ago been a strange and to 
many an unwelcome innovation was now become the 
habitual cfurse of philosophera the revolution from 
the philosophy of tradition to the philosophy of ex 
perience was completed the gieat discoveries of kep 
ler belonged to the jreceding century they are not 
i believe noticed either by bacon or by descartes 
but they gave a strong impulse to astronomical and 
mecluvuical spocidators by showing the necessity of a 
sound science of motion such a science galileo had 
already begun to construct at the time of which i 
speak his disciples® were still labouring at this task 
and at other problems which rapidly suggested them 
selves they had already convinced themselves that 
air had weight in torricelli proveil this piacti 
cally by the invention of the barometer in 
cal proved it still further by sending the barometer to 
the top of a mountain pascal and boyle brought into 
clear view the fundamental laws of fluid equilibrium 
boyle and mariotte determined the law of the com 
pression of air as regulated by its elasticity otto 
guericke invented the airpump and by his “ madge 
burg experiments” ou a vacuum illustrated still fur 
ther the effects of the air guericke pursued what 
gilbert had begun the observation of electrical pheno

tnena qbl thjese two physicists made an important 
step by detecting rcptcm as well as attraction in 
these phenomena gilbert had already laid the foundar 
tions pf the science of magnetism the law of refrac 
tion at which kepler laboured in vain was as 
we have seen discovered by snell about and 
published by descartes merseune had discovered 
some of the more important pirts of the theory of 
harmonics in sciences of a different kind the same 
movement was visible chemical doctrines tended to 
assume a propfer degree of generality when sylvius in 
 tiiught the opposition of acid and alkali and 
stahl soon after the phlogistic theory of combustion

resumed the attempt to form a systematic botany 
which had been interrupted for a liundred years from 
the time of the memorable essay of otesalpinus the 
grand discoveiy of the circulation of the blood by 
ilarvey about was mlowed in by pecueffb 
discovery of the courae of the chyle there could now 
no longer be any question whether science wob pro 
gressive or whether observation could lead to new 
truths 

among these cultivators of science sucli sentiments 
as have been already quoted became very familiar 
that knowledge is to be sought from nature horself by 
observation and experiment — that in such matters 
tradition is of no force when opposed to experience 
and that more reasonings without facts cannot lead to 
solid knowledge but do not know tliat we find in 
these writers any more special rules of induction and 
scientific research which have since been confirmed 
and universally adopted perhaps too as was natuml 
in so great a revolution the writers of this time espe 
cially the secondrate ones were somewhat too prone 
to disparage the labours and talents of aristotle and 
the ancients in general and to overlook the ideal 
element of our imoiviodge in thexr zealous study of

that regards science and the supreme and sole im

 otto guericke cc — i need not illustrate these 
characteristics at any great length i may os an ex

mnta magiiebnrgica he quotes a iiassaga 
from kircher’s treatise on tho magnetic art in which 
the author says “hence it ajqiears how all philosophy 
except it be suiported by experiments is empty m 
lacious and useless what monstrosities philosophers 
in other respects of the highest and subtlest genius 
may produce in philosojdiy by neglecting experiment 
thus experience alone is tho dissolver of doubts the 
keconciler of difficulties the sole mistress of truth 
who holds a torch befire us in obscurity unties our 
knots teaches us the true causes of things” guericke 
himself reiterat the same imnark adding tliat “ plii 
losophors insisting uon their own thoughts and argu 
ments merely cannot come to any sound conclusion

were the cartesians slow in taking up the same tiain 
of reflection thus gilbert clark who in a pub 
lished a defence of descartes’ doctrine of a phnum 
in tiie universe speaks in a tone which reminds us 
of bacon and indeed was very probably caught from 
him “natural philosophy foraierly consisted entirely 
of loose and moat doubtful controversies carried on in 
highsounding words fit rather to delude than to in

philosophy of disoovbey 


there shone forth some moie divine intdieots who 
taking as their counsellors reason and expeiience to 
gether exhibited a new method of philosophizing 
hence has been conceived a strong hope that philoso 
phers may embrace not a shadow or empty image of 
truth but truth henself and that physiology physics 
scattering these controversies to the winds will con 
tract an liance with mathematics yet this is hardly 
the work of one ago still less of one man yet let 
not the mind desponc or doubt not that one party of 
investigators j’ter anjther following the same method 
of philosoihizing at last under good auguries the 
mysteries of nature being daily unlocked as far as 
human feebleness will allow tnith may at last appear 
in full and these nuptial torches may he lighted’ 

as another instance of the same kind i may quote 
the prefice to the first volume of the transactions 
of the academy of sciences at paris “it is only 
since tlie jiresent centuiy” says the writer “ that we 
can reckon the revival of mathematics and physics 
m descartes and other great men have laboured at 
this work with so much success that in this depart 
ment of literature the whole face of things has been 
changed men have quitted a sterile system of physics 
which for sweral genenitioiis had been always at the 
same point the reign of words and iins is passed 
men will have things they establish principles which 
they understand they follow those principles and 
thus they make progress authority has ceased to 
have more weight tlian reason that which was ie 
ceived without contradiction because it had been long 
received is now examined and often rejected and 
pliilosophers liave made it their business to consult 
respecting natural things nature herself rather than 
the ancients” these had now become the common 
places of those who spoke oonceming the course and 
method of the sciences 

• hooke — jelngland as might be expected the 
influence of francis bacon was more curectly visible 
we find many writers about this titfie reputing the 
truths which bacon had proclaimed and in abmiet 



paom bacon to newton 

every case showing ihe same imperfections in their 
views which we have noticed in him we may take 
as an example of this hooke’s essay enlatl 
general scheme or idea of the prnt state of natuial 
philosophy and how its defects may be remedied by a 
methodical proceeding in the making experiments and 
collecting observations whereby to compile a natural 
history as a solid basis for the superstructure of 
true philosophy” this essay may bo looked upon as 
an attempt to adapt the novum orgemon to the age 
wliich succeeded its publication we have in this 
imitation as in the original an eniimemtion of vari 
ous mistakes and impediments which had in preceding 
times prevented the progiess of knowledge exhorta 
tions to experiment and observation as the only solid 
basis of science very ingenious suggestions of trains of 
inquiry and modes of puisuing them and a promise 
of obtaining scientific truths when facts have been 
duly accumulated this last part of his scheme the 
author calls a hiilosophical algebra and he appeals 
to have imagined that it might answer the purpose of 
finding unknown causes from known facts by means 
of certain regular processes in the same manner as 
common algebra finds unknown from known quanti 
titss but this art of the plan appears to have re 
xnaiued unexecuted the suggestion of such a method 
was a result of the baconian notion that invention 
in a discoverer might be dispensed with we find 
hooke adopting the phrases in which this notion is 
impliel thus he speaks of the understanding as “being 
very prone to run into the affirmative way of judging 
and wanting patience to follow and prosecute the nega 
tive way of inquiiy by rejection of disagreeing natures 
and he follows bacon also in the error of attianpting 
at once to obtain from the facts the discovery of a 
nature” instead of investigating fitrst tlie measiues 
and the laws of phenomena i return to more general 
notices of the course of in’s thoughts on„tfais subject 

 royal society — those who associated them 
selves together for the prosecution of science quoted 
bacon as eir leader and exulted m the progress 



 philosophy op discovjby 

made by the philosophy which proceeded upon his 
principles thus in oldenburgs dedication of the 
transaction of the royal society of london for 
to robeit boyle he says “i am informed by such 
as well remember the best and worst days of the 
famous lrd bacon that though h wrote his ad 
vancemem of learning and his imtauratio magna in 
the time of his greatest power yet his grejiteat re 
putation rebounded first from the most intelligent 
foreigners in many p£ts of christeinlom and after 
speaking of his pmctical talents and his public em 
jdoyments he adds ‘‘ much more justly still may we 
wonder how without any great skill in chemistry 
without much pretence to the mathematics or me 
chanics without optic aids or other engines of late 
invention he should so much tianscend the philoso 
pheis then living in judicious and clear instructions 
in so many useful observations and discoveries i think 
i may say beyond the records of many ages” and 
in the end of the preface to the same volume he 
speaks with great exultation of the advance of scieuco 
all over europe refening undoubtedly to facts then 
familiar ‘aud now let envy snarl it cannot stop 
the wheels of active philosophy in no part of the 
known world— not in france either in paris or in 
coen — not in italy cither in rome naples milan 
florence venice lnonia or padua — in none of the 
universities either on this or on that side of the seas 
madrid lisbon all the best spirits in spain and 

portugal the spacious and remote dominions to 
them belonging — the imperial court and the princes 
of germany the northern kings and their best lumi 
naries and even the frozen muscovite and russian 
have all taken the operative ferment and it works 
high and every way to the encouragemeiit 

of all since lovers of knowledge and virtue” 

again in the prelhee ibr he pursues the 
same thought into detail we must grant that in 
the last ag when ooeindive philosophy began ta re 
eoyer ground and tb on the hs of triumphant 
philology j emorgent ventures and groat sucoessea

erected a school of atheism because ho gave counte 
nance to chemistiy to practical arts and to curious

of them into a college and queen elizabeth’s gilbert 
was a long time esteemed extiavagant for his magnet 
isms and harvey for his diligent resdhrehes in pur 
suance of the circulation of the vilool but when our 
renowned lord bacon had demonstrated the methods 
for a perfect rcatoitition of all parts of real knowledge 
and the geneious and philosophical pciveskius had 
soon after iigitatod in all parts to redeem the most 
instructive antiquities and to excite experimenkil 
essays and fresh discoveries the success became on a 
sudden stupendous and effective philosophy began to 
sparkle and even to flow into beams of shining light 
all over the world’ 

the formation of the boyal society of london and 
of the academy of sciences of paz’is from which pro 
ceeded the declamations just quoted were among many 
indications belonging to this period of tlu imjwrtance 
which stiites as well as individuals had by this time 
begun to attach to the cultivation of science the 
english society was established almost immediately 
when the restoration of the monarchy appeared to 
give a promise of tranquillity to the nation in 
and the french academy very soon afterwards in 
 tliese measures were very soon followed by 
the establishment of the observatories of pans and 
greenwich in and ifljs vrhioh may be con 
sidered to be a kind of public recognition of the astro

man whicli the cultivation of experimental philosophy 
seemed to promise it was natural that they should 
think of devising institutions and associations hy which 
such benefits might be secured bacon had drawn a 
picture of a society organized with a view to such pur 
pose in his fiction of the “ new atalantis” flie 
imaginary teacher who explains this institution to the 
incpiiring traveller describes it by the name of solo 
mona uouae and aaya “the end of our founda 
tion is the knowledge of causes and secret motions of 
things and the enlarging the bounds of the human 
crajire to oftecting of things possible” and as paits 
of this house he describes caves and wells chiunbcrs 
and towers lathh and gardens parks and pools dis 
pensatorich and furnjiccs and many other contiivances 

 provided for the purpose of making experiments of 
many kinds he describes also the various employ 
ments of the fellows of this college who bike a share 
in its researches there are nerchaiua of lights who 
bring books and inventioiis from foreign countries 
depredalora who gather the experiments which exist 
in books myaiery man who collect the experiments of 
the mechanical ajiis pioneera or mwera who invent 
now experiments and compuera who draw the ex 
periments of the former into titles and tables to give 
the bettor light for the drawing of observations and 
axioms out of them” there are also domrymm or 
henefactorsy that cast about how to draw out of the 
experiments of their fellows things of use and prao 
tice for man’s life lamvpay that diieot new experiments 
of a more penetrating liglit than the former in 
oculaioraf tliat execute the exfietimeuts so directed 
finally there are the interpreters of naturey that raise 
the former discoveries by experiments into greater ob 
servations that k more gentod truths axioms and 
ajhorisms upon this scheme we may remark that 
fictitious as it undisguisedly is it still serves to exhibit 
very clearly some of the main features of the authors 


 bacon’s ftoi ks vol tl iiw 




from bacon to newton 


 


philosophy — namely his steady view of the necessity 
of ascending from facts to the most general tmtlis by 
several stages — an exaggerated opinion of the aid that 
could bo derived in such a tash from technical sepa 
ration of the phenomena and a distribution of them 
into tables — a belief pi’obably inconect that the 
cilices of experimenter and interpreter may be entirely 
separated and ijursued by different persons with a 
certainty of obtaining success — and a strong determi 
nation to make knowledge constantly subservient to 
the uses of life 

 cowley — another project of the same kind 
less ambitious but apparently more directed to prac 
tice was published a little later by another 
eminent man of letters in this countiy i speak of 
cowley’s “ proposition for the advancement of experi 
mental philosophy’’ he suggests that a college should 
be established at a short distance from tjondon on 
dowetl with a revenue of four thousand pounds and 
consisting of twenty professors with other membeis 
the objects of the laboui’s of these professors he de 
scribes to be first to examine all knowledge of nature 
delivered to us from former ages and to pionounce it 
sound or worthless second to recover the lost inven 
tions of the ancients third to improve all arts that 
wo now have lastly to discover others tbit we yet 
have not in this propossil we cannot help marking 
the visible declension from bacon’s more philosophical 
view for we have here only a very vague indication 
of improving old arts and discovering’ new instead of 
the two clear vendamiau antitheses experiments and 
axioms deduced from them on the one hand and on 
the other an ascent to general laws and a derivation 
from these of arts for daily use moreover the pro 
mineixt place which cowley has assigned to the verify 
ing the knowledge of former ages and recovering fee 
lost inventions and drowned lands of the ancits’ 
implies a disposition to think too highly pf traditionary 
knowledge a weakness which bacon’s scheme shows 
hxm to have fully overcome and thus it hits been up 
to the present day that with all bacon’s mistakes in 



 philosophy op discovbet 

 

the philosophy of scientific method few have comeup 
to him and perhaps none have gone beyond him 

cowley exerted himself to do justice to the new 
philosophy in verse as well as prose and his poem to 
the kfysd society expresses in a very noble manner 
thos views of the history and prospects of philosophy 
which prevailed among the men by whom the boyal 
society was founded the fertility and ingenuity of 
comparison which characterize cowley’s poetry are 
well known and these qualities art in this instance 
largely employed for aic enibollishment of his subject 
many of the comparisons which he exhibits are apt 
anil striking riiilosophy is a ward whose estate hu 
man knowledge is in his nonage kept from him by 
his guardians and tutors a case which tht ancient 
rhetoricians were fond of taking as a subject of dccia 
luation and these wrongdoers retain him in unjust

 trhore were still at this time some who sneered at or

opinion was soon strongly in its favour have else 
where® noticed a nisquinade of the poet boileau in 
 directed against the aristotelians at this time 
and indeed for long afterwards the philosophers of 
i’ranc© were cartesians the english men of science 
although partially and for a time they accepted some 
of descartes’ opinions for the most ptirt carried on 
the reform independently ond pi pursuance of their 
own views and they very soon found amuch greater 
header than descartes to place at their head and to 
take as tlioir aiithority so far as they acknowledged 
authority in their speculations t speak of newton 
whose influence upon the philosophy of science i must 
now consider 

barrow — i will however fiist mention one other 
writer who may in more than one way he regarded 
as the predecessor of newton t speak of isinic bar 
row whom newtxn succeeded as professor of mathe 
matics in the university of cambridge ami wdio in hia 
mathematical specnlations approached very near to 
n ewton’a method of fluxion a he afterwards in 
became master of trinity college which office he held 
till his death in but the passages which i 
shall quote belong to an earlier period when barrow 
was about years old and may be regarcled as ex 
iressions of the opinion which were then current 
among activeminded and studious young men they 
manifest a complete familiarity with the writings both 
of bacon and of descartes and a very just appreciation 
of both the discourse of which i speak is au aca

certainly never took any hold of cambridge by hho 
cartesian hypotliesis barrow means tho doctrine that 
all the phenomena of nature can be accounted for by 
matter and motion and allowing that the motions of 
the planets are to be so accounted for which is new 
tonian aa well as cartesian doctrine he denies that 
the oiirtesian hypothesis accounts for “ the generations 
properties and specific ojmiratioiis of animals plants 
tiiiuorals stones and other natural bodies” in doing 
which he shows a sound philosophical judgment but 
among the paits of this discourse most bearing on our 
present purpose are those where ho mentions bacon 
“against cartesius” he says “ pit the chymists and 
others but esecially as the foiemost champion of this 
battle our venilam a man of groat name and of great 
judgment who condemned this philosohy before it 
wiis born” “he” adds barrow “seveiul times iu his 
organout warned men agiiinst all liypothcses of this 
kind and noticed ladbrehaiid that there was not much 
to be expected from those principles which are brought 
into being by violent efforts of argumentation from the 
brains of jarticiilar men for that as uon the pheno 
mena of the stax’s various constructions of the lieavena 
may be devised so also upon the phenomena of the 
universe still more dogmas may be founded and con 
structed and yet all sucli arc mere inventions and as 
many pliilasohics of this kind as arc or shall be ex 
tant so many fictitious and theatrical worlds are made’ 
the reference is doubtless ia phorism lxii of the liist 
bxk of the novum organon iu which bacon is 
speaking of his “ idols of the theatre” after making 
the remju’k whicli bariow has adopted bacon adds 
“ such theatrical fables have also this in common with 
tliose of dramatic poets that tho dnimatio story is 
more regular and elegant than truo histories are and 
is made so as to be agreeable” barrow having this 
in his mind goes on to say “and though curtesius 
jias diiissed up the stage of his theatre more prettiljf 
than any other person and made his drama more like 
history still he is not exempt from the like censure” 
and he then refers to cartesius’s own declaration that 



from bacon to newton 


 

he did not leam his system from things themselves 
bat tried to impose his own laws upon thgs thus in 
veiting the order of true philosophy 

other parts of bacoii’s wsl‘k to which barrow refers 
are those where he speaks of the form or fonnal 
cause of a body and says that in comparisori with 
that the lifficient cause and the material cause are 
things xin important and superficial and con tribute 
little to true and active science and again his 
classification of the various kinds of motions’ — the 
tiiotus libertatis motus nexus motus •continnitatis 
inotus ad lucrum fuga nnionis cougregatioiiis and 
the explanation of electrical attraction about wjiich 
gilbert and otliei’s had written as moiiis ad lucrnrn 

those pjissages show that barrow had read the 
jnovvn organon in a cpreful and intelligent manner 
and presumed liis cambrilge hearers to he acquainted 
with the work nor is lils judgment of doscartes 
icas wise and philosophical he rejects its we have 
soon his system as a tnie scheme of the universe and 
iondeinns altogether lils d prion mode of philosophiz 
ing but this dues not prevent his accepting iesarte 
real discoveries and admiring the boldness and vigour 
of his attempts to reform jdiilusophy there is in 
ihirrow’s works academic verse sis well as jrosc on 
the subject of the caitesiaii hypothesis in this des 
cartes iiiinself is highly pmised tliough his doctrines 
are very partially accepted the writer siiys “par

don wo follow you inquiring spirit that you are 
while we reject your system as you have taught us 
free thought and bnken down the rule of tyranny 
we undauntedly speculate even in opposition to you” 

descartes is oven yet soken of especially by french 
writers as the person who first asserted and estab 
lished the freedom of inquiry which is the boast of 
modem philosophy but this is said wdth reference to

chapter xviil 


newton 


i dold and extensive as fiad been tlie antici 
pations of those whose minds were excited 
by the promise of the ncav philosophy the discoveries 
of newton respecting tlie mechanics of the imi verse 
brought into view truths more general and profound 
than those earlier jdiilosophers had hoped or imagined 
with these vast accessions to human knowledge mens 
thoughts wcre again set in action and philosophers 
made earnest and various attempts to draw from these 
extiuordiaary advances in science the true moral with 
regard to the conduct and limits of the human under 
standing tliey not only endeavoured to verify and 
illustrate by these new portions of science what had 
recently been taught concerning the methods of ob 
taining sound knowledge but they were also led to 
speculate concerning many new and more interesting 
questions relating to this subject they saw for the 
lirst time or at least far more clearly than before the 
distinction between the inquiry into the lauosy and into 
the catiees of phenomena they were tempted to ask 
how far the discovery of causes could be carried and 
whether it would soon reach or clearly point to the 
ultimate cause they were driven to consider whether 
the properties which they discovered were essential 
proerties of all matter necessarily and primarily in 
volved in its essence though revealed to us at a late 
jperiod by their derivative effects tliose questions 
even now agitate the tlioughts of speculative mem 
some of thorn have already in this work been disr 
cussed or amingcd inthe places which our view of the 
philosophy of these subjects assigns to them but we 



 philosophy of discovery 

must here notice them as they occurred to newton 
himself and his immediate followeis 

 the general baconian notion of the method of 
philasoplizing — that it consists in ascending fi’om phe 
nomena through various stages of generalization to 
truths of the highest order — received in newton’s dls 
coveiy of the universal mutual giavitation of every 
jarticle of matter that pointed actual exemplification 
for want of which it had hitherto been almost over 
looked or at least very vaguely undcsratood that 
great truth and tlie stejs by whicli it was established 
atford even now by far the best example of the suc 
cessive ascent from one scientific truth to another — 
of the repeated transition from less to more general pro 
positions — which we can yet produce as may be seen 
in the table which exhibits the relation of these steps 
in book ii of the novum organon renovatuvn newton 
himself did not fail to recognize this feature in the 
truths vrhich he exhibited thus ho says “by the 
way of analpis wo proceed from compounds to ingre 
dients as from motions to the forces producing them 
and in general from effects to tlieir xauses and from 
particular causes to more general ones till the argument 
ends in the most general” and in like manner in ano 
ther query “the main business of natural philoso 
phy is to argue from phenomena without feigning hyjo 
theses and to deduce causes from effects tul we come 
to the first caiiso which is certainly not mechanical” 

 newton appears to have had a horror of the 

term hypothesis which probably arose fnm his ac 
quaintance with the rash and illicit general assump 
tions of descartes thus in the passage just quoted 
after declaring that giavity must have some other 
cause than matter he says “ later philosophers banish 
the consideration of such a cause out of natural phi 
losophy feigning hypotheses for jixplaining all things 
mechanically and referring causes to meta 

physics” in the celebrated bcholium at the end of 


 piticiqtl near tbeend

the principia he says “whatever is not deduced 
from the phenomena is to be termed hyiothesis and 
hypotheses whether metaphysical or physical or oc 
cult causes or mechanical have no place in experi 
mental philosophy in this philosophy propositions 
are deduced from phenomena and rendered general vy 
induction” and in another place ho arrests the 
course of his own suggestions sjxying “ venim hypo 
theses noli fingo” i have alrwidy attempt d to show 
that this is in reality a superstitious and selfdestmc 
tivc spirit of speculation some hypotheses are neces 
saiy in order to connoct the facts which arc observd 
some new principle of unity must be applied to the 
phenomena before induction can be attempted what 
is requisite is that the hyjiothesis should be close to 
the facts and not connected with them by the interme 
diation of other arbitrary and untried tiiets and that 
the philosopher should be ready to resign it as soon as 
the facts refuse to confirm it we have seen in the 
history y that it was by such a use of hypothvses that 
both newton himself and kepler on whose discoveries 
those of newton were based made their discoveries 
the suppositions of a force tending to the sun and vary 
ing inversely as the square of the distance of a mutual 
force between all the bodies of the solar system of the 
force of each body arising from the attraction of all its 
larts not to mention others ajso propounded by 
newton — were all hypotheses before they were veri 
fied as tlkoories it is related that when newton was 
asked how it was that he saw into the laws of nature 
so inuqh further than other men ho replied that if it 
were so’ it resulted from his keeping his thoughts 
steadily oqcupied upon the subject which was to be 
thus penetrated but what is this occupation of the 
thoughts if it he not the process of keeping the phe 
nomena clearly in vfow and trying one after another

 philosophy op discovery 

 with regard to the detail of the process of 
disooveiy newton has given us some of his views 
which are well worthy of notice on account of their 
coming from him and which arc real additions to the 
philosophy of this subject ho speaks repcjxtedly of 
the aaalysia and syrttiesis of observed fhets and thus 
marks certain steps in scientific research very import 
ant and not i think clearly pointed out by his prede 
cessors thus he says “ah in mathematics so in 
natuml philosophy the investigation of difficult things 
by the method of anfiysis ought ever to precede the 
method of composition this analysis consists in mak 
ing experiments and obseiwations and in drawing 
general conclusions from them by induction and ad 
mitting of no objections against the conclusions but 
such as are taken from experiments or other certain 
truths and although the arguing from exjcriments 
and observations by induction be no demonstration of 
general conclusions yet it is the best way of arguing 
which the nature of things admits of and may bo look 
ed upon as so much the stronger by how much the 
induction is more general” and he then obsetves as 
wc have quotd aboj that by this way of analysis wo 
proceed from compounds to ingredients from motions 
to forces from efiects to causes and from less to more 
general causes the analysis here spoken of includes 
the jdteps which in our novum organon we call the 
deconqiosition of facts the exact chservatlon and meor 
sarfinienl of tjie phenomena and the cmujation of facts 
the necessary intermediate step the selection and expli 
cation of the appropriate conception being passed over 
by newton in the fear of seeming to encourage the 
fabrication of hypotheses the syntjmis of which new 
ton here speaks consists of those steps of deductive rea 
soningy proceeding from the conception once assumed 
which are requisite for the comparison of its conse 
quences with the observed ftets this his statement 
i the process of research is as far as it goes perfectly 
exact

g in speaking of newton’s precepts on the subt 
we are naturally led to the celebrated “ rules of rhi 
losophizing” inserted in the second edition of the priri 
cipii these rules have generally been quoted and 
commented on with an almost unquestioning reverence 
such rules coming from such an authority cannot 
fail to be highly interesting to us but at the same 
tiuie wo cannot here evade the necessity of scrutinis 
ing their truth and value according to the piinciplea 
wdiich our survey of this subject has brought into view 
the rules stand at the beginning of tfuit part of the 
prinnpia the third book in which he infers the mu 
tual gravitation of the sun moon planets and all parts 
of each they are as folliws 

“ rule i we are not to admit other caiises of na 
tural things tluui such as both arc true and suffice for 
explaining their phenomena 

“rule natural effects of the same kind are 
to be referred to the same caused its ikr sls can be 
done 

“ rule iii the qualities of bodies which cannot 
be increased or diminished in intensity and which be 
long to all bodies in which we can institute experi 
lucuts are to bo held for qualities of all bodies what 
ever 

“ rule iv experimental philosophy proposi

bo held as true either accurately or approximately not 
withstanding contrary hyjxthescs till other pheno 
mcna occur by which they may be rendered either 
more accurate or liable to exception’ 

in considering these rules we cannot help remark 
ing in the first place that they are constructed with 
an intentional adaptation to the case with which new 
ton has to deal— the induction of universal gravita 
tion and are intended to protect the reasonings before 
which they stand thus the first rule is designed to 
strengthen the inference of gravitation from the celcl 
tial phenomena by describing it as a vera cemsa a true 
cause the second rule countenances the doctrine that 
the jdanctary motions are governed by mechanical

forces as terrestrial motions are the third rule ap 
pears intended to justify the assertion of gmvitatioii 
as a universal quality of bodies and the fourth con 
tains along with a general declaration of the authority 
of induction the author’s usual protest ainst hypo 
theses levelled at the cartesian hypotheses especisdly 

 of the first buie — we however must consi 
der those kules in their general application in which 
point of view they have often been refeired to and 
have had very great authority allowed them one of 
the points which has been most discussed is that 
maxim which requires that the causes of phenomena 
which we assign should be tnie causes verce causae 
of coui’se this does not mean jhat they should be the 
tmo or right cause for although it is the philosophers 
aim to discover such causes be would be little aided 
in his search of truth by being told that it is tinith 
which he is to seek the rule has generally been un 
derstood to prescribe that in attempting to account for 
any class of phenomena wo must assume such causes 
only as from other comiderations we know to exist 
thus gravity which was employed in explaining the 
motions of the moon and planets was already known 
to exist ajjd operate at the earth’s surface 

jiow the rule thus interpreted is i conceive an 
injurious limitation of the field of induction for it 
forbids us to look for a cawc except among the causes 
with which we are already familiar but if we follow 
this rule how shall we ever become acquainted with 
any new catise or how do we know that the pheno 
mena which we contemplate do really arise from some 
qause which we already truly know if they do not 
must we still insist upon making them depend upon 
some of our known causes or must we abandon the 
study of them altogetlier must we for example 
resolve to refer the action of radiant heat to the air 
rather than to any peotdiar fluid or ether because the 
former is known to exist the latter is merely assumed 
for the purpose of explanation but why sfobuld we 
do this why should we not endeavour to learn tibe 
cause from the effects even if it be dot already known 



newton 


 

to tis we can infer causoa which new when we 
first beccmie acquainted with them chemical forces 
optical forces vital forces are known to us only hy 
chemical and optical and vital phenomena must we 
therefore reject their existence or abandon their study 
they do not conform to the double condition that they 
shall be sufficient and oho real they are tnie only so 
far as they explain the facts but are they therefore 
unintelligible or useless are they not highly im 
lortant and instructive subjectof sjiecjilation and 
if the gravitation which rules the motions of the pla 
nets had not existed at the earths surface — if it had 
been there masketl and concealed by the superior effect 
of magnetism or some other extraneous force — might 
not newton still have inferred from kepler’s laws 
the tendency of the planets to the sun and from their 
peiturbations their tendency to each other his dis 
coveries would still have been immense if tlm cause 
which he assigned had not been a vera causa in tha 
sense now contemplated 

 but what do wo mean by calling gravity a “true 
cause” how do we learn its reality’ of coui by 
its effects with which we are familiar — by the weight 
and fall of bodies about us these strike even the 
most careless obseiwer no one can fail to see that all 
bodies wliich we come in contact with are heavy— 
that gravity acts in our neighbourhood here upon 
earth hence it may be said this cause is at any 
rate a true cause whether it explains the celestiid 
phenomena or not 

but if this he what is meant by a vera causa it 
appears strange to jequire that jn all cases we should 
find such a one to account for all classes of pheno 
mena is it reasonable or prudent to demand that wo 
shall reduce every set of phenomena however minute 
or abstruse or complicate to causes so obviously ex 
isting as to strike the most incurious and to bo fami 
liar among men how can we expect to find st 
wree eatam for tie delicate and recondite phenomena 
which aif exact and skilfuf observer detects in chemi 
cal or optical or electrical experineiits the facts 



 philosophy op discovery 

themselves are too fine for vulgar apprehcon their 
relations their symmetries their measuies require a 
previous discipline to understand them how then 
can their causetr be found among those agencies with 
which the common unscientific herd of mankind are 
familiar what likelihood is there that causes held 
for real by such persons shall explain facts which such 
persons cannot see or cannot understand 

again if we give authority to such a rule and 
require that the causey by which science explains the 
facts which she notes and measures and analyses shall 
be causes which men without any special study have 
already come to believe in from the effects which they 
casually sec around them what is this except to make 
our first rude and unscientific persuasions the criterion 
and test of our most laborious and thoughtful infer 
ences what is it but to give to ignorance and 
thoughtlessness the right of pronouncing upon the con 
victions of intense study and ibngdisciplined thought 
“electrical atmospheres’ surrounding electrized bo 
dies were at one time held to be a “true cause” of 
the effects which such bodies produce these atmo 
spheres it was said are obvious to the senses we 
feel them like a spider’s web on the hands and face 
®pinus had to answer such persons by proving that 
there are no atmospheres no effluvia but only repul 
sion he thus for a true came in the vulgar sense of 
the term substituted an hypothesis yet who doubts 
that what he did was an advance in the science of 
electricity 

 perhaps some persons may be disposed to say 
that kewton’s pule does not enjoin us to take those 
causes only wliich we clearly know or supimse we 
know to be really existing and operating but only 
causes of such kiri as we have already satisfied our 
selves do exist in nature it may be urged that we 
are entitled to infer that the planets are governed in 
their motions by an attractive force becaluse we jsnd 
in the bodies immediately subject to observation and 
experiment that such motiens ore produced by attitm 
live forces for exiple by that of the earth it may 



newton 


 

be said that we might on similar grounds infer forces 
which unite particles of chemical compounds or deflect 
particles of light because we see adhesion and deflec 
tion produced by forces 

but it is easy to show that the buie thus laxly un 
derstood loses all significance it prohibits no hypo 
thesis for all hypotheses suppose causes mch as in 
some case or other wo have seen in action no one 
would think of explaining phenomena by refejring 
them to forces and agencies altogether different from 
any which are known for on this supposition how 
could he pretend to reason about the elfects of the 
assumed causes or undertake to prove that they would 
explain the facts some close similarity with some 
known kind of cause is requisite in order that the 
hypothesis may have the appearance of an explana 
tion no forces or virtues or sympathies or fluids 
or ethei’s would bo excluded by interpretetion of 
verie camce least of all would such an interpreta 
tion reject the cartesian hypothesis of vortices which 
ujiidoubtedly as i coneeitc newton intended to con 
demn by his buie for that such a case as a whirling 
fluid carrying bodies round a centre in orbits does 
occur is too obvious to require proof every eddying 
stream or blast that twirls the dust in the road ex 
hibits exampbis of such action and would justify the 
assumption of the vortices which carry the planets in 
their courses tis indeed without doubt such facts 
suggested the cartesian explanation of tlie solar sys 
tem the vortices in this mode of considering the 
subject are at the least as real a cause of motion as 
gravity itself 

 thus the rule which enjoins “ true causes” is 
nugatory if we take vertr cauace in the extended sense 
of any causes of a real kind and unphilosophical if wo 
understand the term of thoae very causes which wc 
familiarly suppose to exist but it may be said that 
we are to ddsigiiate as “true causes” not those whidh 
are collected in a loose confused and precarious man 
ner by undisciplined minds from obvious phenomena 
but those which are justly and rigoroudy inferred 



 philosophy op discovert 

such a cause it may be added gravity is for the 
facts of the downward pressures and downward mo 
tions of bodies at the earth’s surface lead us by the 
plainest and strictest induction to the assertion of 
such a force now to this interpretation of tlie buie 
there is no objection but then it must be observed 
that on this view terrestrial gravity is inferred by the 
same process as celestial giavitation and the cause is 
no more entitled to be called ‘true” because it is 
obtained from the forpier than because it is obtained 
from the latter class of facta we thus obtain an in 
telligible and tenable explanation of a vera causa 
but then by this cxlanation its verity ceases to be 
distinguishable from its other condition that it sut 
fices for the explanation of the phenomena” the 
assumption of universal gravitation accounts for the 
fall of a stone it also accounts for the revolutions of 
the moon or of saturn but since both these explana 
tions are of the same kind we cannot with justice 
make the one a criterion or condition of the admis 
sibility of the other 

to but still the buie so understood is so far 
from being unmeaning or frivolous that it expresses 
one of the most iinpohant tests which can be given of 
a sound physical theory it is true the explanation 
of one set of facts may be of the same nature as the 
explanation of the other class but then that the 
cause explains both classes gives it a very different 
claim upon our attention and assent from that which 
it would have if it explained one class only the 
very circumstance that the two explanations coincide 
is a most weighty presumption in their favour it is 
the testimony of two witnesses in behalf of the hypo ’ 
thesis and in proportion as these two witnesses are 
separate and independent the conviction produced by 
their agreement is more and more complete when 
the explanation of two kinds of phenomena distinct 
ahd not apparently connected leads us to the same 
cause such a coincidence does give a reality to the 
cause which it has not while it merely accounts for 
those appearances which suggested the supposition

this coincidence of propositions inferred from sepa 
rate classes of facts is exactly what we noticed in the 
novwni organon eenovatnm b ii c g sect as 
one of the most decisive characteristics of a true 
theory under the name of confsilience of induetion 
that kewton’a first ilule of philosophizing so un 
derstood authorizes the inferences which he himself 
made is really the ground on which they are so firmly 
believed by philosophers thus avhen tlie doctrine of 
a gmvity vaiying inversely as the square of the dis 
tance from the body accounted at the same time for 
the relations of times and distances in the planetary 
orbits and for tlie amount of the moon’s deflection 
from the tangent of her orbit such a doctrine became 
most convincing or again when the doctrine of the 
iiniveial gravitation of all parts of matter wljich 
explained so admirably the inequalities of tlie moon’s 
motions also gave a satisfactory account of a pheno 
menon utterly diflereiit the precession of the equi 
noxes and of the same kind is the evidence in 
fsivour of the undulatory theory of light when the 
assumption of the length of an undulation to which 
vre are led by the colouis of thin plates is found to be 
identical with that length which explains the pheno 
mena of difli’action or when the hyothesis of tvans 
veise vibrations suggested by the tacts of polarization 
explains also the laws of double refiuction when 
such a convergence of two trains of induction points 
to the same spot w e can no longer suspect that we 
are wrong such an accumulation of proof really 
persuades us that we have to do’ with a vera causa 
and if this kind of jiroof be multiplied — if we again 
find other facts of a sort uncontemplated in framing 
our hypothesis but yet clearly accounted for when we 
have adopted the supposition — wo are still fuiilier 
confirmed in oiu belief and by such accumulation of 
proof we may be so fiu satisfied as to believe without 
 conceiving it possible to doubt in this easc when 
the validity of the opinion adopted by us has been 
repeatedly confirmed by its sufficiency in unforeseen 
cases so that all doubt is removed and forgotten the

theoretical cause takes its place among the of 

the world and becomes a trm cvease 

it newton’s buie then to avoid mistakes might 
be thus espressed that “ we may provisorily assume 
such hypothetical cause as will account for any given 
class of natural hcuomena but that when two dlf 
fereiit classef of facts lead us to the sme hypothesis 
wo may hold h to be a trm came and this buie 
will rari‘ly or never mislead us there are no in 
stances in wliich a doctrine recommemdod in this 
manner has avterwaras been discovered to be false 
there have been hyiotheses which liave exilainod 
many phenomena and kept their giound long and 
have afterwards been rejected but these have been 
hypotheses which explained only one class of pheno 
mena j and their fall took jdace when another kind of 
cts was examined and brought into conflict with the 
former thus the system of eccentrics and ejucycles 
accounted for all the observed mittiom of the planets 
and was the means of expresbing and transmitting all 
astronomical knowledge for two thousand years but 
then how was it ovei thrown by considcjiing the 
distances as well as motions of the heavenly budios 
here was a second class of facts and when the sys 
tem was adjusted so as to agree with the one class it 
was at variance with the other these cycles and 
epicycles could not be true because tliey could not be 
made a just representation of the facts but if tlie 
measures of diiance bs well as of position had con 
qired in pointing out the cycles and ejncyclos os the 
aths of the planets the paths so determined could 
not have been otherwise than their real ixitlis and 
the epicyelieal theory would have been at least geo 
metrically true 

 of the iecond rule — newton’s second buie 
directs that natural events of the mine kind are to 
iw referred to the same cames so far as can be done” 
such a precept at fimt appears to help us but little 
for all systems however little solid profess to conform 
to such a rule when any theorist undertakes to ex 
plain a class of facts ho assigns causes which according 



newton 


 

to btlq will by tlieir natural action as seen in other 
cases produce the effects in question the events 
which he accounts for by his hypothetical cause are 
he holds of the same kind as those which such a cause 
is kjiown to produce kepler in ascribing the pla 
netaiy motions to magnetism descartes in explaining 
them by means of vortices held that they were re 
ferring celestial motions to the causes yrhich give rise 
to terrestrial motions of the ssime kind the question 
is are tlio effects of the siimo kind this once settled 
there will be no question about the propnety of assign 
ing them the same cause biit tlie difficulty is to 
deteimino when events arc of the same kind are 
the motions of the planets of the same kind with the 
motion of a body moving freely in a curvilinear 
path or do they not rather resemble the motion of a 
 floating body swept round by a whirling current the 
newtonian and the cartesian answered this question 
differently how then can wo a ply this rule with 
any advantage 

t to this we rejly that there is no way of escap 
ing tills iincertainiy and ambiguity but by obtaining 
a clear possession of the ideas which our hypothesis 
involves and by reasoning rigorously from them 
newton assorts that the planets move in free paths 
acted on by certain fcuces the most exact calcula 
tion gives the closst agreement of the results of this 
hyjiothesis with the frets descartes asserts that the 
planets arc carried iound y a fluid the more rigor 
ously the conceptions of force and the laws of motion are 
applied to this hypothesis the more signal is its frilure 
in reconciling the frets to one another without such 
calculation we can come to no decision between the 
two hypotheses if the newtonian hold that the 
motions of the planets aie evidenuy of the same kind 
as those of a body describing a curve in free space 
and therefore like that to be explained by a fbroe 
acting uponfbo body the cartesian denies that thd 
planets do move in free space they are he main 
tains immersed in a plenum it is only when it 
appears that comets pass through this plenum in all

directioxxs with no impediment and that no possible 
form and motion of its whirlpools can explain ihe forces 
and motions which are observed in the solar system 
that lie is compelled to allow the newtonian’s classijh 
cation of events of the same khid 

thus it does not appear that this rule of newton 
can be interjmeted in any distinct and positive manner 
otherwise than as enjoining that in the task of induc 
tion we employ clear ideas rigoifus reasoning and 
close and fair compajison of the results of the hypo 
thesis with tlie facts these are no doubt important 
and fundamental conditions of a just induction but 
in this injunction we find no peculiar or technical 
criterion by which we may satisfy ourselves that we 
are right or detect our enors still of such general 
prudential iules none can be more wise than one 
which thus in the task of connecting hicts by means 
of ideas recommends that the ideas be clear the mets 
correct and the chain of reasoning which connects 
them without a flaw 

 of hia third buie — the third rule that 
 qualities which are obseived without exception be 
held to be universal” as i have alreawly said seems to 
be intended to authorize the asscition of gravitation 
as a universal attribute of matter we formerly stated 
in treating of mechanical ideas that this application 
of such a rule appears to be a mode of reasoning far 
from conclusive the assertion of the universality of 
any property of bodies mfist be grounded upon the 
reason of the case and not upon any ai’bitrary maziiii 
is it intendcml by this rule to prohibit any further ex 
amination how fai gravity is an original property of 
matter and how far it may be resolv into the resali 
of other agencieal we know perfectly well that this 
was not newton’s intention since the cause of gravity 
was a point which ho proposed to himself as a subject 
of inquiry it would certainly be very unphilosopmeal 
to pretend by this rule of piulobopfaizing to prqjudge 
the question of such hypotheses as thatof mosotti 


• amory uule s 




newt 


 

that gravity is the excess of the electrical attraction 
over electrical repulsion and yet to adopt this hy 
pothesis would be to supose electrical forces more 
truly universal than gravity for according to the 
hypothesis gravity being the inequality of the attc 
tion and repulsion is only an accidental and partial 
relation of these forces nor would it be allowable to 
urge this kule as a reason of assuming that double 
stars are attiacted to each other by a foice varying 
accortling to the inverse square of the disitance with 
out examining as hcrschel and others haax‘ done the 
orbits which they really describe but if the rule 
is not available in sich cases what is its real value and 
authority and in what cases are they exemplified 

 in a former work® it was shown that the 
fundamental laws of motion and the pi’operties of 
matter which these involve are after a full considera 
tion of the subject unavoidably assumed as univei’sally 
true it was further shown that although our know 
ledge of these laws and fropertios be gathered from ex 
perience we are strongly impelled some philosoher 
think autliorized to look upon these as not only uni 
versally but necessarily true it was also stated that 
the law of giuvitation though its uiilversality may be 
deemed probable does not apparently involves the same 
necessity as the fundamental laws of motion but it 
was pointed out that these are some of the most 
abstnise and difficult questions of the whole of phi 
losophy involving the profound peihais insoluble 
problem of the identity or diversity of ideas and 
things it cannot therefore bo deemed philosophical 
to cut these gordian knots by peremptory maxims 
wliich encourage us to decide without rendering a 
reason moreover it appears clear that the reason 
which is rendered for this rule by the newtonians is 
quite untenable namely that we know extension 
hardness and inertia to be universal qualities of bo 
dies by experience alone and that we have the same

evidence of experience for the universality of gravita 
tion we have already observed that we cannot with 
any propriety say that we find by experience all bodies 
are extended this could not be a just assertion 
unless we conceive the possibility of our linding the 
contrary but who can conceive our finding by ex 
perience some bodies which are not extended it 
apeais then that the reason given for the third 
rule of newton involves a inishiko respecting the 
nature and futliority of experience and the rule 
itself cannot be appliid without attempting to decide 
by the casual limits of observation questions wliicli 
necessarily depend upon the relations of ideas 

 of the fourth llule — newtoifs fourth rule 
is that ‘propositions collected from phenomena by 
induction shall be held to be true notwitlistiniding 
contrary hypotlieses but shall be liable to be remjered 
more accurate or to have their exceptions ointcd out 
by additional study of phenomena” tliis rule con 
tains little move than a grieral assertion of the autho 
rity of induction accoinpauied by newton’s usued 
protest against hyiotlieses 

 tlio rcjilly valuable pait of the foiihh rule is that 
which implies that a constant vcriticjation and if neces 
sary rectification of truths discovered by induction 
should go on in the scientific woi’ld even when the 
law is or appears to be most certainly exact and uni 
versal it should be constantly exhibited to us afresh in 
the form of expeiiencc and observation this is neces 
sary in order to discover exceptions and mtalificatioiis 
if such exist and if the law be idgorously true the 
contemplation of it as exemplified in the world of 
phenomena will best give us that clear apprehension 
of its bearings whifth may lead us to see the ground of 
its tnith 

the concluding clause of this fourth rule appears 
at first to imply tliat all inductive piopositions are tq 
be considered as merely provisional and limited and 
never secure from exception but to judge thus would 
be to underrate the staliility and genendity of scientioc 
truths for what man pf science can suppose that wo

stall hereafter discover exceptions to the universiil 
gravitation of all parts of the solar system and it 
is plain that the autlior did not intend the restric 
tion to be aiplied so rigorously for in the third rule 
iis we have just seen he authorizes us to infer uni 
versal ropei’tie of matter from obscivation and car 
ries the liberty of inductive infemioe to its full 
cottcnt the third rule jpefirs to encourage us to 
assert a law to be univerwd even in ui which 

it has not been tried the fonih rule seems to warn 
us that the law may be inaccurate even in cases in 
which it lias been tried nor is either of these sug 
gestions erroneous but both the universality and the 
rigorous accuracy of our laws are proved by reference 
to ideas niiher than to experience a truth which 
perhaps the philosophers of iscwtoii’s time were some 
whjt disosed to overhuk 

 the disposition to ascribe all our knowledge to 
experience appears in newton and the newtonians 
by other indications for instance it is seen in their 
extreme dislike to the ancient expressions by which 
the principles and causes of phenomena were described 
as the ocmlt causm of the schoolmen and aq forms 
of the aristotelians which had been adopted by bacon 
newton says that the particles of matter not only 
possess inertia hut iuso active princijdcs as gravity 
fermentation cohesion lie adds these principles i 
consider not as occult qualities supposed to result 
from the specific forms of things but as general 
liaws of nature by which the tilings themselves are 
formed their truth appearing to us by phenomena 
though their causes be not yet discovered for these 
are manifest qualities and their causes only are occult 
and the aristotelians gave the name of occult qualhies 
not to manifest qualities but to such qualities only a 
they suppostxl to lie hid in bodies and to the unkiiown 
causes of manifest effects such as would be the causes 
of gravity and of magnetick and olectrick attractions

and of fermentations if we should suppose that these 
forces or actions arose from qualities unknown to us 
and incapable of being discovered and made manifest 
such occult qualities put a stop to the improvement of 
natural philosophy and therefore of late years have 
leen rejected to tell us that every species of things 
is endowed with an occult sjecific quality by which it 
acts and produces manifest eflects is to tell us no 
thing but to derive two or three general principles of 
iiintioii from phenomena and afterwards to tell us how 
the properties and actions of all coiporeal things fol 
low from those manifest principles would be a great 
step in philosojihy though the causes of those prin 
ciples were not yet disovered and therefore t scruple 
not to propose the principles of inotlon above main 
tained they being of very geneial extent and leave 
their ciuises to be found out” 

 all that is here said is highly philosophical and 
valuable but we may observe that the investigation of 
pecijic forms in the sense in which some writers had 
used the phrase was by no means a frivolous or un 
meaning object of inquiry bacou and otheis had used 
form as equivalent to law if we could ascertain 
that anangement of the particles of a crystal from 
which its external crystalline form and other proper 
ties arise this arrangement would be the internal form 
of the crystal if the undulatory theory be true the 
form of light is transverse vibrations if the emission 
theory bo maintained the form of light is particles 
moving in straight lines and deflected by various 
forces both the terms and law imply an ideal 
connexion of sensible phenomena form supposes mai

is perhaps the better metaphor but the former also 
contains the essential antithesis which belongs to the 
subject and might be used in expressing the same con 
clusions 

but occult causes employed in the way in which

 but the most valuable part of the view present 
ed to us in the quobition just given from newton is 
the distinct separation alrctidy noticed as peculiarly 
biought into prominence by him of the determination 
of the laiva of phenomena and thf investigation of 
their causes the maxim that the former inquiry 
must precede the latter and that if the general laws

i tn tlie constant opposition and trugle of tle

oiu knowledge we have seen that at the periki of 
which w’c now treat the tendency was to exalt the 
cxteitial and disparage the internal elements the dis 
position to ascribe our knowledge to observation alone 
had already in bacon’s time led him to dw’ell to a 
disproportionate degree upon that half of his subject 
and inul tinged newton’s expressions though it liad 
not biassed his practice but this partiality soon as

of the first to express in a plain and unhesitating 
manner ojunions wliich had for some time been ripen 
ing in the minds of a large portion of the cultivated 
public hobbes had already promulgated the main 
doctrines which locke aftemards urged on the sub 
ject of the origin and nature of our knowledge but 
in him these doctrines were combinetl with offensive 
opinions on points of morals government and religion 
 that their access to general favour was impeded 
and it was to locke that they were indebted for the 
extensive influence which they soon after obtained 
locke owed this authority mainly to the intellectual 
circumstances of the time although a writer of 
great merit he by no means possesses suck metaphysi 
cal acuteness or such philosophical largeness of view

or such a charm of writing as must necessarily give 
him the liigh place he has held in the literature of 
europe but he came at a period when the reign of 
ideas was totteidng to its ml all tlie most active 
and ambitious spirits had gone over to the new opinions 
and were prepared to follow the fortunes of the philo 
sophy of experiment then in the most prospeious 
and brilliant condition and full of still brighter pro 
mise there wore indeed a few learned and thought 
ful men who still remained faithful to the empire of 
ideas partly it may be from a too fond attachment 
to ancient systems but partly also because they knew 
that there were subjects of vast imiortance in which 
experience did not form the whole foundation of our 
knowledge they knew too that many of the jdau 
sible tenets of the new pliilosophy were revivals of 
fallacies which had been discussed and refuted in an 
cient times but the advocates of mere experience 
came on with a vast store of weighty truth among 
their artillery and with the energy which the advance 
usually bestows the ideal system of philosophy could 
for the present make no etfcctual resistance locke 
by putting himself at the head of the assault became 
the hero of his day and his name has been used an 
the watchword of those who ivdhero to the philosophy 
of the senses uj to our own times 

 locke himself did not assert the exclusive au 
thority of the senses in the extreme unmitigated 
manner in which some who cal themselves his disci 
ples have done but tliia is the common lot of the 
leaders of revolutions for they are usually bound by 
some ties of affection and habit to the previous sta 
of things and would not destroy all traces of 
condition while their followeiib attend not to their 
inconsistent wishes but to the meaning of the revolu 
tion itself and carry out to their genuine and com 
plete results the principles which won the victory 
and which have been brought out more sharp from 
the conflict thus locke himself does not assert that 
all our ideas are derived from sensation but from 
sensation cmd reflection but it was easily seen that 



locke and his french followers 

in this assertion two very heterogeneous elements 
were conjoined that while to pronounce sensation 
the origin of ideas is a clear decided tenet the ac 
ceptance or rejection of which determines the general 
character of our philosophy to make the same decla 
ivition concerning reflection is in the highest degree 
vagu and ambiguous since reflection may either be 
resolved into a mere modifleation of sensation as was 
done by one school or may mean all that the opposite 
school opposes to sensation un pr the name of ideas 
hence tlie clear and strong impression which fastened 
upon men’s minds and which does in tact represent 
all the systematic and consistent part of locke’s phi 
losothy whs that in it all our ideas arc rereseuted 
as derived from sonsiition 

 we need not sjend much time in pointing out 
the inconsistencies into which locke fell as all must 
fall into inconsistencies who recognize no source of 
knowledge except the senses thus he maintains that 
our idea of hpace is derived from the senses of sight 
and touch our idea of solidity from the touch alone 
our notion of sulstiinco is an unknown snpjoit of 
imknown qualities and is illustrated by tlie indian 
fable of the toitoiso which supports the elephant which 
supports the world our notun of towner or cause 
is in like manner got from the senses and yet 
though these idexs are thus mere fragments of our 
expeiience locke does not hesitate to ascribe to them 
necessity and universality when they occur in pro 
positions thus he maintains the necessary truth of 
geometrical properties he asserts that the resistance 
arising froia solidity is absolutely insurmountable he 
conceives that nothing short of omnipotence can 
annihilate a paiticle ot matter” and he has no mis 
givings in arguing upon the axiom that every thing 
must have a cause he does not perceive that upon 
his own account of the origin of our knowledge we 
cai have no right to make any of these assertions it

of common thinkers

an anomalous part of his philosophy and declared that 
sensation alone was the source of ideas among these 
wiitcrs oondillac was the most distinguished he 
expressed the leading tenet of their school in a clear 
and iointed manner by saying tlnit “all ideas are 
transformed sensations” we have already considered 
this phrase and need not here dwell upon it 

opinions such as these tend to annihilate as we 
have seen one of the two coordinate ekriicnts of our 
knowledge yet they were tar from btdng so preju 
dicial to the progress of science or even of the philo 
sophy of science as miglit havc been anticipated one 
reason of this was that they wert‘ practiall’ conccted 
especially among the cultivattns of natural philosophy 
by tlic study of matlicmatics fur that study did really

human knowledge but was on the contrary a zealous 
admirer of the evidence and connexion which appear 
in those scicnces which have the ideas of space and 
number for their foundation especially the latter he 
looked for the grounds of the certainty and reality of 
the knowledge which these sciences contain and found 
them as he conceived in the nature of the language 
which they employ the signa which are used in 
arithmetic and algebia enable us to keep steadily in 
view the identity of the same quantity under all tlie 
forms which by comxisition and decomposition it 
may be made to assume and these signs also not 
only express the operations which are performed but 
suggest the extension of tho operations according to 
analogy algebra according to him is only a very 
perfect language and language answei’s its purjxbe of 
leading us to truth by ossessing the characteristics of 
algebrti words are the symbols of certain groups of 
impressions or facts they are so selected and apjdiod 
as to exhibit the analogies which prevail among these 
facts and these analogies are the truths of which our 
knowledge consists “ every language is an analytical 
method every analytical method is a language®’ 
these were the truths “ alike new and simple’ as he 
held which he conceived that he had demonstrated 
“the art of speaking the art of writing the art of 
reasoning the art of thinking are only at bottom one 
and the same art®’ each of these operations consists 
in a succession of analytical oerations and words are 
the marks by which we are able to fix our minds upon 
the £teps of this analysis 

 the analysis of our impressions and notions 
does in reality lead to truth not only in virtue of the 
identity of the whole with its parts as condillac held 
but also in virtue of certain ideas which govern the 
synthesis of our sensations and which contain the 
elements of universal truths as we have all along en 
dcvoured to show bat although condillac overkked 
or rejected this doctrine the importance of word as

marking the snccesaive steps of this synthesis and 
analysis is not less than he represented it to bo every 
truth once estiiblishcd by induction from facts when 
it is become familiar under a brief and precise form 
of expression become itself a feict and is cajable of 
being employed along with other facts of a like bind 
as the materials of fresh inductions in this successive 
process the terra like the cord of a fagot both binds 
together the facts which it includes and makes it pos 
sible to manage the assemblage a single thing on 
occasion of most discoveries in science tlie selection of 
a technical term is an essential part cf the proceeding 
in the history of science we have hail numerous op 
portunities of remarking this and the list of technical 
terms given as an index to that work refers us by 
almost every woixl to one such occasion and these 
terms which thus have had so large a share in the 
formation of science and which constitute its language 
do also offer the means of analyzing its truths each 
into us constituent truths and these into facts more 
special till the original foundations of our most gene 
ral piyiiwsitions are clearly exhibited the relations 
of general and particular truths arc most evidently 
represented by the inductive tables given in book 
of the novura organon renovatnm but each step 
in each of these tables has its proper form of ex 
pression familiar among the cultivators of science 
and the analysis which our tables display is com 
monly performed in men’s minds when it becomes 
necessary by fixing the attention successively upon a 
series of wonls not ukn the lines of a table lan 
guage offers to the mind such a scale or ladder as the 
table ofifers to the eye and since such tables present 
to uc as we have said the logic of induction that is 
the formal conditions of the soundness of our reasoning 
from facts we may with propriety say that a just ana 
 lysis of the meaning of words is an essential portion of 
inductive logic 

in saying this we must not forget that a decom 
position of general truths into ideas as well as into 
fimts belongs to our philosophy but the point we

havo here to remark is the essential importance of 
words to the latter of these procosscsl and this point 
had not ever had its due weight assigned to it till the 
time of condillac and other followers of locke who 
pursued their sieculauons in tje spirit i have just 
described the doctrine of the importance of terms is 
the most considerable addition to the philosophy of 
science which has been made since the time of bacon’ 

 the french encyclopedists — the french kncy 
clopmiey puldished in of which diderot and da 
lembcrt wiire the editors may bo conaiderctl as repre 
senting the leading chaiactei’s of european yhilosohy 
during the greater part of the oighteeiith century the 
writers in this work belong for the moat part to the 
school of locke and condillac and we may make a 
few remarks upon them in order to bring into view 
one or two points in addition to what wc have already 
said of that school the discours fruiminaire written 
by daloinbert is celebrated as containing a view of 
the origin of our knowledge and the connexion and 
class lication of the sciences 

a tendency of the speculations of the encyclope 
dists as of the school of locke in general is to reject 
all ideal principles of connoxion among facts as some 
thing which experience the only source of true know 
ledge docs not give hence all ceitain knowledge 
consists only in the recognition of the same thing un 
der different aspects or different forms of expression 
axioms are not tlie result of an original relation of 
ideas but of the use or it may be the abuse® of words 
in like manner the pi’opositioua of qeoniotry are a 
series of modifications — of distortions so to speak— 
of one original truth much as if the proposition were 
stated in the successive forms of expression presented 
by a language which was constantly growing more and 

since the selection and construe ciples shonld be laid down for the 
tlon of tonus is thus a matter of so performance of this operation some 
much conserpience in the fotmation such rules are accordingly suggested

toiore artificial several of the sciences which rest 
itpon physical principles that is says the writer 
truths of experience or simple hypotheses have only 
an expeiimehtal or hypothetical certainty impene 
trability added to th idea of extent is a mystery in 
addition the nature of motion is a liddle for philoso 
phers the metaphysical principle of the laws of per 
cussion is equally concealed from them the moire 
profoundly they study the idea of matter and of the 
properties which represent it jbe more obscure this 
idea becomes the more completely does it escape 
them 

 this iis a veiy common style of reflection even 
down to our own times liave endeavoured to shbw 
that conefenaing the fundamental ideas of space of 
force and resistance of substance external quality 
and the like we know enough to make these ideas the 
grounds of ceitain and univeisal truths — enough to 
supply us with axioms from which we can demonstra 
tively i’eason if men wish for any otlier knowledge 
of the nature of matter than that which ideas and 
facts conformable to ideas give them undoubtedly 
their desire will be fnistiated and they will be left in 
a mysterious vacancy for it does not appear how such 
knowledge as they ask for could be knowledge at all 
but in reality this complaint of our ignorance of the 
real nature of things proceeds from the rejection of 
ideas and the assiuuptioii of the senses alone as the 
ground of knowledge observation and calculation 
are the only sources of truth” this is tlie motto of 
the school of which we now speak and its import 
amounts to this — that they reject all ideas except the 
idea of number and recognixe the modifications which 
parts undergo by addition and subtraction as the only 
modes in which time propositions are generated the 
laws of nature are assemblages of facts the truths of 
• science are assertions of the identity of things whiq 
are the same by the avqwal of almost all philoso

tmtbs when once simplified and reduced to their low 
est terms are converted into facts and thenceforth 
present to the mind only this piopositioii the white is 
white the black is black” 

these stiitements are true iiwhat they positively 
assert but they involve error in the denial which by 
implication they convey it is true that obseiwation 
and demonstration are the only sources of scientific 
truth but then demonstration may be founded on 
other grounds besides the elemcntaiy properties of 
number it is true that the theory of gravitation is 
but the assertion of a general fact but this is so not 
because a sound theory docs not involve ideas but be 
cause our ajiprohension of a facit does 

 another characteristic indication of the temjier 
of the encyclopedists and of the age to which they 
belong is the irnportatice by them assigned to those 
practical arls which minister to man’s com fori and 
convenience not only in the body of the encyclo 
edia are the mechanical arts placed side by side 
with the sciences and treated at great length but in 
the preliminary discourse the preference assigned to 
the liberal over the mechanical arts is treated as a 
prejudice and the value of science is spoken of as 
measured by its utility “ the discovery of the mari 
ner’s compass is not less advantageous to the human 
race than the explanation of its properties would be to 
phyrics — why should we not esteem those to whom 
we owcitlie fusee and the escapement of watches as 
much as the inventors of algebral” and in the clas 
sification of sciences which accompanies the discourse 
the labours of artisans of all kinds have a place 

this classification of the lirious branches of science 
contained in the dissertation is often spoken of it 
lias for its basis the classification proposed by bacon 
in which the parts of human knowledge are arranged 
tyceording to the fiiculties of the mind in which tfa 
originate and these cultie are takeo botli by baooft 
and by dalembert as memory beason and imagi 


w p ul 




locke akd his french followers 


nation the insufficiency of bacon’s arrangement as a 
scientific classification is so glaring that the adoption 
of it with only superficial modifications at the period 
of the encyclopedia is a remarkable proof of the want 
of original thought aad real philobojdiy at the time of 
which we speak 

 we need not trace further the opinion which 
derives all our knowledge from the senses in its appli 
cation to the hilosophy of science its declared aim 
is to leduce all knowledge to th® knowledge of facts 
and it rejects all inquiries which involve the idea of 
cause and similar ideas describing them as “meta 
jihyaical” or in some other damnatory way it pro 
fesses indeed to discard all ideas but as vre have 
long ago seen sonic ideas or other are inevitably in 
cluded even in the simplest facts accordingly the 
speculations of this scliool are compelled to rettiin the 
relations of position succession number and kesem 
blance which are rigorously ideal relations the phi 
losophy of sensation in order to be consistent ought 
to reject these ideas along with the rest and to deny 
altogether the possibility of general knowledge 

when the opinions of the sensational school liad 
gone to an extreme length a reaction naturally began 
to take place in men’s minds such have been the 
alternations of opinion from the earliest ages of human 
speculation man may perhaps have existed in an 
oidginal condition in which he was only aware of the 
impiessions of sense but his first attempts t analyse 
his perceptions brought under his notice ideas as a 
separate element essential to the existence of know 
ledge ideas were thenceforth almost the sole subject 
of the study of philosophers of plato and his disci 
ples professedly of aristotle and still more of the 
followers and commentators of aristotle practically 
and this continued till the time of galileo when the 
• authority of the senses again began to be assertec 
for it was shown by the great discoveries which were 
then made that the senses had at least some share in 
the promotion of knowledge as discoveries more 
numerous and more striking were supplied by obser

ration the world gradually passed over to the opinion 
that the share which had been ascribed to ideas in the 
formation of real knowledge was altogether a delusion 
and that sensation alone was true but when this 
was asserted as a gencml doctrine both its manifest 
falsity and its alarming consequences roused men’s 
minds and made them recoil fixm the extreme point 
to which they wore approaching philosophy again 
oscillated back towards ideas and over a great part of 
europe in the clearest and most comprehensive minds 
this regression from the dogmas of tlie sensational 
school is at present the prevailing movement we 
shall conclude our ieview hy noticing a fevy indications 
of this state of things 



chapter xx 


the eeactjon against the sensational school 


i xitiien lodke’s essay appeared it was easily 
 t seon that its tendency was to urge in a much 
more rigorous sense than liad previously been usual 
the ancient maxim of aiistotle adopted by the school 
men of the middle ages that ‘‘nothing exists in the 
intellect but wliat has entered by the senses” leib 
nitz expressed in a jointcd manner the limitation with 
which this doctrine had always been understood “ ni 
hil est in inlellectu quod non piius fiierit in sensu — 
he added midlecius ipse to this it 

has been objected that we cannot say that the in 
tellect is in the intellect but this iemark is obvi 
ously frivolous for the faculties of the undeistanding 
which are what the argument iigainst the sensation 
school requires us to ieserve may be said to be in the 
understanding with as much justice as we may asseiij 
there are in it the impressions derived from sense 
and when we take account of these ulties and 
of the ideas to which by their operation we neces 
sarily subordinate our apprehension of phenoihcua we 
are led to a refutation of the philosophy which makes 
phenomena unconnected by ideas the source of all 
knowledge the succeeding opponents of the lockian 
school insisted upon and developed in various ways 
this remark of leibnitz or some equivalent view 

 it was by inquiries into the foundations of 
morals that english philosophers were led to question 
 the truth of locke’s theory dr price in his eevi

of the principal questions in morals first published 
in maintaineil that wo cannot with propriety 
assert all our ideas to be derived from sensation and 
reflection he pointed out very steadily the othov 
source “the power i assert that understandsj or 
the faculty within us that discerns trathy and that 
compares all the objects of thought nd judges of them 
is a spring of new ideas” and he exhibits the anti 
thesis in various forms “ were not sense and knovyhdge 
entirely different we hould rest satisfied with semsiblo 
impressions such as light colours and sounds and in 
quire no further about them at least when the im 
pressions are strong and vigorous avbereaa on the 
contrary we iecebsjirily desire some further aoipiaint 
ance with them iind cjin never be satisfied till wo liave

 the necessity of iefiiting hume’s inferences from 
the meresensation system led other writers to limit in 
various ways their assent to locke especially waa 
this the case with a number of intelligent metaphysi 
cians in scotland as rehl beattie dugald htewart 
and thomas brown thus reid asserts “that the 
account which mr locke himself gives of the idea of 
power cannot be reconciled to his favourite doctrine 
that all our simple ideas have their origin from sensa 
tion or reflection” reid remarks that our memory 
and our reasoning power come in for a share in the

origin of thin idea and in speaking of reasoning he 
obvioxisly assumes the axiom that every event must 
have a cause by succeeding writers of this school 
tlie assumption of the fundamental principles to wliich 
our nature in such cases irresistibly directs us is more 
clearly pointed out thus stewart defends the fonn 
of expression used by price® ‘‘a variety of intuitive 
judgments might bo mentioned involving simple ideas 
which it is impossible to trace to any origin but to the 
power which enables us to form these judgments thus 
it is surely an intuitive truth that the sensations of 
which i am conscious and all those i remember be 
long to one and the same being which i cull my self 
here is an intuitive judgment involving the simple 
idea of identity in like manner the changes which 
i perceive in the universe impress me with a convic 
tion that some cause must have operated to produce 
them hero is an intuitive judgment involving the 
simple idea of cmmuion when we consider the 
adjacent angles made by a straight line standing upon 
another and perceive that their sum is equal to two 
right angles the judgment we form involves a simple 
idea of kqnaluy to say therefore that the reason 
or the understiuiding is a source of iiav ideas is not 
so exceptionable a mode of speaking as has been some 
times supposed according to locke senise furnishes 
our ideas and reason perceives their agreements and 
disagreements but the truth is that these agree 
ments and disagreements are in many instances sim 
ple ideas of which no analysis can be given and of 
which the origin must tuerelurc be referred to reason 
according to locke’s own doctrine” this view ac 
cording to which the resison or understanding is the 
source of certain simple ideas such as identity oausa 
tioii iuality which ideas are necessarily involved 
in the intuitive judgments wliich we form when we 
recognize fundamental timths of science approaches 
very near in effect to the doctrine which in several works 
 have presented of fundamental ideas belonging to

eaeli acience and manifesting themselves in th axioma 
of the science it may bo observed however that by 
attempting to enumerate these ideas and axioms so as 
to lay the foundations of the whole body of h r ioal 
science and by endeavouring as far as osible to 
simplify apd connect each groii of such ideas 
have at least given a moro systematic form to this 
doctrine i have moreover traced it into many 
consequences to which it necessarily leads but which 
do not appear to have been contemplatefl by the meta 
physicians of the scotch scixl but i gladly acknow 
ledge my obligations to the writers of that school 
and i tnist tliat in the neai agreement of my views 
on such joints with theirs there is gi’ound for believ 
ing the system of philosophy which j have presented 
to ihj that to which the minds of thoughtful men 
who have meditated on such subjects are generally 
tending 

 as a further instance that such a tendency is 
at work i may make a quotation from an eminent 
english philosophical writer of another school “if 
you will be at the pains” says archbishop whately 
“ cai’efully to aiialyi the simplcht description you hear 
of any transaefion or stsite of things you will find that 
the process which almt invariably takes place is in 
logical language this that each individual has in his 
mind certain major premises or principles relative to 
the subject in question — that olservation of what 
actually presents itself to the scuises suplies minor 
reinihes and that the statement given and which is 
reported as a thing experienced consists in fact of 
the cwiclusions drawn from the combinations of these 
premises” the major premises hero spoken of are 
the fundamental ideas and the axioms and proposi 
tions to which they lead and whatever is regarded 
as a fact of observation is necessarily a conclusion in 
which those propositions are assum for these con 
taiu as we liave said the conditions of our experience 


• wliatcly miu econ y 




bbactior koalisrst sbnsariohists a 

onr experience conforms to these axioms and their 
consequences whether or not the connexion be stated 
in a logical manner by means of premises and a con 
elusion 

the same persuasion is also suggested by the 
course which the study of metahyics has taken of 
late years in france in that country as we have 
seen the sensational system which was conseied as 
the necessary consequence of the revolution begun by 
locke obtained a more complete ascendancy than it 
did in england and in that country too the reaction 
among metaphysical and moral avriters when its time 
came was more decided and rapid than it was among 
locke’s own countrymen it would appear thiit m 
laromiguidre was one of the firat to give expresaiem to 
this feeling of the necessity of a modiiication of the 
sensational philosophy ho began by professing him 
self the disciple of condillac even white he was almost 
unconsciously subverting the fundamental principles 
of that writer and thus as m cousin justly ob 
serves his opinions had the more powerful eflcct from 
being presented not as thwarting and contradicting 
but as sharing and following out the spiiit of hls age 
m laromigiiire’s work entitled jesmi mr les fa td 
its de vame consists of lectures given to the faculty 
of letters of the academy of paris in the yeais iii 
 and ill the views which these lectures 
present there is much which the author has in qpm 
mon with condillac but he is led by his investiga 
tion to assert® that it is not true that sensation is the 
sole fundamental element of our thoughts and our un 
derstanding attention also is requisite and here we 
have an element of quite another kind for sensation 
is passive attention is active attention does not 
spring out of sensation the passive principle is not 
the reason of the active principle activity and pas 
sivity are two facts entirely diffoieni nor can this 
activity bo defined or derived being as the author

bays a fundamental idea the distinction is manifest 
by its own nature and we may find evidence of it in 
the very forms of langutige to loot is more than to 
see to hearken is more than to hear the french 
language marks this distinction with respect to other 
senses also “ on voit et ton regarde on efrdmd et 
ton coute on sent et ton jlaire on godte et von 
savoure and thus the mere sensation or capacity 
of feeling is only the occasion on which the attention 
is exemsed wdifle the attention is the foundation of 
all the operations of tibe understanding 

the reader of my works will have seen how much 
i have insisted mipon the activity of the mind 
as the necessary basis of all knowledge in all ob 
servation and experience the mind is active and 
by its activity apprehends all sensations in subor 
dination to its own ideas and thus it becomes capa 
ble of collecting knowledge from phenomena since 
ideas involve general relations and connexions which 
sensations of themselves cannot involve and thus 
we see that in this respect also our philosophy 
stands at that point to which the speculations of the 
most reflecting men liavo of late constantly been 
verging 

 m cousin himself from whom we have quoted 
the above account of laromiguisre shares in this tend 
ency and has argued very energetically and success 
fully against the doctrines of the sensational school 
he has made it his ofilce once more to bring into 
notice among his countrymen the doctrine of ideas as 
the sources of knowledge and has revived the study 
of plato who may still be considered one of the 
great leaders of the ideal school but the larger 
portion of m cousin’s works refers to questions 
out of the reach of our present review and it would 
be unsuitable to dwell longer upon them in this 
placa 

 we turn to speculations more closely connected 
with our present subject m ampere a french man 
of science well entitled by his extensive knowledge 
and large and profound view to deal with the phuo

sophy of the sciences published in his £ssai mr 
la phuodophie des ikiencea ou exposkimi analytique 
cp um glaarificatum naiurelh de toutea lea connaiasancea 
huniainea in this remarkable work wo see strong 
evidence of the progress of the reaction against the 
system which derives our knowledge from sensation 
only the author starts from a maxim that in class 
ing the sciences we must not only regard the nature 
of the objects about which each science is conceiued 
but also the point of view uiidr which it considers 
them that is the ideas which each science involves 
m ampdre also gives briefly ids views of the intel 
lectual constitution of man a subject on which he 
had long and sedulously employed his thoughts and 
these views are far from belonging to the sensational 
school human thought he says is composed of phe 
nomena and of conceptions phenomena are extermil 
or sensitive and internal or active nceptions are 
of four kinds primitive as space and motion duration 
and cause objective as our idea of matter and sub 
stance ono natic or those which we associate with 
the general terms which language presents to us and 
explicative by which we ascend to causes after a com 
parative study of phenomena lie teaches further 
that in deriving ideas from sensation the mind is not 
passive but exerts an action which when voluntary 
is called attention but when it is tis it often is invo 
luntary may be teimed relation 

 shl not dwell upon the examination of these 
opinions but i may remark that both in the recog 
nition of conceptions as an original and essential ele 
ment of tho mind and in giving a prominent phice to 
the active function of tho mind in the oingin of our 
knowledge this view appimcbos to that wldoh i have

of the second and four of the third order thu§

without here criticizing iiieso ditibions or their prin 
ciple may observe tlnit cinenatiesy the doctrine of

it is a portion of knowledge which our investigiition 
lias led us also to see the necessity of erecting into 
a separate science and which wo have termed pure 
mechanism of the divisions of geology physical 
geography y especially as explained by m ampere is 
certainly a part of the subject both impoiiant and 
tolerably distinct from the rest geonomy contains 
what we have termed in the history descriptive oeo 
logy — the exhibition of the facts separate from the 
inquiry into their causes while our physical geology 
agrees with m ampere’s theory of the earth mms 
ralogy appears to be placed by mm in a different place 
from that which it occupies in our scheme but in 
fact he uscs the term for a diilbrent science he 
applies it to the classification not of simple mineralsy 
but of rochsy which is a science auxiliary to geology 
and which has sometimes been called petrology what 
we have termed mimralogyy m ampdre unites with 



reaction against sensationists 

chemistry ‘it belongs’ he says‘® chfemistiry 
and not to mineralogy to inquire how many atoms of 
sdlicium and of oxygen compose silica to tdl us that 
its primitive form is a rhombohedron of certain angles 
that it is called qtiartz bc leaving on one hand to 
molecular geometry the task of explaining the diet 
ent secondary forms which may result from the pri 
mitive form and on the other hand leaving to mine 
ralogy the office of describing the different vearietk of 
quartz and the rocks in which ihey dccur according 
as the quartz is crystallized transparent coloured 
amorphous solid or in sand jbut we may remark 
that by adopting this arrangement wc separate from 
mineralogy almost all the knowledge and absolutely 
all the general knowledge which books professing to 
treat of that science have usually contained the 
consideration of alincndogical classifications which 
as may be seen in the jlutory of science is so curious 
and insti’uctive is forced into the domain of chcinistiy 
although many of the persons who figure in it were 
not at all properly chemists and we lose in this 
way the advantage of that pecidiar office which in 
our arrangement mineralogy fills of forming a rigor 
ous transition from the sciences of classification to 
those which consider the mathematical properiies of 
bodies and connecting the external characters and 
the internal constitution of bodies by means of a system 
of important general truths i conceive therefore 
that our disposition of this science and our mode of 
applying the name are far more convenient than those 
of al ampere 

 we have seen the reaction against the pure sen 
sational doctrines operating very powerfully in england 
and in france but it was in germany that these 
doctrines wore most decidedly rejected and systems 
in extreme opposition to these put forih with confi

in the subject and not in the object the revolution 
in the customary moce of contemplating human know

it with the change produced by copernicus’s theory

anything concerning objects d priori by means of our

rience must be regulated by our conceptions 

lo this view of the nature of knowledge soon 
superseded entirely the doctrines of the sensational 
schoql among the metaphysicians of gerihany tliose 
philosophers did not gradually modify and reject the 
dogmas of locke and condillac as was done in england 
and france j nor did they endeavour to ascertain 
the extent of the empire of ideas by a cajeful survey 
of its several provinces as we have been doing in 
tliis series of works the german metaphysicians 
saw at once that ideas and things the subjective 
and the objective elements of our knowledge were 
by kant’s system brought into ojposition and cor 
relntion as equally ieal and equally indispensable 
seeing this they rushed at once to the highest 
and most difficult problem of philosophy — to deter 
mine what this correlation is — to discover how ideas 
and things are at the same time oipositc and iden 
tical — how the world wliilo it is distinct from and 
independent of us is yet iis an object of our know 
ledge govenied by the conditions of our thoughts 
the attempts to solve this problem taken in the widest 
sense including the forms which it assumes in morals 
politics the arts and religion as well as in the 
material sciences have since that time occupied the 
most profound speculators of germiuiy and have given 
rise to a number of systems which mpidly succeeding 
each other have each in its day been looked upon 
as a complete solution of the problem to trace the 
characters of these various systems does not belong

fubtheb advance of the sensational school 
m auguste comte 


i shall now take the liberty of noticing the views 
published by a contemporary writer not that it 
forms part of my design to offer any criticismr upon 
the writings of all those who have treated of those 
subjects on which we are now employed but because 
we can more distinctly in this manner point out the 
contibsts and ultimati tendencies of the several sys 
tems of opinion which have come under our smvey 
and since from among these systems we have endea 
voured to extract and secure the portion of truth 
which remains in esich and to reject the rest wc are 
led to oint out the errors on which our attention is 
thus fixed in recent as well as older writers 

m auguste comte published in the first and 
iu the second volume of his cours de philasophie 
positive of which the aim is not much different from 
that of the present work since as he states p viii 
such a title as the philosophy of the would 

describe a part of his object and would be inappro 
priate only by excluding that portion not yet pub 
lished whibh refers to speculations concerning social 
relations 

i comte on tlvree states of by em 

ploying the term philosophie positive he wishes to 
distinguish the philosophy involved in the present 
state of our sciences from die previous forma of human 
knowledge for according to him each branch f 
knowledge passes in the course of man’s history 
through three different states it is first theotoadly 
then metaphysical then positive by the latter term 



 philosophy op discovery 

he implies a state which includes nothing but general 
representations of facts — phenomena arranged accord 
ing to relations of succession and resemblance this 
 positive philosophy rejects all inquiry after causes 
which inquiry he holds to be void of sense and inac 
cessible all such conceptions belong to the meta 
physical ” state of science which deals with abstract 
forces real entities and the like still more completely 
does he reject as altogether antiquated and absurd 
the “theological” vjew of phenomena indeed he 
conceives that any one’s own consciousness of what 
passes within himself is suflicicnt to convince him of 
the truth of the law of the three phases through which 
knowledge must pass “ does not each of us” he 
says “in contemplating his own history recollect 
that he has been successively a theologian in his in 
fancy a rtietaphysician in his youth and a physicist in 
his ripe agel this may easily bo verified for all men 
who are up to the level of their time” 

it is plain from such statements and from the whole 
course of his work that m comte holds in their most 
rigorous form the doctrines to which the speculations 
of locke and his successors led and wliich tended 
as we have seen to the exclusion of all ideas except 
those of number and iosemblance as m comte 
refiises to admit into liis philosophy the fundamental 
idea of cause he of course excludes most of the other 
ideas which are as we endeavoured to show the 
foundations of science such as the ideas of media by 
which secondary qualities are made known to us the 
ideas of chemical attraction of polar forces and 
the like he would reduce all science to the mere 
expression of laws of phenomena expressed in formulee 
of spaded time and number and would condemn as 
unmeaning and as belonging to an obsolete state of 
science all endeavours to determine the causes of 
lhenomena or even to refer them to any of the other 
ideas just mentioned

 af comte rejects the search of canises — in 
a pluvious work have shown trust decisively 
that it is the genuine office of science to inquire 
into the causes as well as the laws of phenomena 
— that such an inquiry cannot be avoided and 
that it has been the source of almost all the science 
we possess i need not here repeat isie arguments 
there urged but may make a remark or two upon 
m comte’s hypothesis that all scien’c is first meta 
physical” and then “positive’ since it is in virtue 
of this hypothesis that ho rejects the iuvostigation of 
causes as worthy only of the infancy of science all 
discuasions concerning ideas m comte would condemn 
as “ metaphysical” and would consider as mere pre 
ludes to positive philosophy now i venture to assert 
on the contrary that discussions concerning ideas and 
rial discoveries liave in dvery science gone hand in 
hand there is no science in which the pretended 
order of things can be pointed out tliere is no science 
in which the discoveries of the laws of phenomena 
when once begun have bem carried on independently 
of discussions concerning ideas there is no scicknee 
in which the expression of the laws of phenomena can 
at this time dispense with ideas which have acquired 
their place in science in virtue of metaphysical con 
sidemtions there is no science in which the most 
active disquisitions concerning ideas did not come 
aftevy not before the first discovery of laws of pheno 
mena in astronomy the discoveiy of the pheno 
menal laws of the epicyclical motions of the heavens 
led to assumptions of tho metaphysical principle of 
equable circular motions kepler’s discoveries would 
never have been made but for his metaphysical notions 
these discoveries of the laws of phenomena did not 
lead immediately to newton’s theoiy became a century 
of metaphysical discussions was requisite as a prepa 
 ration newton then discovered not merely a law 
of phenomena but a came and ijwrefore he was the

philosophy op discovey 


greatest of discoverers the same is the case in op 
tics the ancients possessed some share of our know 
ledge of facts but meddled little with the metaphy 
sical reasonings of the subject in modem times 
when men began to inquire into the natwre of light 
they soon extended their knowledge of its laws when 
this series of discoveries had come to a pause a new 
series of brilliant discoveries of laws of phenoinena 
went on inseparably connected with a new series of 
views of the nature and cause of light in like man 
ner the most modem discoveries in chemistry involve 
indispensably the idea of polar forces the metaphy 
sics in m comte’s sense of each subject advances in 
a paiallel line with the knowledge of physical laws 
the explication of conceptions must go on as we 
have already shown at the same rate as the colligation 
of facts 

m comte will say that kewton’s discovery of 
gravitation only consists in exhibiting the astronomical 
phenomena of the universe as one single fact under 
different points of view but this fact involves the 
idea of force that is of cmiae and that this idea 
is not a mere modification of the idas of time and 
simce we have shown if it were so how could it 
lead to the axiom that attraction is mutual an indis 
pensable part of the newtonian theory m comte 
says® that we do not know what attraction is since wo 
can only define it by identical phrases but this is just 

true of space or time or motion and is in fact 
exactly the characteristic of a fundamental idea we 
do not obtain such ideas froth definitions but we possess 
them not the less truly because we cannot define 
them 

that m comte’s hypothesis is historically false is 
dbvious by such examples as i have mentioned meta 
physiciled discussions have been essential steps in the 
progress of each science if we arbitrarily reject all 
these portions of scientific history as useless trifling

bcilonging to the first rude attempts at knowledge we 
shall not only distort the progress of things but per 
vert the plainest cts of this we have an example 
in m comte’s account of kepler’s mechanical specu 
lations we have seen in the history of physical 
astronomy that kepler’s second law that the planets 
describe areas about the sun prportional to the times 
wa proved by him by means of calculations founded 
on the observivtions of ‘tycho but that the mechani 
cal reason of it was not assigned till a later period 
when it appeaied as the first proposition of newton’s 
phneipia it is plain from the writings of kepler 
that it was impossible for him to show how this law 
resulted from the forces which were in action since 
the forces which he considered were not those tending 
to the eentre which ieally determine the property in 
uehtioii but forces exeiiied by the sun in tlte direction 
of the planefa motion without which forces kepler 
conceived that the motion could not go on in short 
tlie state of mechanical science in kepler’s time was 
such that no demonstration of the law could be given 
the terms in which such a demonstration must be 
expressed had not at that time acquired a precise 
significance and it was in virtue of many subsequent 
metaphysical discussions as m comte would teim 
them that these terms became capable of expressing 
sound mechanical retisoning kepler did indeed pre 
tend to assign what he called a ‘‘physical proof” of 
his law depending upon this that the sun’s force is 
less at greater distances a condition which does liot 
at all influence the iesult thus kepler’s reason for 
his law proves nothing but the confusion of thought in 
which he was involved on such aubjectfe vet m comte 
assigns to kepler the credit of having proved this law 
by sound mechanical reasoning as well as established 
it as a matter of fact “ this discovery by kepler’

he adds the more remarkable inasmuch as it oc 
curred before the science of dynamics had really been 
created by galileo” we may remark that inasmuch 
as m comte perceived this incongruity in the facta as 
he stated them it is the more remaikable that he did 
not examine them more carefully 

 causes m physics — the condemnation of the 
inquiry into causes which is conveyed in m conte’s 
notion of the three stages of science ho again ex 
presses more in detail in stating’ what he calls his 
fundatmutal theory of hypotheses this “tlieory” is that 
we may employ hypotheses in our natuml philosophy 
but these hyiotheses must always be such as admit of 
a positive verification we must have no suppositions 
concerning the agents by which effects are produced 
all such suppositious have an antisciciitihc charac 
ter and can only impede the real progress of physics 
there can bo no use in the ethers and imaginary fluids 
to which some persons refer the phenomena of heat 
light electricity and magnetism and in agreement 
with this doctrine m uomte in his account® of the

science of optics condemns as utterly unphiloso 
phioal and absurd both the theory of emission and 
that of undulation 

to this we reply that theory of one kind or other 
is indispensable to the expression of the phenomena 
and that when the laws are expressed and apparently 
explained by means of a theory to forbid us to in 
juire whether it be really true or false is a pedantic 
and capricious limitation of our knowledge to which 
the intellect of man neither can nor should submit 
if any one holds the adoption of one or other of these 
theories to be indifferent let him express the laws of 
jihenomenio of diffraction in terms of the theory of 
emission‘s if any one rejects the doctrine of undula 
tion let him point out some other way of connecting 
double refraction with polarization and surely no 
man of science will contend that the beautiful branch 
of science which refers to that connexion is not a 
portion of our positive knowledge 

m comte’s contempt for tjie speculations of the 
uiidulationists seems to have prevented his acquainting 
himself with their reasonings and even with the laws 
of phenomena on which they have reasoned although 
these form by fiir the most striking and beautiful 
addition which science has received in modern times 
he adduces as an insuperable objection to the undu 
latory theory a difficulty which is ftilly removed by 
calculation in every wrk on the subject — the ex 
istence of shadow he barely mentions the subject of 
diffraction and young’s law of interferences — speaks 
of fresnel as having applied this principle to the 
phenomena of coloured rings on which the ingenious 
labours of newton left much to desire” as if fresnel’s 
labours on this subject had been the supplement of 
those of newton and after regretting that ‘‘this 
principle of interferences has not yet been distinctly

disentangled from chemical conceptions n the nature 
of light concludes his chapter he does not even 
mention the phenomena of dipolarization of circular 
and elliptical polarization or of the optical properties 
of crystals discoveries of laws of phenomena quite as 
remarkalde aa any which can be mentioned 

m comte’s favourite example of ihysical research 
is therinotias and especially fourier’s researches with 
regard to heat it is shown” in the history of ther 
motics that the general phenomena of raation re 
quired the assumption of a fluid to ‘express them 
as appears in the theory of exchanges and the ex 
planation of the principal laws of radiation which 
fourier gives depends upon the conception of material 
molecular radiation the flux of caloiic of which 
fourier speaks cannot be conceived otherwise than as 
impl dng a material flow m comte apologizes for 
this expression as too figurative and says that it 
merely indicates a faxt but wliat is the flow of a 
current of fluid except a fact and is it not evident 
that without such expressions and the ideas corre 
sponding to them fourier could neither have conveyed 
nor conceived his tlieoryl 

in concluding this discussion it must bo recollected 
that though it is a most narrow and untenable rule to 
say that we will admit no agency of ethers and fluids 
into philohoihy yet the redity of such agents is only 
to be held in the way and to the extent which the 
laws of phenomena indicate it is not only allowable 
but inevitable to assume as the vehicle of heat and 
light a medium jossessing some of the properties of 
more familiar kinds of matter but the idea of such 
a medium which we possess and on which we cannot 
but reason can be fully developed only by an assi 
duous study of the cases in which it is applicable it 
may be that as science advances all our knowledge 
nay conveige to one general and single aspect of the

universe we abandon and reject this hope if vre 
refiise to admit those ideas which must be our step 
pingstones in advancing to such a point and wo no 
less frustrate such an expectation if we allow ourselves 
to imagine that from our present position we can stride 
at once to the summit 

 games in other sciences — but if it is in the 
sciences just mentioned impracticable to reduce our 
knowledge to laws of phenomena ahno without refer 
ring to causes medio and other agencies how much 
more plainly is it impossible to confine our thoughts 
to phenomena and to laws of succession and resem 
blance in other sciences as chemistry physiology and 
geology who shall forbid us or why should we be 
ibrbidden to inquire wliether chemical and galvanic 
forces are identical whether instability is a peculiar 
vital power wlietlier geological causes have been uni 
fonu or paroxysmal to exclude sucli inquiries would 
be to secure ourselves from tlie poison of error by 
abstaining from the banquet of truth — at would bo to 
attempt to feed our minds with the meagre diet of 
space and number because we may find too delightful 
a relish in such matteis os cause and end symmetry 
and afiiiiity organization and development 

thus m oomtes arrangement of the progress of 
science as successively metaphysical and iositive is 
contrary to history in fact and contraiy to sound phi 
losophy in principle nor is there any better founda 
tion for his statement that tlieologicol views are to be 
found only in the rude infantine condition of human 
knowledge and vanish as science advances even in 
material sciences this is not the case we have shown 
in the chapter on final causes that physiologists have 
been directed in their remarks by the conviction of a 
purpose in every part of the structure of animals and 
that this idea which had its rise after the first obser 
vations has gone on constantly gaining strength and 
clearness so that it is now the basis of a large portion 
of the science we have seen too in the on the 
paleetiological sciences that the researches of that class 
do by no means leal ts to reject an origin of the series 



 


philosophy op discovery 


of events nor to suppose this origin to be included in 
the series of natural laws science has not at all 
shown any reason for denying either the creation or 
the purpose of the universe 

this is true of those aspects of the universe which 
have become the subjects of rigorous science but how 
small a portion of the whole do they form especially 
how minute a proportion does our knowledge bear to 
cur iguoiance if we admit into science as m comte 
advises only the laws of phenomena even in the 
best explored fields of science how few such laws do 
we know meteorology climate teites trial magnetism 
the colours and other propertias of bodies the con 
ditions of musical and articulate sound and a thou 
sand other facts of physics are not defined by any 
known laws in physiology wo may readily convince 
ourselves how little we know of laws since we c 
hardly study one species without discovering some un 
guessed property or apply the microscope without 
seeing some new structure in the best known organs 
and when we go on t social and moral and political 
matters we may well doubt whether any one single 
rigorous rule of phenomena has ever been stated al 
though on such subjects man’s ideas have been busily 
and eagerly working ever sinco his origin what a 
wanton and baseless assumption it would be then to 
reject those suggestions of a governor of the universe 
which we derive from man’s moral and spiritual ns 
ture and from the institutions of society because we 
fiincy we see in the small field of our existing “ positive 
knowledge” a tendency to exclude “ theological views” 
because we can explain the motion of the stars by a 
general law which seems to imply no liyperphysical 
agency and can trace a few more limited laws in 
other properties of matter we are exhorted to rect 
convictions irresistibly suggested to us by our boes 
and our souls by histoiy and antiquities by conscience 
aiid human law 

 m practical philosophy — it is not 

merely as a speculative doctrine that m comte urges 
the necessity of our thus following the guidance of 



m augcste comte 


 


‘positive philosophy” the fevered and iwolutionary 
condition of human societyat present arises according 
to him from the simultaneous employment of three 
kinds of philosophy radically incompatible — theolo 
gical metaphysical and positive philosophy the 
remedy for the evil is to reject the two former and to 
iefer everything to that positive philosophy of which 
the destined triumph cannot be doubtful in like 
manner our european education still essentially 
theological metaphysical and literary must be re 
placed by a positive education suited to tlie spirit of 
our epocl 

with these practical consequences of m comte’s 
philosophy we are not here concerned but the notice 
of them may serve tc show how entirely the rejection 
of the theological view peiwades his system and how 
closely this rejection is connected with the principles 
whicllead him also to reject the fundamental ideas of 
the sciences as we have presented them 

 m conue on hypotheses — in the detail of 
m comte’s work i do not find any peculiar or novel 
remarks on the induction by which the sciences are 
formed except we may notice as such his permission 
of hypotheses to the inquirer already referred to 
“there can only be” ho says® “two general modes 
fitted to reveal to us in a direct and entirely rational 
manner the true law of any phenomenon — either the 
immediate analysis of this phenomenon or its exact 
and evident relation to some more extended law pre 
viously established — in a woid induction or deduc 
tion but both these ways would certainly be insuf 
ficient even with regard to the simplest phenomenon 
in the eyes of any one who fully comprehends tlie 
essential difficulties of the intimate study of nature if 
we did not often begin by anticipating the result and 
making a provisory supposition at first essentially 
conjectural even with respect to some of the notions 
which constitute the final object of inquiry henbe

the introduction which is strictly indispensable of 
hypotheses in natural philoaophy” we have already 
seen that the “ permissio intellectus” had been noticed 
as a requisite step in discovery as long before as the 
time of bacon 

 m gonitis gldssijication of sciences — i do not 
think it necessary to examine in detail m comte’s 
views of the philosophy of the different sciences but 
it may illustrate the object of the present work to 
make a remark upon his attempt to establish a distinc 
tion between physical and chemical science this dis 
tinction he makes to cotisist in three points — that 
physics considers general and chemistry special pro 
perties — that physics considers masses and chemistry 
molecules — that in physics the mode of arrangement 
of the molecules remains constant while in chemistry 
this airangement is necessarily altered m comte 
however allows that these lines of distinction arevague 
and insecure for among many others magnetism a 
special property belongs to physics and breaks down 
his first criterion and molecular attractions are a con 
stant subject of speculation in physics so that the 
second distinction cannot be insisted on to which 
we may add that the greater portion of chemistiy does 
not attend at all to tiie arrangement of the molecules 
so that the third character is quite erroneous the 
real distinction of these branches of science is as we 
have seen the fundamental ideas which they employ 
physics deals with relations of space time and num 
ber media and scales of qualities according to intens 
ity and other differences while chemistry has for its 
subject elements and attractions as shown in compo 
sition and polarity though in different senses belongs 
to both the failure of this attempt of m comte at dis 
tinguishing these provinces of science by their objects 
may be looked upon as an illustration of the impossi 
bility of establishing a philosophy of the sciences on 
any other ground tlmn the ideas which they involva

we have thus traced to its extreme poinl so r as 
thenature of science is concerned one of those two 
antagonistic opinions of which the struggle began in 
the outset of philosophy and has continued during tlio 
whole of her progress — namely the opinions which 
respectively make our sensations and our ideiis the 
origin of our knowledge the foimer if it be consist 
ent with itself must consider all knowledge of causes 
as impossible since no sensation cart give us the idea 
of cause and when this opinion is applied to science 
it reduces it to the mere investigation of laws of phe 
nomena according to relations of space time and 
number i purposely abstain as far as possible from 
the consideiation of the other consequences not strictly 
lelonging to the physical sciences which were drawn 
from the doctrine that all our ideas aie only trans 
formed sensations the mateiialism the atheism the 
sensualist morality the anarchical polity which some 
of the disciples of the sensational scljool erected upon 
the fundamental dogmas of their sect do not belong to 
our present subject and are matters too avcighty to be 
treated of as mere accessones 


the above remarks were written before i had seen 
the third volume of m comte’s work or the subse 
quent volumes but i do not find in anything w’hich 
those volumes contain any giound for altering what 
have written indeed they are occupied altogether 
with subjects which do not come within the field of my 
present speculations

t he history of tie inductive sciences was pub 
liblied in and the philosophy of the indu 
tire sciences in in mr mill published liis 
system of logic in which he states that without the 
aid derivol fiom the facts and ideas in my volumes 
the corresponding portion of his own would most pro 
bably not have been written and quotes parts of wliat 
i have said with commendation he also however 
dissents from me on several important and funda 
mental points and argues against what have said 
thereon conceive that it may tend to bring into a 
clearer liglit the doctrines which i have tried to estab 
lish and the truth of them if i discuss some of the 
differences between us which i shall proceed to do 

mr mills work has had for a work of its abstruse 
character a circulation so extensive and admirers so 
numerous and so fervent that it needs no commenda 
tion of mine but if my main concern at present bad 
not been with the ixjints in which mr mill differs 
from me should have had great pleasure in pointing 
out passages of which there are many in which mr 
mill appears to me to have been very happy in pro 
moting or in expressing philosophical truth 

there is one portion of his work indeed which 
tends to give it an interest of a wider kind than be

hr mill’s logic 


 

lorgs to that merely scientific truth to which i pur 
osely and resolutely confined my speculations in the 
works to which i have referred mr mill has intro 
duced into his work a direct and extensive considera 
tion of the modes of dealing with moral and political 
as well as physical questions and i have no doubt 
that this part of his book has for many of his readers 
a more lively interest than any other such a com 
prelionsive scheme seems to give to doctiinca respect 
ing science a value and a purpose winch they cannot 
have so long as they are restricted to mere material 
sciences i still retain the opinion however upon 
which i formerly acted that the philosophy of science 
is to be extracted from the portions of slience which 
are universally allowed to be most certainly estab 
lislied and that those are the physical sciences am 
very far from saying or thinking that there is no 
such thing as moral and political science or that no 
method can be suggested for its promotion but 
think that hy attempting at present to include the 
moral sciences in the same humulfe with the phy 
sical we open far more controversies than we close 
and that iu the moral as in the jhysical sciences the 
first step towards showing how truth is to be disco 
vered is to study some portion of it which is assented 
to so as to be beyond controversy 

 what is induction — i confining myself then 
to the material sciences i shall proceed tt ofler my 
remarks on induction with especial refeience to mr 
mill’s work and in order that we may as i have 
said proceed as intelligibly as possible let us begin 
by considering what we mean by induction as a mode 
of obtaining truth and let us note whether there is 
any difference between mr mill and me on this sub 
ject 

for the purposes of the present inquiry” mr mill 
• says l ‘ “induction may be defined the opersi

iezoept when otherwise expressed to first cdillou of his xogie

tion of discoyering and forming general propositions 
meaning as appears by the context the discovery of 
them from paiticular facts he dsewhere i 
terms it generalization from experience and again 
he speaks of it with greater precision as the inference 
of a more general proposition from less general ones 

 now to these definitions and descriptions i 
assent as far os they go though as i shall have to 
remark they appear to me to leave unnoticed a fea 
ture wldch is very imixrtant and which occurs in all 
cases of induction so far as we are concerned with it 
science then consists of general propositions inferred 
from particular facts or from less general propositions 
by induction and it is our object to discern the na 
ture and laws of induction in this sense that the 
propositions are general or arc more general than the 
facts from which they are inferred is an indispensable 
part of the notion of induction and is essential to any 
discussion of the process as the mode of arriving at 
science that is at a body of general truths 

 i am obliged theretbre to dissent from mr mill 
when he includes in his notion of induction the pro 
cess by which we arrive at ivdividual facts from other 
facts of tjie same order of particularity 

such inference is at any rate not induction alone 
if it be induction at all it is induction applied to an 
example 

for instance it is a general law obtained by in 
duction from particular facts that a body falling ver 
tically downvards from rest describes spaces propor 
tional to the squares of the times but that si par 
ticular body will fall through t feet in one second 
and feet in two seconds is not an induction simply 
it is iesult obtained by applying the inductive law 
to a jarticular case 

but further such a process is fiben hot induction 
at all that a ball striking another ball directly will 
dommunicate to it afi much menientiim as the striking 
ball itself loses is a law established by induction but 

from habit or practical skill i make one ttiliard 
ball strike another so as to produce the velocity which 



hr mills loqio 


 

i irish without knowing or thinking of the general 
the teim inductlcm cannot then be rightly ap 
plied if i haov the law and act upon it have in 
my mind both the general induction and its pailicular 
application but if i act by the ordinary billiard 
player’s skill without thinking of momentum or law 
there is no induction in the case 

 this distinction becomes of importance in re 
ference to mr mill’s doctrine becaiiso he has extended 
his use of the term induction not only to the oases in 
which the general induction is consciously applied to 
a particular instance but to the cases in which the 
particular instance is dealt with by means of expe 
rience in that rude sense in which experience can be 
asserted of brutes and in which of course we can in 
no way imagine that the law is possessed or under 
stood as a general proposition he has thus as i 
conceive overlooked the broad and essential difference 
between speculative knowledge and practical action 
and has introduced oases which are quite foreign to 
the idea of science alongside with coses from which 
we may hope to obtain some views of the nature of 
science and the prwesses by which it must be formed 

 thus ii he says “ tliis inference of ono 
particular fact from another is a case of induction 
it is of this sort of induction that brutes arc capable” 
and to the same purpose he had previously said i 
 “he the burnt child who shuns the fire is not 
generalizing he is inferring a particular from parti 
culars in the same way also brutes reason not 
only the burnt child but the burnt dog dreads the 
fire” 

 this confusion for such it seems to me of 
knowledge with piactical tendencies is expressed more 
iu detail in other places thus lie says i ‘i 
cannot dig the ground imless i have au idea of the 
ground and of a spade and of all the other things 
am operating upon” 

 this appears to ne to be a use of words whiclf 
only tend to confuse our idea of knowledge by ob 

uteriating all tiiat is distinctive iu human knowledge 

r 



 philosophy op discovery 

it seems to me quite false to say that i cannot dig the 
ground unless i have an idea of the ground and of my 
spade are we to say that we cannot walk the ground 
unless we have an idea of the ground and of our feet 
and of our shoes and of the muscles of our legs are 
wo to say tliat a mole cannot dig the ground unless 
he has an idea of the ground and of the snout and 
paws with which he digs it are we to say tliat a 
pholas cannot iiorforate a rock unless he have an idea 
of the rock and of the acid with which he corrodes it 

 this appears to me as i liavc said to be a line 
of speculation which can leiul to nothing but confusion 
the knowledge concern iiig which i wish to incuire is 
huimin knowledge and in order that i may have 
any chance of success in the inquiry i find it neces 
sary to single out that kind of knowledge which is 
especijilly and distinctively huniau hence i pass by 
in tins part of my investigation all the knowledge il‘ 
it is to be so called which man has in no other way 
than brutes have it — ail that merely shows itself in 
action for though action may be modified by habit 
and habit by experience in animals as well as in men 
such experience so long as it retains that merely prac 
tical form is no part of the materials of science 
knowledge in a general form is alone knowledge fur 
that purpose j and to that therefore must confine 
my attention at least till i have made some progress 
in ascertaining its nature and laws and am thus prf 
pared to compare such knowledge — human knowledge 
properly so called — with mere animal tendencies to 
action or even with practical skill which does not 
include as for the most part practical skill does not 
include speculative knowledge 

 and thus i accept mr mill’s definition of in 
duction only in its first and largest form and reject 
as useless and mischievous for our purposes his exten 
sion of the term to the practical influence which expo 
nence of one fact exercises upon a creature dealing 
with similar facts such influence cannot be iesolved 
into ideas and induction without as i conceive mak 
ing all our subsequent investigahou vague and hete 



mr mills logic 


 


rogeneous indefinite and inconclusive if we must 
speak of animals as learning from experience we may 
at least abstain from applying to them terms which 
imply that they learn in the same way in which men 
learn astronomy from the stars and chemistiy from 
the effects of mixture and heat and tlie same may 
be said of the language which is to be used concerning 
what mn learn wlien their learning merely shows 
itself in action and does not exist as a geneial tjiought 
induction must iut be applbni to such cases induc 
tion milst be coufined to cases where we hiive in our 
minds general propositions in oider that the sci 
ences which are our most instructive examples of the 
process we have to consider may be in any definite 
and proper sense inductive sciences 

 perhaps some persons may be inclined to say 
that this difference of opinion sis to the extent of 
meaning which is to be given to the term induct ion y 
is a question merely of words a matter of definition 
only this is a mode in which men in our time often 
seem inclined to dispose of philosoidiieal questions 
thus evading the tsisk of forming an opinion upon such 
questions while they retain the air of looking at the 
subject from a more comprehensive point of view 
but as i have elsewliere said such questions of defini 
tion are never questions of tion merely a pro 
position is always imidied along with the dofinitioii 
and the truth of the proposition depends upon the 
settlement of the definition ihis is tlie case in the 
present instance we are speaking of hidtictmn and 
we mean that kind of induction by which the sciences 
now existing ammg men have been constructed on 
this account it is that we cannot include in the mean 
ing of the term mere piactical tendencies or practical 
habits for science is not constructed of these no 
accumulatiou of these would make up any of tlie ac 
•knowledged sciences the elements of such science 
are something of a kind different from practical habits 
the elements of such sciences are principles which we 
imow truths which can be contemplated as being 
true praotioal habits practical skill instincts and 



 


philosophy of discovert 


tbe like appear in action and in action only such 
endowments or acquirements show themselves when 
the occasion for action arrives and then show them 
selves in the act without being put or being capable 
of being put in the form of truths contemplated by tho 
intellect but the elements and mateiials of science 
are necessary truths contemplated by the intellect tt 
is by consisting of such elements and such materials 
that science ia science hence a use of the term in 
duction which requires us to obliterate this distinction 
must make it impossible for us to annve at any con 
sistent and intelligible view of the nature of science 
and of the mental jirocess by which sciences come into 
being wo must for the juirpose which mr mill and 
i have in common retain his larger and more philo 
sophical definition of induction — that it is tlfo infer 
ence of a more general proposition from less general 
ones 

i r perhaps again some persons may say that 
practical skill and ractical experience lead to science 
and may therefore be included in the term indactiouj 
which lescribes the formation of science but to this 
we reply that these things lead to science as occasions 
only and do not form jart of science and that sci 
ence begins then only wlien we look at tho facts in a 
general point of view tliis distinction is essential to 
the philosophy of science the ropedancer may by 
his perfonnances suggest to himself or to others pro 
perties of the center of gravity but this is so because 
man has a tendency to speculate and to think of gene 
ral truths as well as a tendency to dance on a rope on 
special occasions and to acquire skill in such dancing 
by practice the ropedancer docs not dance by in 
duction any more than the dancing dog does to 
apply the terms science and induction to such cases 
carries us into the regions of metaphor as when wo 
all birds of passage wise meteorologists” or tho bee 
“a natural chemist who turns the flowerdust into 
honey” this is very well in poetry but for our pur 
poses we must avoid recognizing these cases as retilly 
belonging to the sciences uf meteorology and chemis

try — as really cases of induction induction for us 
is geneml propositions contempicued as such derived 
from particulars 

science may result ro exrerience and observation 
hy induction j but induction is not thei’efore the same 
thing as experience and observation induction is 
experience or observation consdomly looked at in a 
yeneral form this consciousness and ffpiierality arc 
necessary parts of that knowledge which is science 
and accordingly on the other hand science cannot 
losult from inoio instinct as distinguished from rea 
son because instinct by its nature is not conscious 
and general but operattis blindly and unconsciously in 
aiiicuhir cases the actor not seeing or thinking of 
the riilj which lie obeys 

 a little further on i shall endtavonr to show 
that not only a general thought but a general loord or 
phrase is a requisite element in induction this doc 
trine of course still more decidedly excludes the ciise 
of animals ami of mere practical knowledge in man 
a burnt child dreads the fire but reason must be 
unfolded before the child learns to understand the 
words ‘‘ ire will hurt you” tlie burnt dog never 
thus icarus to imdcrshind words and this difference 
points to an entirely different state of thought in the 
two cases or rather to a difference betveen a state of 
rational thought on the one hand and of mere prac 
tical instinct the other 

 besides this difference of speculative thought 
and practical instinct which thus are as appears to me 
confounded in mr mill’s philosophy in such a way as 
tends to destroy all coherent views of human know 
ledge there is another set of cases to which mr mill 
applies the term induhion and to which it appears to 
me to be altogether inapplicable he employs it to 
describe the mode in which supeistitious men in igno 

• rant ages were led to tlie opinion that striking natu 
ral events presaged or accompanied calamities thus 
he says i “ the opinion so long prevalent that 
a comet or any other unusual appearance in the 
heavenly regions was the precursor of calamities to 



 philosophy of discovery 

mankind or at least to those who witnessed it the be 
lief ill the omcles of delphi and dodona the reliance 
on astrology or on the weatherprophecies in almanacs 
were doubtless inductions supposed to be grounded on 
experience and he speaks of these insuflicient induc 
tions being extinguished by the stronger inductions 
subsequently obtained by scientific inquiry and in 
like manner he says in another acc i “ lot us 
now compare different predictions the first that 
eclipses will occur whenever one planet or satellite is 
so situated as to cast its shadow upon another the 
second that they will occur whenever some great 
calamity is impending over mankind” 

 n’ow i cannot see how anything but confusion 
can arise from applying the term induction to super 
stitious fancies like those here mentioned they are 
not imperfect truths but entij’c falsehoods of that 
mr mill and i are agreed how then can they ex 
emplify the progress towards truth they were not 
collected from the feefcs by seeking a law of their 
occurrence but were suggested by an imagination of 
the anger of superior powers shown by such deviations 
from the ordinary course of nature if we are to jeak 
of inductions to any purikise they must be such induc 
tions as represent the fkctis iu some degree at least 
it is not meant i presume that these opinions iue in 
any degree true to what purjkwse then are they ad 
duced if i were to hold that my dreams predict or 
conform to the motions of the stars or of the clouds 
would this be an induction it would be so as much 
one as those here so denominated yet what hut con 
fusion could arise from classing it among scientific 
truths mr mill himself has explained ii the way 
in which such delusions as the proplieoies of almanac 
makers and the like obtain credence namely by the 
greater effect which the positive instances produce on 
ordinary minds in comparison with the negitive when 
the rule has once taken possession of their thoughts 
and this being as he says the recognized explanation 
of such cases why should we not leave them to their 
due place and not confound and perplex the whole of 



mr mill’s logic 


 

our investigation by elevating them to the rank of 
‘‘inductions” the very condemnation of such opinions 
is that they are not at all inductive when we have 
made any progress in our investigation of the nature 
of science to attempt to drive us back to the weari 
some discussion of such elementary jxint as these is 
to make progress hopeless 

ij inductiofi or deficription — if in the cases 
hitherto noticed mr mill extends the term judiictiony 
as i think too widely and applies it to cases to which 
it is not rightly applicable i have now to notice a 
case of an opposite kind in which he does not apply it 
where i do and condemns me for using it in such 
a case i had spoken of kepler’s discovery of the 
law thpt tlie planets move round the sun in ellipses 
as an example of induction the separate facts of any 
planet mars for instance being in certain places at 
certain times are all included in the general proposi 
tion which kepler discovered that mars describes an 
ellipse of a certain form and position this appears to 
me a very simple bufc a very distinct example of the 
operation of discovering general propositions general 
that is with reference to particular facts which opera 
tion mr mill as well as myself says is induction but 
mr mill denies this operation in this case to be induc 
tion at all i i should not have been prepared 
for this denial by the previous parts of mr mill’s book 
for he had said just before i “such facts as the 
magnitudes of the bodies of the solar system their 
disncos from each other the figure of the earth and 
its rotation are proved indirectly by the aid of in 
ductions founded on other facts which we can more 
easily reich” if the figure of the earth and its rota 
tion are proved by induction it seems very strange 
and is to me quite incomprehensible how the figure of 
the earth’s orbit and its revolution and of course of 
• the figure of mars’s orbit and his revolution in like 
manner are not also proved by induction no says 
mr mill kepler in putting together a numler of 
places of the planet into one figure only performed an 
act of descriptim “this descriptive operation” he 



 philosophy of discovery 

adds i ‘‘mr whewell by an aptly chosen ex 
pression has termed colligation of facts he goes 
on to commend my observations concerning this pro 
cess but says that according to the old and received 
meaning of the term it is not induction at ali 

 now i have already shown that mr mill him 
selfi a few pages earlier had applied the term induction 
to cases undistinguishable from this in any essential 
circumstance and even in this case he allows that 
kepler did really perform an act of induction i 
“namely in concluding that because the observed 
places of mars were correctly representel by points in 
an imaginary ellipse therefore mais would continue to 
revolve in that same ellipse and even in concluding 
that the position of the planet during the time which 
had intervened between the two observations must 
have coincided with the intermediate points of the 
curve of course in keplers induction of which i 
speak i include all this all this is included in sieak 
ing of the orbit of mais a continuous lino a periodical 
motion are implied in the term orbit i am unable to 
see what would remain of keplers discovery if we 
take from it these conditions it would not only not 
be an induction but it would not be a description for 
it would not recognize that mars moved in an orbit 
are particular positions to be conceived as points in a 
curve without thinking of the intermediate positions 
as belonging to the samo curve if so there is no law 
at all and the facts are not bound together by any 
intelligible tie 

in another jdace ii mr mill returns to his 
distinction of description and induction but without 
throwing any additional light upon it so r as i can 
see 

 the only meaning which i can discover in this 
attempted distinction of description and induction is 
that when particular facts are bound together by their 
relation in space mr mill calls the discovery of the 
connexion description but when they are ccnnected 
y other general relations as time cause and the like 
mr mill terms the discovery of the connexion induc’ 



mr mills logic 


 

tion and this way of making a distinction would 
fall in with the doctrine of otiior parts of mr milfs 
hook in which he ascribes very peculiar attributes to 
space and its relations in comparison with other ideas 
as should call them but i cannot see any ground 
for this distinction of cnnexion according to space 
and other connexions of facts 

to stand upon such a distinction appears to me to 
be the may to miss the general law ot the formation 
of science for example the ancients discovered 
that the planets revolved in recurring periods and 
thus connected tlic observations of their motions ac 
cording to the idea of kejder discovered that 

tlioy revolved in ellipses and thus connected the ob 
servations according to the idea of space newton 
discovered that they revolved in virtue of the hun’s 
attraction and thus connecti‘d the motions according 
to the idea of force the first and tliird of these dis 
coveries are recognized on all hands as processes of 
induction why is the second to be called bj a dif 
ferent name or wliat but confusion and perplexity 
can arise from refusing to class it with the other two 
it is you say description but such description is a 
kind of induction and must be spoken of as induction 
if wo are to speak of induction as the process by which 
hcieiicc is formed for the three steps are all the 
second in the same sense as the first and third in 
coordination with them steps in the formation of 
astronomical science 

r but says mr mill i ‘‘it is a faot surely 
that the planet does describe an elliise and a fact 
which we could see if we had adequate visual organs 
and a suitable position” to this i should reply “ let 
it be so and it is a fact surely that the planet does 
move periodically it is a fact surely that the planet 
is attracted by the sun still therefore the asserted 
distinction fails to find a ground” perhaps mr mjll 
would remind us that the elliptical form of the orbit is 
a fact which we could see if we had adequate visual 
organs and a suitable position but that force is a 
thing which we cannot see but this distinction also 



 


philosophy of discovert 


will not bear handling can we not see a tree blown 
down by a storm or a rock blown up by gunpowder 
do we not here force — see it tliat is by its cflects 

the only way in which wo need to see it in the case 
of a planet tor the purposes of our argument are 
not such operations of force facts which may be 
the objects of sense and is not the operation of the 
sun’s force a fact of the same kind just as much as 
the elliptical form of orbit which results from the 
actitm if the latter be ‘surely a fact” the former 
ls a fact no less surely 

t in trutli as i have repeatedly had occasion to 
remark all attempts to frame an argument by the 
exclusive or emphatic aijffoinlation of the term fact 
to particular cases are necessarily illusory and incon 
clusive there is no definite and stable distinction 
between facts and theories facts and laws facts 
and inductions inductions laws theories which 
are true are facts facts involve inductions it is 
a fact that the moon is attracted by the earth just as 
much as it is a fact that an apple falls from a tree 
that the former fact is collected by a more distinct 
and conscious induction does not make it the less 
a fact that the orbit of mars is a fact — a true 
description of the path — does not make it the less 
a case of induction 

 there is another argument which mr mill 
employs in order to show that there is a difference 
between mere colligation which is description and in 
duction in the more proper sense of lilie term he 
notices with conunendation a remark which i had 
made i that at different stages of the progress 
of science the facts had been successfully connected by 
means of very different condeptions while yet the later 
conceptions have not contradicted but included so r 
as they were true the earlier thus the andent oreek 
rresentation of the motions of the planets by means 
 epicycles and eccratnes was to a certain degree of 
accuracy true and is not negatived though superseded 
by the modem representation of the planets as describ 
ing ellipses round the sun and he then reasons that 



mr mill’s logic 


 


this which is thus tnie of descriptions cannot he true 
of inductions he says i “different descrip 
tions tiiercfore may be all time but surely not different 
explanations ” he then notices the various explana 
tions of the motions of the planets — the ancient doc 
trine that they are moved by an hihcreiit virtue the 
cartesian doctrine that they are nived by impulse and 
ly vortices the newtonian doctrine that they are 
governed by a central force and he adds “can it be 
hjiid of these as wiis said of the different descriptions 
tliat they are all true as far as they go is it not 
true that one only can be true in any degree and thsit 
the other two must be altogether false” 

 and to this questioning the history of science 
compels me to rejdy very distinctly and positively in 
the way which mr mill appears to think extrava 
gant and absurd i am obliged to say ttndoubtedlv 
all these explanations nmy be true and consistent with 
each other and would be so if each hati been followed 
out so as to show in what manner it could c made 
consistent with the facts and this was in reality 
in a great measure donc the doctrine that the 
heavenly bodies were moved by vortices was succes 
sively modified so that it came to coincide in its 
results with the doctrine of an inversequatlratic centri 
petal force as i have remarked in the history when 
this point was reached the vortex was merely a 
machinery well or ill devised for producing such a 
centripetal force and therefoim did not contradict the 
doctrine of a centripetal force newton himqelf does 
not appear to have been averse to explaining gravity 
by impulse so little is it true that if the one theory be 
true the other must be false the attempt to explain 
gravity by the impulse of streams of particles ffowing 
through the universe in all directions which i have men 
tioned in the philosophy is so far from being inoon

siatent with the newtonian theory that it is founded 
entirely upon it and even with regard to the doctrine 
that the heavenly ijodiea move by an inherent virtue 
if this doctrine had been maintained in any such way 
that it was brought to agree with the facts the in 
herent virtue must have had its laws determined and 
then it would liave been found that the virtue had a 
reference to the central body and so the “ inherent 
virtue” must liave coincided in its elfect with the 
newtonian force and then the two explanations 
would agree except so far as the word “ hdicrcnt” 
was concerned and if such a jjart of an earlier theory 
as this word inherent indicates is found to be unten 
able it is of cjoursg rejected in the transition to later 
and more exact tlieories in jiidiictions of this kind 
as well as in what mr mill calls descriptions tlitjre 
is tlicrefore still no validity discoverable in the dis 
tinction which mr mill attempts to draw between 
“descriptions” like kepler’s law of elliptical orbits 
and other examples of induction 

 when mr mill goes on to compare wliat he 
calls different predictions — the first the tiue explana 
tion of eclipses by the shadows which the planets and 
satellites cast upon one another and the other the 
belief that they will occur whenever some great cala 
mity is impending over mankind i must i’cply fia i 
have stated already art that to class such super 
stitions as the last with cases of induction appears to 
me u confound all use of words and to prevent as 
far as it goes all profitable exercise of thought what 
possible advantage can result from comparing as if 
they were alike the relation of two descriptions of a 
phenomenon each to a certain extent true and there 
fore both consistent with the relation of a scientific 
truth to a false and baseless superstition i 

 but may make another remark on this 
esuiple so strangely introduced if under the in 
fluence of fear and superstition men may make such 
mistakes with regard to laws of nature as to imagine 
that eclipses portend calamities are they quite secure 
from mistakes in description do not theveiy per 



hr hill’s logic 


 


sons who tell ns how eclipses predict disasters also 
describe to us fiery swords seen in the air and armies 
fighting in the sky so that even in this extreme case 
at the very limit of the rational exercise of human 
powers there is nothing to distinguish description 
from induction 

i shall now leave the reader to judge whether this 
feature in the history of science — that several views 
which appear at fiist quite dilferent are yet all true — 
which mr jmill calls a curious and interesting remark 
of mine and which he allows to be “ strikingly true” 
of the inductions which he calls description i 
is as he says “unequivocally false” of other induc 
tions and i shall confide in having general assent 
with me wjion i continue to speak of kepler’s induc 
tion of the elliptical orbits 

r now proceed to another remark 

iii in discovery a new conception is introduced — 
 there is a difference betwew mr isiill and me 
ill our view of the essential elements of this induction 
of kepler which affects all other cases of inductioji 
and which is i think the most extensive and im 
portant of the differences between us i must there 
fore venture to ilwell upon it a little in detail 

i conceive that kepler in discovering the law of 
mars’s motion and in asserting that the planet moved 
in an ellipse did this — he bound together particular 
observations of separate jdaces of mars by the notion 
or as have called it the conception of an ellipse 
which was mipplied by his own mind other persons 
and ho too before he made this discovery had present 
to their minds the fiicts of such separate successive posi 
tions of the planet but could not bind them together 
rightly because they did not apply to them tins con 
ception of an ellipse to supply this conception re 
quinil a special preparation and a special activity in 
the mind of the discoverer he and others before 
him tried other ways of connecting the special facts 
none of which fully succeeded to discover such a 
connexion the mind must bo conversant with certain 
relations of sace and with certain kinds of figures 



 


philosophy op discovery 


to discover the right figure was a matter requiring 
research invention resource to hit upon the right 
conception is a difficult step and when this step is 
once made the facts assume a different aspect from 
what they liad before that done they are seen in a 
new point of view and the eatcliing this point of 
view is a sjxicial mental operation requiring special 
endowments and habits of thought before this the 
facts arc seen as detached separate lawless after 
wards they are seen as connected simple regular as 
paiiis of one general fact and thereby possessing innu 
inenible new relations lcforc unseen keiler then 
i say bound together the facts by superinducing upon 
them the conceptwn of an and this was an 

essential element in his induction 

 and there is the same essential element in 
all inductive discoveries in all cases facts before 
detached and lawless are bound together by a new 
thought they are reduced to law by being seen in 
a new point of view to catch this new point of 
view is an act of the mind springing from its pre 
vious preparation and habits the facts in other 
discovtiiies are brought together according to other 
relations or as j have called them ideas — the 
ideas of time of force of number of hesemblance 
of elementary composition of polarity and tlie like 
but in all cases the mind performs the operation by 
an apprehension of some such relations by singling 
out the one true relation by combining the apprehen 
sion of the true relation with the facts bywapplying to 
them the conception of such a relation 

 in previous writings i have not only stated 
this view generally hut i liave followed it into de 
tail exemplifying it in the greater jart of the history 
of the princijial inductive sciences in succession 
have pointed out what are the conceptions which have 
been introduced in eveiy prominent discoveiy in those 
sciences and have noted to which of the above ideas 
or of the like ideas each belongs the peiformance 
of this task is the office of the greater part of my 
phuosophy of the inductive sciences for that work 



 


mb mill’s logic 

is in reality no less historical than the history which 
preceded it the history of ihs iriiductivo sciences is 
the history of the discoveries mainly so far as con 
cerns the facts which wore brought together to form 
sciences the fhuosopfty is in the first ten books 
the history of the idms and conceptions by means of 
which the facts were connected so as to give nse 
scientific truths it would be easy for me to give a 
long list of the ideas and oonceimons thus brought 
into view but i may rcifer any reader who wislies to 
see such a list to the iables of cvn tents of the history 
tnd of the first ton books of the ph ilosophy 

 that these ideas and conceptions are really 
ilistinct elements of the scituitific truths thus obtained 

i conceive to bo proved beyond doubt not only by 
considering that the discoveries luner averc made nor 
could be made till the right conception was obtained 
and by seeing how difficult it often was to obtain this 
element but also by seeing thal the idea and the 
conception itself as distinct jvoin tlie facts was in 
almost every science the subject of long and obstinate 
controvcisios — coiitroveisies which tuined upon the 
jssible relations of ideas much more than upon the 
actual relations of facts the first ten books of the 
fhilosopty to which i have refen ed contain the his 
tory of a great number of these controversies tluse 
controversies make up a large portion of the history 
if each science a portion uite as important as the 
study of the facts and a portion at every stage of 
the science quite as essential to the progicss of truth 
men ill seeking and obtjuuing scientific kncpwledge 
have always shown that they found the formation of 
right conceptions in their own minds to be an essen 
tial part of the process 

 moreover the presence of a conception ot the 
mind as a special element of the inductive process 
and as the tie by which the particular facts are bound 
together is further indicated by there being some 
special new term or phrase introduced in every in 
duction or at least some ttuin or piirase thence 
forth steadily applied to the facts which had not been 



 philosophy op discovery 

applied to them before as when kepler asserted that 
mars moved roxind the sun in an elliptical orbuj or 
when newton asserted that the planets gravitate to 
wards the sun these new terms elliptical orhit and 
gravitate miuk the new conceptions on which the 
inductions depend i have in the philosophy further 
illustrated this application of ‘‘technical terms’ that 
is fixed and settled terms in every inductive disco 
very and have spoken of their use in enabling men 
to proceed from each such discovery to other disco 
veries more geneml but notice these tenns here 
for the purpose of sliowing the existence of a concept 
tion in the discoverer’s mind coitcsponding to the 
term thus introduced which conception tlie term is 
intended to convey to the minds of those to whom the 
discovery is communicated 

 but this element of discovery — right concep 
tions suijplied by the mind in order to bind the facts 
together — mr millmenies to be an element at all he 
says of kepler’s discovery of the elliitical orbit i 
 “it supei’added nothing to the particular facts 
which it served to bind together” yet he adds “ex 
cept indeed tie knowledge that a resemblaiice existed 
between the planetary orbit and other ellipses” that 
is except the knowledge that it was an ellipse — 
precisely the circumstance in wliicli the discovery con 
sisted kepler he says “ asserted as a fact that the 
planet moved in an ellipse but this fact which 
kepler did not add to but found in tlie motion of 
the planet was the very fact the separate parts of 
which had been separately observed it was the sum 
of the different oljservations” 

 that the fact of the elliptical motion was not 
merely the sum of the different observations is plain 
from this that other ersons and kepler himself be 
fore his discovery did not find it by adding together 
the observations the fact of the elliptical orbit was 
not the sum of the observations merely it was the 


 b l c ill 




mr mills logic 


 

sum of tlie observations seen under a nevj pohit of 
view which point of view kepler’s mind supplied 
kepler found it in the facts because it wiui there no 
doubt for one reason but also forianother because 
he had in his mind those relations of thought which 
enabled him to find it we may illustrate tlis by a 
familiar analogy we too fiud the law in kepler’s 
book but if we did not undeistand latin we should 
not find it there wc must icjarn laiti in order to 
find the law in the book in like maimer a disco 
verer must know the language of science as well as 
ipok at the book of nature in order to find scientic 
truth all the discussions and controversies respect 
ing ideas and conceptions of which i have spoken 
may be looked upon as discussions and controveisies 
respecting the grammar of the language in which na 
ture speaks to the scientific mind man is the inter 
preler of nature not the spectator merely but the 
interpreter the study of the language as well as 
the mere sight of the characters is requisite in order 
that we may road the iuscjitious which are written 
on the face of the world and this study of the lan 
guage of nature that is of the necessary coherencies 
and derivations of the i’elations of phenomena is to be 
pursued by examining ideas as well as mere pheno 
mena — by tracing the formation of conceptions as 
well as the occuinulation of facts and this is what 
i have tried to do in the books alrcatly referred to 

 mr mill has not noticed in any considerable 
degree what i have said of the formation of the con 
ceptions which enter into the various sciences but he 
has ii general terms denied that the conception ia 
anything difterent from the fiicts themselves “ if’ 
he says i “the facts are rightly classed under 
the conceptions it is because there is in the facta 
themselves something of which the conception is a 
copy” but it is a copy which cannot be made by a 
person without peculiar endowments just as a per 
son cannot copy an illwritten inscription so as to 
make it convey sense unless he understand the lan 
guage “ conceptions” mr mill says ii “ do not 

s 



 philosophy op discovery 

develope themselves from within but are impressed 
from without” but what comes from without is not 
enough they must have both origins or they cannot 
make knowledge tho conception” he says again 
ii “is not furnished hy the mind till it has 
been furnished to tho mind” but it is furnished to 
the mind by its own activity opeiating according to 
its own laws no doubt the conception may bo 
formed and in cases of discovery must bo formed by 
the suggestion and excitement which the facts them 
selves produce and must be so moulded as to agree 
with the facts but this docs not make it superfluous 
to examine out of what materials such conccptioris are 
forml and how they are capable of being moulded so 
as to exress laws of nature especially when we see 
how large a share this pait of discovery — the examina 
tion how our ideas can bo nxodilied so as to agree with 
nature — holds in the liistory of science 

 i have alaady art given as evidence 
that tho conception outers as an element in every in 
duction the constant introduction in such cases of a 
new fixed term or jhriise mr mill ii notices 
this introduction of a new phrase in such cases as 
impoiiiant thougli he docs not appear willing to allow 
that it is necessary yet the necessity of the concep 
tion at least appeais to result fretm the considerations 
wliich he puts forward “what darkness” he says 
“ would have been spread over geometrical demonstra 
tion if wherever the word circle is used the definition 
of a circle was insci’ted instead of it” “ if we want 
to make a jiarticular combination of ideas permanent 
in the mind tliere is nothing which clenches it like a 
name specially devoted to express it” in iny view 
the new conception is the nail which connects the 
previous notions and tho name as mr mill says 
clenches the junction 

 i have above art referred to the diffi 
culty of getting hold of the right conception as a 
proof that induction is not a mere juxtaposition of 
facts mr mill does not dispute that it is often diffi 
cult to liit upon tho right conception he says i 



mr mill s logic 


 

that a conception of the mind is introduced is in 
deed most certain and mrwliewell has rightly stated 
elsewhere that to liit upon the right conception is 
often a far more difficult and more meritorious achieve 
ment than to prove its applicability when obtained 
but” he adds “a conception implies and corresponds 
to something conceived and although the conception 
itself is not in tlio facts but in our mind it must be a 
conception of something which roa i in tjie facts” 
but to this reply that its being really in the facts 
does not help us at all towards knowledge if we can 
not see it there as the joct says 

it the mind that sees the outward eyes 

jresent the object but the mind descries 

and this is true of the sight which produces know 
ledge as well as of the sight avhich priduces pleasure 
aiifl pain wliicli is refoired to iu the tale 

 mr mill puts his view as pposel to mine iu 
various ways but as will easily be understood the 
answers which i have to offer arc in all cases nearly 
to the same effect thus lie says ii ‘hhe tardy 
developnicnt of sevond of the physical sciences for 
example of optics electricity magictism and the 
higher generalizations of chemistry imr whcwell 
ascribes to the fact that mankind had not yet pos 
sessed themselves of the idea of polarity that is of 
opposite properties in oposite dirctions but what 
was there to suggest such an idea until by a sepai’ate 
examination of several if these different branches of 
knowledge it was shown that the facts of each f them 
did jiresent iu some instances at hast the curious 
phenomena of opposite propcidics in opposite direc 
tions” but on this t observe that these facts did 
not nor do yet pimsont this conception to ordinary 
minds tho opposition of properties and even tho 
opposition of directions which arc thus apprehended 
by jirofound cultivators of science are of an abstruse 
and recondite kind and to conceive any one kind of 
polarity in its proper generality is a process which 
few persons hitlierio appear to have mastered still 
less have men in gencr come to conceive of them all 



 o 


philosophy of discovery 


as modifications of a geneial notion of polarity tlie 
description which i have given of polarity in general 

 opposite properties in opjosite directions” is of itself 
a very imperfect account of the manner in which cor 
responding antitheses are involved in the portions of 
science into which polar relations cnter in excuse 
of its imperfection i may say that i believe it is the 
first attempt to define polarity in general but yet 
the conception of polarity lias certainly been strongly 
and effectively present in the minds of many of tho 
sagacious men who have discovered and unravelled 
polar phenomena they attempted to convey this 
conception each in his own subject sometimes by 
various and peculiar expressions sometimes liy imagi 
nary mecliaiiisin by which the antithetical results were 
produced them mode of expressing themselves being 
often defective or imperfect often containing what 
was siipeifluous and their meaniiig was commonly 
very imperfectly apprehended by most of their hearers 
and readers but still the conception was there gra 
dually working itself into clearness and distinctness 
and in the mean time directing their experiments and 
forming an essential element of their discoveries so 
far would it be from a sufficient statement of tlie case 
to say that they conceived polarity because they saw 
it — that they saw it as soon as if came into view — 
and that they described it as they saw it 

 the way in which such conceptions acquire 
clearness and distinctness is often by means of discus 
sions of definitions to define well a thought wliioh 
alreswly enters into trains of discovery is often a diffi 
cult matter the businciss of such definition is a port 
of the business of discovery tliese and other re 
marks connected with these which i had made in the 
fhiloaophjy mr mill has quoted and adopted il 
they appear to me to point very distinctly to the doc 
trine to which he refuses his assent — that there is a 
special process in the mind in addition to the mere 
observation of facts which is necessary at every stop 
in the progress of knowledge the conception must 
be formed before it can be dejmed the definition 



mr mill’s logic 


 


gives the jast stamp of distinctness to the conception 
and enahles ns to express in a compact and lucid 
form the new scicntihc propositions into which the 
new conception enters 

 since mr mill assents to so much of what has 
been said inthe fhhosophy with regard to the process 
of scientific discovery how it may be asked would he 
express these doctrines so as to exclude that which he 
thinks erroneous if lie objects to our saying that 
wjien we obtain a new inductive truth we connect 
phenomena by applying to them a new conception 
which fits them in what terms wonhl he describe the 
process jf he will not agree to say that in order to 
discover the law of the facts we must find an apro 
priate conception what language w uld he use instead 
of this tills is a natural question and the answer 
cannot fail to throw light on tlie relation in which his 
views and mine stand to eich other 

mr mill would say i believe tliat when we obtain 
a new inductive law of facts we find something in 
which the facts resemble each other and that the busi 
ness of making such discoveries is tlie business of dis 
covering such resemblances thus he says of me 
ii his colligation of facts by means of appro 
priate conceptions js but the ordinary iioccss of find 
ing by a comparison of phenomena in what consists 
their agreement or resemblance” and the metliods 
of experimental inquiry winch he gives i c 
proceed upon the supjiosition that the business of dis 
covery may bo tlins more properly described 

 there is no doubt that when we discover a law 
of nature by induction we find some point in which 
all the particular facts agree all the orbits of tlio 
planets agree in being ellipses as kepler discovered 
all falling lodies agiee in being acted on by a uniform 
force as galileo discovered all refracted rays agree in 
having the sines of incidence and refraction in a con 
stant ratio as snell discovered all the bodies in the 
universe agree in attracting each other as newton 
discovered all chemical compounds agree in being 
constituted of elements in definite proportions as

dalton discovered but it appears to me a most scanty 
vague and incomplete account of tliese steps in sci 
ence to say tliat the authors of them discovered some 
thing in which the facts in each case agreed the 
point in wliich the cases agree is of the most diverse 
kind in the different cases — in some a relation of 
space in othci‘s the action of a force in others the 
mode of composition of a substance — and tlie point 
of agreement visible to the discoverer alone does not 
come even into his siglit till after the facts have been 
connected by thoughts of his own and regarded in 
points of view in which he by his mental acts places 
them it would seem to me not much more inappro 
priate to say that an officer who disciplbics his men 
till they move together at the wfrd of command does 
so by finding something in which they agree if the 
power of consentaneous motion did not exist in the in 
dividuals he could not create it but that power being 
there he finds it and uses it of course i am aware 
tliat the parallel of the two cases is not exact but in 
the one case as in the other that in which the pai 
ticular things are found to agree is something formed 
in the mind of iiini who brings tiic agreement into 
view

in the observed facts combinations of antecedents 
abg bgy a e src and combinations of corre 
sponding consequents ahe be ade c and let the 
object of inquiry be the consequence of some cause a 
or the cause of some consequence a the method of

mcnit sucli facts as abe the consequent of a bg and 
ade the consequent of ade then a i the consequent 
of a the method of dilference teaches us that 
wlien we find such facts as ahe the consequent of abc

is h then we may infer that the efiect of g is c the 
method of concomitant vanations teaches us tliat if 
a phenomenon a varies according as another phenome 
non a varies there is some connexion of causation 
direct or indirect between a and a

are we to reduce them to this form you say wjten 
we find the combination of abg with ahe and abd

even now that the discoveries are made who will

example the method of agreement to the iifistantib 
ostemivw the method of differences to the in stunt ice 
absentiw in froxinio and the instanjtlm cnicis the 
method of concomitant variations to the intaniim 
migrantes and with regard to the value of such 
methods i believe all study of science will convince 
us more and more of the wisdom of the remarks which 
sir john herschel has made upon tliem 

“it has always appeared to us we must confess 
that the help which the classification of instances 
under their different titles of prerogative affords to 
inductions hovever just such classification may be in 
itself is yet more apparent than real tlie force of 
the insbmee must be felt in the mind before it can be 
referred to its place in the system and before it can 
be either referred or appreciated it must bo known 
and when it is appreciated wo are ready enough to 
weave our web of induction without greatly troubling 
ourselves whence it derives the weight we acknow 
ledge it to have in our decisions no doubt such in 
stances as these are highly instructive but the diffi 
culty in physics is to find such not to perceive their 
force when found” 

v his examples — if mr mill’s four methods 
had been applied by him in his book to a large body 
of conspicuous and undoubted examples of disoovety 
well selected and well analysed extending along the 
whole history of science we shguld have been better

mb mill’s logic 


 

able to estimate the yalue of these methods mr mill 
has certainly offered a number of examples of liis 
methods but i hope i may say without offence that 
they appear to me to be wanting in the conditions 
wliich i have mentioned as i have to justify myself 
for rejecting mr milfs criticism of doctrines which i 
have put foiward and examples wliich i have adduced 
i may i tnist be allowed to offer some critical re 
marks in return bearing upon the exnmples which he 
has given in order to illustrate his doctrines and 
precepts 

 the fiist remark which i have to make is 
that a large proportion of liis examples i kc 
is taken from one favourite author wlio however 
great his merit may be is too recent a writer to have 
had his discoveries confirmed by the corresponding 
investigations and siarching criticisms of other la 
bourers in the same field and placed in their proper 
and permanent relation to established truths these 
alleged discoveries being at the same time principally 
such as deal wdth the most complex and slippery por 
tions of science the laws of vital action thus mr 
mill has adduced as examples of discoveries prof 
liebig’s doctrine — that death is produced by certain 
metallic poisons through their forming indecomposable 
compounds that the effect of respiration upon the 
blood consists in the conversion of peroxide of iron 
into protoxide — that the antiseptic power of salt arises 
from its attraction for moisture — that chemical action 
is contagious and otlicrs now supposing aliat wc 
have no doubt of the tmth of these discoveries we 
must still obsene that they cannot wisely be cited 
in order to exemplify the nature of the progress 
of knowledge till they have been verified by other 
chemists and worked into their places in the general 
scheme of chemistry especially since it is tolerably 
certain that in process of verification they will 
be modified and mpre precisely defined nor can i 
think it judicious to take so large a proportion of our 
examples from a region of science in which of all 
ports of our material knowledge the conceptions both of 



 philosophy op discovert 

ordinary peraons and even of men of science themselves 
are most loose and obscure and the genuine pnnciples 
most contested which is the case in physiology it 
would be easy i think to point out tlio vague and 
indeterminate character of many of the expressions in 
which the above examples are projounded as well as 
their doubtful position in the scale of chemical gene 
ralization but i have said enough to show why i 
cannot give much wcight to these as cardinal exam 
ples of the method of discovery and therefore i shall 
not examine in detail how far they support mr iviiirs 
methods of inquiry 

 mr liebig supplies the first and the majority 
of mr mill’s examples in chapter ix of liis book on 
induction the second is an example for which mr 
mill states himself to be indebted to mr alexander 
bainj the law established being this that i 
electricity cannot exist in one body without the simul 
taneous excitement of th opposite electricity in some 
neighbouring body which mr mill also coufinns by 
reference to mr faraday’s experiments on voltaic 
wires 

i confess i am quite at a loss to understand what 
there is in the doctrine here ascribed to mr bain 
which was not known to the electricians who from 
the tisne of franklin explained the phenomena of the 
leyden vial i may observe also that the mention of 
an ‘‘electrified atmosphere” implies a hypothesis long 
obsolete the essential point in all those explanations 
was that each electricity produced by induction the 
opposite electricity in neighbouring bodies as i have 
tried to make apparent in the llwtory faraday has 
more recently illustrated this universal coexistence of 
opposite electricities with his usual felicity 

but the conjunction of this fact with voltaic pheno 
mena implies a nonrecognition of some of the simplest 
doctrines of the subject “ since” it is said i 
“ common or machine electricity md voltaic electricity 


 b xi c xl 



mr mill’s logic 


 

may bo considered for the present purpose to be iden 
tical faraday wished to know c’ i think mr 
faraday would be much astonished to learn that he 
considered electricity in equilibrium and electricity in 
the form of a voltaic current to be for any purpose 
identical nor do conceive that he would assent to 
the expression in the next page that “ from the nature 
of a voltaic charge the two opposite currents necessary 
to the existence of each ither are both accommodated 
in one wire” mr faraday has as it appears to me 
studiously avoided assenting ti this hypothesis • 

 tlic next example is the one already so co 
piously dwelt upon by sir jolm tteischel dr wells’s 
researches on the production of dew i have already 
said” that “this investigation although it has some 
times been praised as an original discovery was in fact 
only resolving the jhenomeiioii into principles already 
discovered” namely the doctrine of a constihieitt tern 
perature of vapour the different conducting power of 
different bodies and the like and this agrees in 
substance with what mr mill says i that the 
discovery when made was corroborated by deduction 
from the known laws of aqueous vapour of conduc 
tion and the like dr wells’s researches on dew 
tended much in this country to draw attention to the 
general principles of atmology and we may see in 
this and in other cxainjdes whiclx mr inlill adduces 
that the explanation of sjecial phenomena by means 
of generafprinciples already establislied has for com 
mon minds a greater charm and is more complacently 
dwelt on than the discovery of tho general principles 
themselves 

 the next example i is given in order to 
illustrate tho method of llesidues and is the discoveiy 
by m arago that a disk of copper affects the vibra 
tions of tho magnetic needle but this apparently de 
tached fact affords little instruction compared with the 
singularly sagacious researches by which mr faraday 


u pmfbxiilclxart 


 


philosophy of discovery 


discovered the cause of this effect to reside in the 
voltaic ciirrents which the motion of the magnetic 
needle developed in the copper i have spoken of this 
discovery in the mr mill however is 

quoting sir john herschel in thus illustrating the 
method of besidiics he rigltly gives the pertur 
bations of the planets and satellites as better exam 
ples of the method 

 in the next chapter c x mr mill speaks of 
plurality of causes and of the intermixture of effects 
and gives examples of such cases he here teaches 
i that chemical synthesis and analysis afi when 
oxygen and hydrogen comksc water and when water 
is resolved into oxygon and hydrogen is properly 
traufifovmatiou but that because we find that the 
weight of the compound is equal to the sum of the 
weights of the elements we take up the notion of 
chemical composituyu i have endeavoured to show 
that the maxim that the sum of the weights of the 
elements is equal to the weight of the compound was 
historically not proved from experiment but assumed 
in the reasonings ujxii experiments 

 i hare now made my remarks upon nearly all 
the examples which mr jvlill gives of scientific in 
quiry so far as they consist of knowledge which has 
really been obtained i may mention as points which 
appear to me to inteifcre with the value of mr mill’s 
references to examples expressions which i cannot 
reconcile with just conceptions of scientific truth j as 
when he says i “some other force which im 
pinges on the first force” and very frequently indeed 
of tlie “ tangential foresy as coordinate with the cen 
trijictal force 

when ho speaks ii note of “ the doctrine now 
universally received that the earth is a great natural 
magnet with two poles” he does not recognize the 
recent theory of gauss so remarkably coincident with 

m b xtll c viil 

u given also in the hia sc b xul vil sect 
u imdi h vl c iv 


mr mills logic 


 

a vast body of facts® indeed in his statement he 
rejects no less the earlier views proposed by halley 
theorized by euler and confirmed by hansteen which 
show that we aie compelled to assume at least four 
poles of terrestrial magnetism which i had given an 
account of in the first edition of the history 

there are several other cases which he puts in 
which the knowledge pcken of not having been yet 
acquired he tells us how he would set about aaiuiring 
it for instance if the question were i whether 
mercuiy be a cure for a given disease or whether the 
brain be a voltaic pile ii or whether the moon 
be inliabited ii or whether all crows are black 
ii i confess that have no expectatinn of any 
advantage to philosojihy from discussions of this kind 

 i will add also that i do not think any light 
can be thrown upon scientific methols at present by 
grouping along with such physical inquiries as i have 
been speaking of sjecuhitions concerning the human 
mind its qualities and operations thus lie speaks 
i of human characters as exemplifying the 
effect of plurality of causes of i the phenomena 
of our mental nature vhich are analogous to chemical 
rather than to dynamical phenomena of i the 
reason why susceptible persons are imaginative to 
which i’ may add the passage where he says i 
“ let us take as an example of a phenomenon which 
we have po means of fabricating artificially a human 
mind” jjiieso and othfer like examples occur in the 
part of his work in which he is speaking of scientific 
inquiry in general not in the book on the logic of 
the moral sciences and are i think examples more 
likely to lead us astitiy than to help our progress in 
discovering the laws of scientific inquiry in the or 
dinary sense of the term

the views respecting the conditions of scientific in 
duction to which have been led by such a survey as 
i could make of the whole history of the principal 
inductive sciences and especially to those views to 
which mr mill offers his objections® 

mr mill thinks that have been too favourable to 
the otnidoymeiit of hyotheses as means of discovering 
scientific truth and that i have countenanced a lax 
ness of method in allowing hypotheses to be esta 
blished merely in virtue of the accordance of their 
results with the phenomena i leliev i should be 
as cautious as mr jmill in accepting mere hypotheti 
cal explanations of phenomena in any case in which 
we had the jihenoniena and their relations laced 
before both of us ‘in an equally clear light i have 
not accepted the undulatoiy theory of itcat though 
recommended by so many coincidences and analogies 
but i see some grave reasons for not giving any great 
weight to mr ivlill’s admonitions — nasems dniwn 


there arc some points in my doc

catory sciences to which mr mill 
objects lii c but there la

to remark here except one point 
after bpeaking of classiflcation of

no doubt that it is supported by the

from the language which he uses on the subject and 
whiph appears to me inconsistent with the conditions 
of the cases to wliich he applies it thus when he 
says ii that the condition of a hypothesis account 
ing for all the knoyn phenomena is “often fulfilled 
ecpially well by two conlllcting hypotheses” i can 
imly say that i know of no such case in the history of 
science whence tlie phenomena are at all numerous 
and complicated and that if such a were to oc 
cur one of the hyotheses might always be nsoved 
into the other when he says tliat “this evidence 
tlio agreement of the results of the hypothesis wdth 
the phenomena cannot be of the smallest value be 
cause we cannot have in the case of such an hypothe 
sis the assurance that if the hypotliesis be false it 
must lead to results at variance with the true facts” 
wc must t’cply with due suhmission that we have in 
the case spoken of the most complete evidence of this 
for any change in the hypothesis would make it inca 
pable of accounting for the facts when he says that 
“if wc give ouiselvcs the license of inventing the 
causes as well as tludr laws a person of fertile imagi 
nation might devise a hundred modes of accounting 
for any given fact” i reply that the question is about 
accounting for a lare and complex series of facts of 
which the laws have been aseeitairied and as a test 
of mr mill’s assertion i would propose as a challenge 
to any person of feitile imagiiiatin to devise any one 
other hyiithcsis to account for the pertnibationa of 
the moon or the coloured fringes of shadows bcsiles 
the hypothesis by which they have actually been ex 
plained with such curious completeness this challenge 
has been repeatedly offered but never in any degree 
accepted and i eiitertain no apprehension that mr 
mill’s supposition will ever be verified by such a per 
formaucok 

 i see additional reason for mistrusting the 
precision of mr mills views of that accordance of 
phenomena with the results of a hypothesis in several 
others of the expressions which he uses ii he 
qeaks of a hypothesis being a ptamible explanation 



 


philosophy op discovert 


of all or most of the phenomena” but the case which 
we have to consider is where it gives an eocaet repre 
sentation of all the phenomena in which its results 
can be traced he speaks of its being certain that 
the laws of the phenomena are some measure 
attajogous to those given by the hrpothesis the case 
to be dealt with being that they are in every way 
identical he speaks of this anogy being certain 
from the fact that the hypothesis can be “ for a moment 
tenable as if any one had recommended a hypothesis 
which is tenable only while a small part of the fiicts 
are considered when it is inconsistent with others 
which a fuller examination of the case discloses i 
have nothing to siiy and have said nothing in favour 
of hypotheses which are fwt tenable he says there 
aie many such harmonies running through the laws 
of ihenomena in other respects radically distinct” 
and ho gives as an instance the laws of light and 
heat i have never alleged such hannoiiies as giounds 
of theory unless they ohould amount to identities 
and if they should do this i have no doubt that the 
most sober tliinkeis will suppose the causes to be of 
the same kind in the two harmonizing instances if 
chlorine iodine and bromc or sulphur and phosphoru 
have as mr hfill says analogous properties i should 
call these substances analogfrasr but i can see no 
temptation to frame an hyothesis that they ai’c iden 
tical which he seems to so long as chemistry 

proves them distinct but any hypothesis ofn analogy 
iji the constitution of these elements suppose for in 
stance a resemblance in tlieir atomic foim or compo 
sition wuld seem to me to have a fair claitn trial 
and to be capable of being elevated rom dhe dgree 
of probability to another by the number variety and 
exactitude of the explanations of phenomena which it 
should furnish 

vll against prediction of facts — these ex 
pressions of mr mill have reference to a way in which 
hypotheses may be corroborated in estimating the 
value of which it appears that he and i differ it 
seems to be thought” he says ii “ that an hypo

thesis of the sort in question is entitled to a more 
favourable reception if besides accounting for tlie 
fects pviously known it has led to the anticipation 
and prediction of others which experience afterwards 
veritied” and ho adds “ such predictions and their 
fulfil ment are indeed well caloulatd to strike the 
ignorant vulgar” but it is strange he says that any 
considerable stress should be laid upon such a coinci 
dence by scientific thinkers however strange it may 
seem to him there is no doubt that the most scientific 
thinkers far more than the ignorant vulgar have 
allowed the coincidence of results predicted by theory 
with fact afterwards obsened to produce ilie strongest 
effects upon their conviction and that all the best 
established theories have obtained their permanent 
place in general acceptance in virtue of such coinci 
dences moie than of any other evidence it was not 
the ignorant vulgar alone who were struck by the 
return of halley’s comet as an evidence of the new 
tonian theory nor was it the ignorant vulgal’ who 
were struck witli those facts which did so much strike 
men of science jis curiously felicitous proofs of the 
undulatory theoiy of light — tlie production of daik 
iieas by two luminous rays inteifering in a special 
manner the refraction of a single ray of light into 
a conical pencil andother complex yet precise results 
predicted by the theory and vei’ified by experiment 
it must one would think strike all persons in propor 
tion to their thoughtfulness that when nature thus 
does our bidding she acknowledges that we have 
learnt lier tine language tf we can predict new facts 
which we liave not seen as well as explain those which 
we have seen it must be because our explanation is 
not a mere formula of obseiwed facts but a truth of 
a deeper kind mr mill says ‘‘if the laws of the 
propagation of light agiee with those of the vibrations 
of an elastic fluid in so many respects as is necessary 
to make the hypothesis a plausiblo explanatipn of all 
or most of the phenomena known vat the time it is 
nothing strange that they sliould accord with each 
other in one respect more’ nothing strange if the

theory be true but quite unaccountable if it be not 
if copy a long series of letters of which the last 
halfdozen are concealed and if i guess those aright 
as is found to be the case when they are afterwards 
uncovered this must be because i have made out the 
import of the inscription to say that becaiise i have 
copied all that i could see it is nothing strange that 
i should guess those which cannot see would bo 
absurd without suppohiiig such a ground for guessing 
the notion that the discovery of the laws and causes 
of phenomena is a loose haphuzard sort of guessing 
which gives “plausible” explanations accidental co 
incidences casual “ harmonies” laws “in some mea 
sure analogous ” to the true ones suppositions “tenable” 
for a time appears to me to be a misaprehcnsion of 
the whole nature of science as it certainly is inappli 
cable to the case to which it is principally applied by 
mr mill 

 there is another kind of evidence of theories 
very closely approaching to the verification of untried 
predictions and to which apparently mr mill docs 
not attach much importance since he has borrowed 
the tenn by which i have described it consilience 
but has applied it in a dififerent manner ii 
ri c i have pokcn in the phuosophty of 
the cmsilience of inductions as one of the tests of 
hypoihesesy and have exemplified it by many instances 
for example the theory of uni versa gravitation ob 
tained by induction froju the motions of the planets 
was found to explain also that peculiar motion of 
the spheroidal earth which produces the precession 
of the equinoxes this have said was a striking 
and surprising coincidence which gave the theory a 
stamp of truth beyond the power of ingenuity to 
counterfeitw i may compare such occurrences to a 
case of interpreting an unknown character in which 
two different inscriptions deciphered by different 
persons had given the same alihabot we should

in such a case believe with great confidence the 
alphabet was the true one and i will add that i 
believe the history of science ofiers no example in 
which a theory supported by such consiliences had 
been afterwards proved to be false 

 mr mill accepts ii a rule of m comte’s 
that we may apjdy hypotheses provided they are capa 
ble of being afterwaids vcrifietl as facts i have a 
much higher respect for mr mill’s opinion than for 
m comte’s® but i do not think that this rule will be 
found of any value it aippears to me to be tainted 
with the vice which i liavo already noted of throwing 
the whole burthen of explanation upon the unex

and definite opjiosition to theory as i have said 
the newtonian theory ia a fact every true theory 
is a fact nor does the distinction become more clear 
by mr mill’s examines “the vortices of descartes 
would have been” he says “a perfectly legitimate 
hypothesis if it had been possible by any mode of

possessing to bring the question whether such vortices

causes these points being agreed uon think thai 
a little further consideration will lead to the conviction 
tliat newton’s rule of philosophizing will best become 
a valuable guide if we understand it as assorting that

of phenomena as the revolutions of the planets ihe 
fall of a stone and the precession of the equinoxes 
lead us to tlie same cause such a coincidence gives a 



mr mill’s logic 


 

reality to the cause we have in fact in such a case 
a consilience of inductions 

 when mr mill condemns mo ii using 
however exprebsions of civility which i ghidly ac 
knowledge foi’ having recognized no mode of induc 
tion except that of trying hypothesis after h’dotheis 
until one is found which fits the phenomena i must 
beg to remind the readers of our works that mr mdl 
himself allows i that the process uf finding a 
conception which binds together observed facts ‘s 
tentative that it consists of a succession of guesses 
many being rejected until one at last occurs fit to be 
chosen” i must remind them also that i have given 
a section upon tlie est of llyjxuiese to whicli i 
have just referred — that i have given various methods 
of induction as the afethod of gradation the method 
of natural classification the method of curves the 
aiethod of means the method of least squares the 
method of mesiduea all which i have illustrated by 
consyicuous examples from the history of science 
besides which i conceive that wliat i have said of the 
ideas belonging to each science and of the construc 
tion and explication of conceptions will point out in 
each case in what region we are to look for the in 
ductive element ii order to make new discoveries 
i have already ventured to say elsewhere that the 
metods which i have given are as definite and prac 
tical as any others which have been proposed with the 
great additional advantage of being the methods by 
which all great discoveries in science have really been 
made 

ix successwe generalizations — there is one 
feature in the construction of science which mr mill 
notices but to which he does not ascribe as i conceive 
its due importance mean that process by which we 
not only ascend from particular facts to a genend law 
but when this is done ascend from the first general 
law to others more general and so on proceeding to 
the highest point of generalization this character of 
tile scientific process aves first clearly pointed out by 
bacon and is one of the most noticeable instances of 



 puilosophy of disoovebt 

his philosophical sagacity ‘‘there are” he says “two 
ways and can be only two of seeking and finding 
truth the one from sense and particulars takes a 
flight to the most general axioms and from these 
principles and their truth settled once for all invents 
and judges of intermediate axioms the other method 
collects axioms from sense and particulars ascending 
coruinuoualy and by degrees so tliat in the end it 
aitives at the most general axioms” meaning by 
axiovls laws or princijdes the structure of the 
most complete sciences consists of neveral such steps 
—floors as bacon calls them of successive generaliza 
tion and thus this structure may be exhibited as 
a kind of scientific pjramid have constructed this 
pyiamid in the case of the science of astronomy 
and i am gratified to find that the illustrious hum 
boldt approves of the design and eaks of it as 
executed with complete success the capability of 
being exhibited in this form of successive genemli 
zatious arising fi’oin particulars upward to some very 
general law is the condition of all tolei’ably peitect 
sciences and the steps of the successive generalizations 
are commonly the most important events in the history 
of the science 

 mill does ot reject this process of ge 
neralization but he gives it no conspicuous place 
making it only one of three modes of reducing a law 
of causation into other laws “there is” he says 
i “the avlsvmption of one law under another 
the gathering up of several laws into one more general 
law wliich includes them all ho adds afterwards 
that the general law is the smn of the partial ones 
i an expression which appears to me inadequate 
for reasons which i have already stated the general 
law is not the mere sum of the particular laws it is

mr mill’s logic 


 

vi v a new conception is introduced thus newton 
did not merely add together the laws of the motions 
of the moon and of the planets and of the satellites 
and of the earth ho looked at them altogether as the 
result of a universal force of mutual gravitation and 
therein consisted his generalization and the like 
might be pointed out in other cases 

 i am the more led to apeak of mr mill as not 
having given due importance to this process of suc 
cejjsive generalization by the way in which he speaks 
in another place ii of this doctrine of bacon 
he conceives bacon “to have been radically wrong 
when he enunciates as a universal mle that induction 
should proceed from the lowest to the middle prin 
ciples and from those to the highest never reversing 
that order and consequently leaving no room for the 
discovery of new principles by way of deduction at 

 i conceive that the inductive table of as 
troiomy to which i have already referred shows that 
in that science — the most complete which has yet ex 
isted — the history of the science has gone on as to its 
general movement in accordance with the view which 
bacon’s sagacity enjoined the successive generaliza 
tions far as tjieywere ntewere made by successive 
generations i conceive also that the inductive table of 
optics shows the same thing and this vdthoiit taking 
for granted the truth of the undulatrry theory for 
with regard to all the steps of the progress of the 
science lower than that highest one there is i con 
ceive no controversy

mill more especially refers to it as a case in which the

highest generalizations for example the iaws of mo 
tion were those earliest ascertained with any scientific 
exactness will i think on a more careful examination 
of its history be found remarkably to confirm ihvcon’s 
view for in that science we have in the firat place 
very conspicuous examples of the vice of the method 
pursued by the ancients in flying to the highest gene 
ralizations first as when they me their false distinc 
tions of the laws of naiural and violent motions and of 
terrestrial and celestial motions many erroneous laws 
of motion were asserted through neglect of facts or 
want of experiments and when lalileo and his school 
had in some measure succeeded in discovering some of 
the true laws of the motions of terrestrial bodies thc’ 
did not at once assert them as general for they did 
not at all apply those laws to the celestial motions 
as i have remarked all kepler’s speculations respect 
ing the causes of the motions of the planets went upon 
the supposition that the first law of terrestiial motion 
did not apply to celestial bodies but that on the con 
trary some continual force was requisite to keep up 
as well as to originate the planetary motions nor 
did descartes though he enunciated the laws of 
motion with more generality than his predecessors 
but not with exactness venture to tnist the planets 
to those laws on the contraryj te invented his ma 
chineiy of vortices in order to keep up the motions 
of the heavenly bodies newjoii was tlie first who 
extended the laws of terrestrial motion to the celestial 
spac and in doing so he used all the laws of the 
celestial motions which had previously been disebvered 
by more limited inductions to these instances i may 
add the gradual generalization of the third law of mo 
tion by huyghens the bemoullis and herman which 
i hav described in the history as preceding that 
period of peduction to which the succeeding naitative 
 is appropriated in mechanics then we have a cardi 
nal example of the historically gradual and successive

ascent of science from particulars to the most general 
lawb 

 the science of hydrostatics may appear to 
offer a more favourable example of the ascent to the 
most general laws without going through the inter 
mediate iarticular laws and it is true with reference 
to this science as i have observed that it does exhibit 
the pecfuliarity of our possessing the most geneml 
principles on which the phenonuma depend aiul from 
which many cases of special facts are cxlained by 
deduction while other cases cannot be so explained 
from the want of principles intermediate between the 
highest and the lowest and t have assigned as the 
reason of this peculiarity that the general principles 
of the mechanics of fluids avere not obtained avith 
lefevence to the science itself but by extension from 
the sister science of the mechanics of solids the 
two sciences are parts of the same jnductivo ryniiiiid 
and having reached the summit of this pyramid on 
one side we are tempted to descend on the other from 
the liighest generality to moj’e narrow laws yet even 
ill this science the best jiart of our knowledge is 
mainly composed of inductive laws obtained by in 
ductive examination of particular chusses of facts the 
mere riiaiheinaticaljjnvestigations of the laavs of avaves 
for instance have iiotr iwl to any results so valuable as 
the experimental roseavches of bremonticr emy the 
webers and mr scott russell and in like manner 
in acoustics the mechanics of elastic fluids the 
deductions of mathematicians made on general princi 
ples have not done so much hr our knowledge as 
the cases of vibrations of plates and pipes examined 
experimentally by chladni saa’art mr wheatstono 
and mr willis we see therefore even in these 
sciences no roiison to slight the wisdom which exhorts 
us to ascend fiom particulars to intermediate laws 
rather than to hope to deduce those latter better from 
the more general laws obtained once for all

i mr mill himself indeed notwithstanding that 
he slights bacon’s injunction to seek knowledge by 
proceeding from less general to more general laws 
has given a very good reason why this is commonly 
necessary and wise he says ii “before wh 
attempt to explain deductively from more general laws 
any new class of phenomena it is desirable to have 
gone as far as is practicable in ascertaining the em 
pirical laws of these phenomena so as to compate the 
results of deduction not with one individual instance 
after another but with general propositions expressive 
of the points of agreement which have been found 
among many instances for” he adds with gieat 
justice “if newton had been obliged to verify the 
theory of gravitation not by deducing fiom it keplers 
laws but by deducing all the observed planetary posi 
tions which had served kepler to establish those laws 
the newtonian theory would probably never have 
emerged from the state of an hypothesis” to which 
we may add that it is certain from the history of the 
subject that in that case the hypothesis would never 
have been fiumed at all 

x mr milvs hope from deduction — mr 
mill expresses a hope of the eflscacy of deduction 
rather than induction in promojing the future pro 
gress of science which hope so far as the physical 
sciences are concenied apears to me at variance with 
all the lessons of the history of those sciences he 
says i “that the advances henceforth to be 
expected even in physical and still more in mental and 
social science will be chiefly the result of deduction 
is evident from the geneial considerations already 
adduced’ these considerations being that the phe 
nomena to be considered are very complex and are 
the result of many known causes of which we have 
to disentangle the results 

 i cannot lut take a very different view from 
this i think that any one looking at the state of 
physical science will see that there are still a vast 
mass of cases in which we do not at all know the 
causes at least in their full generality and that the 



mr mill’s logic 


 

knowledge of new causes and the generalization of 
the laws of those already known can only be obtained 
by new imludive discoveries except by new in 
ductions equal in their efficacy for grouping together 
phenomena in new points of view to any which have 
yet been performed in the history of science how are 
mr© to solve such questions as those which in the 
survey of what we already know force themselves 
upon our minds such as to take only a few of 
the most obvious examples — what is the nature of 
the connexion of heat and light how does heat 
produce the expansion liquelkction and vaporization 
of bodies what is the nature of the connexion 
between the optical and the chemical properties of 
light what is the relation between optical crystal 
line and chemical polarity what is the connexion 
between the atomic constitution and the physical quali 
ties of bodies what is the tenable detinition of a 
mineral species what is the tine relation of the 
apparently different tyes of vegetable life monoco 
tyledons dicotyledons and cjptogamous plants 
what is the relation of the various types of animal 
life vertebrates articulates radiates c what is 
the number and what are the distinctions of the vital 
powers what is the internal constitution of the 
earth these aia many other questions of equal 
interest no one i suppose expects to see solved by 
deduction from principles already known but we 
can in many of them see good hope of progreas by 
a large use of induction including of course copious 
and careful experiments and observations 

 with such questions before us as have now 
been suggested can see nothing but a most mischiev 
ous narrowing of the field and enfeebling of the spirit 
of scientific exertion in the doctrine that ‘dedhetion 
is the great scientific work of the present and of future 
ages” and that revolution is peaceably and pro 
gressively effecting itself in philosophy the reverse of 
that to which bacon has attached his name i trust 
on the contraij that we have many new laws of 
nature still to dimver j and tibat our race is destined 



 philosophy op discovery 

to obtain a sight of wider truths than any we yet dis 
cern including as cases the general laws we now 
know and obtained from these known laws as they 
must be by induction 

 i can see however reasons for the compar 
tively greater favour with which mr mill lofks upoh 
deduction in the views to which he hfis mainly directed 
his attention the explanation of remarkable pheno 
mena by known laws of nature has as have already 
said a greater charm fcr many minds than the dis 
covery of the laws themselves in the case of such 
explanations the pioblem proposed is moie definite 
and the solution hiorc obviously complete for the 
process of induction includes a mysterious step by 
which we pass from particulars to generals of which 
step the reason always seems to b inadequately ren 
dered by any words which we can ilse and this step 
to most minds is not deiuonstmtive as to few is it 
given to jierform it on a great scale but the process 
of explanation of facts by known laws is deductive ami 
has at every step a ftree like that of demonstration 
producing a feeling peculiarly gratifying to the clear 
intellects which are most capable of following the 
process we may often see instances in which this 
admiration for deductive skill appears in an extrava 
gant measure as when men compare laplace with 
newton nor should lthink it my business to argue 
against such a preference unless it were likely to leave 
us too well satisfied with what we know alremly to 
chill our hope of scientific progress and to prevent our 
making any further strenuous efforts to ascend higher 
than we have yot done the mountairichain which 
limits human knowledge 

 but there another reason which i conceive 
operates in leading mr mill to look to deduction as 
the principal means of future progress in knowledget 
and which is a reason of considerable weight in 
subjects of research which as i conceive he mainly 
has in view in the study of our own minds and of 
the laws which govern the history of society i do not 
think that it is very likely that we shall hereafter

arrive at any wider principlas than those of which we 
already possess some considerable knowledge and this 
for a special ieason namely that our knowledge in 
such cases is not gathered by mere external observation 
of a collection of external facts but acquired by atten 
tion to internal facts our own emotions thoughts and 
spiings of actit facts are conntctel by ties existing 
in our own consciousness and not in mere observed 
juxtaposition succession or similitude how the 
character for instance is inllliencod by vlirious causes 
an qxainple to which mr mill repeatedly refers ii 
 c is an impiiry which niay perhaps be best 
conducted by consideiing what we know of the influ 
ence of education and habit government and occupa 
tion hope and fear vanity anti pride and the like 
upon men’s characters and by tracing the various 
eftects of the inttjrmixture of such influences yet 
even here there seems to be room for the disco veiy of 
in the way of experimental inquiry for instance 
yhat share race or family has in the fonnation of 
character a question which can hardly be solved to 
any purpose in any other way than by collecting and 
classing instances and in the same way many of 
the principles which regulate the material wealth of 
states are obtain edi if not exclusively at least most 
clearly and securely by induction from largo surveys 
of facts still however i am quite ready to admit 
that in mentfil and social science we are much less 
likely thanin physical science to obtain new truths 
by any process which can be distinctively tercaed n 
duction and that iniihose sciences what may be called 
deductions from principles of thought and action of 
which we are already conscious or to which we assent 
when they are felicitously picked out of our thoughts 
and put into words must have a lai‘ge share and i 
may add that this observation of mr mill appears to 
me to be important and its present connexion new 

xi fiiridamental opposition of our doctrines — 
 i have made nearly all the remarks which i 
now think it of any consequence to make upon mr

tained in my lliatory and fhiloaophg and yet tliere

remains still untouched one great question involving 
probably the widest of all the differences between him 
and me i mean the question whether geometrical 
axioms and as similar in their evidence to tliese au 
axioms bo tniths derived from experience or be neces 
sary truths in some deeper sense this is one of the 
fitndamontal questions of philosophy and all persons 
who take an interest in metaphysical discussions know 
that the two opposite opinions have been maintained 
with great zeal in all ages of speculation to me it 
appears that there are two distinct elements in our 
knowlerlg experience without and the mind with 
in mr mill derives all our knowledge from exieri 
ence alone in a question thus going the root of all 
knowledge the opposite argunmnts must needs cut deep 
on both sides mr mill cannot deny that our know 
ledge of geometrical axioms and the like seems to be 
necessary i cannot deny that our knowledge axiomatic 
as well as other clever is icquired withoiu experienoe 
g perhaps ordinary readers may despair of fob 
lowing our icasonings when they find that they can 
only be made intelligible by supposing on tjie one 
hand a person who thinks distinctly and yet has never 
seen or felt any external object and on the otlier 
hand a person who is transferred is mr mill supposes 
ii jj to “distant parts of the stellar regions where 
the henomena may lo entirely unlike those with 
which we arc acquainted” and where eventhe axiom 
that every effect must have a ciiuse docs not hold good 
nor in truth do think it necessary hero to spend 
many words on this subject probably for those wlio 
take an interest in this discussion most of the argu 
ments on each side have already been put foiwards with 
sufficient repetition t have in an “essay on the 
fundamental antithesis of philosophy” and in some 
accompanying “ remarks” printed at the end of the 
second edition o£ my philosophyy given my reply to 
what has been fifaid on this subject both by mr mill 
and by the author of u very able critique on my his

umj and philosophy which appeared in the quarterly 
revmo in and i will not here attempt to revive 
the general discussion 

 perhaps may be allowed to notice that in 
one part of mr mill’s work where this subject is 
treated there is the appearance of one of the parties 
to the controversy pronouncing judgment in his own 
cause tliis indeed is a temptation which it is especi 
ally difficult for an author to resisi who writes a 
treatise upon fallacies the subject of mr mill’s fifth 
book in such a treatise the writer has an easy way 
of disposing of adverse opinions by classing them as 
“ fallacies ” and putting them side by side with opini 
ons universally acknowledged to bo false in tliis way 
mr mill has dealt with several points which are still 
as i conceive matters of controversy ii c 

 but undoubtedly mr mill has given his 
argument against my opinions with great distinct 
ness in another place i in order to show 
that it is merely habitual association which gives 
to an experimental truth the character of a neces 
sary truth he quotes the case of the laws of motion 
which were really discovered from experiment but are 
now looked upon as tbe only conceivable laws and 
esjiecially what he jonceives as “ the rediictio ad ah 
mrdum of the theory of incoiiceivableness” an opinion 
which had ventured to throw out that if we could 
conceive the composition f bodies distinctly we might 
bo able to see that it is necessary that the modes of 
their composition should be definite i do nqji think 
that readers in general will see anything absurd in 
the opinion that the laws of mechanics and even the 
laws of the chemical composition of bodies may de 
pend updn principles as necessary as tbe prtperties of 
space and number and that this nec€issity though not 
at all perceived by persons who have only the ordinary 
obscure and ponfused notions bn such subjects may be 
evident to a mind which by effbiii and discipline 
rendered its ideas of mechanical causation elementary 
compositioh and difference of kind clear and precise 
it may easily be i oonceive that while such necessary

priaciples perceived to be necoshary only by a few 
minds of highly cultivated insight such principles as 
the axioms of oeometry and arithmetic may per 
ceived to be necessary by all minds which have any 
habit of abstract thought at all and i conceive also 
that though these axioms are brought into distinct 
view by a certain degree of intelleutnal cultivation 
they may still bo much better described as conditions 
of experience than as results of experience — as laws 
of the mind and of its activit rather than as facts 
impressed upon a mind merely jasive

will not pursue the subject furtlnt only as the ques 
tion has atiscii lespectiiig the absiirililieri to which 
each of the opposite doct lines leads i will point out 
opinions connected witli tliis subject which mr iviill 
has stated in various arts of his book 

he holds i that it is merely fiom habit that 
we are unable to conceive the laisf point of space or 
the last instant of time he holds li that it is 
strange that any one should rely ujon the d priori 
evidence that space or extension is inhnite or that no 
thing can be mode of nothing he holds i that 
the first law of motion is rigorously true but that the 
axioms respecting tho lever are oiayapproxlmatel y true 
he holds ii no that there may he sidereal firma 
ments in which events succeed each other at random 
without obeying any laws of causation although on© 
might suppose that even if sjmictj and cause are both to 
have tlieir limits still they might terminate together 
and then even on this bold supposition we should no 
where have a world in which events wore casual he 
holds ii ill that the aiom that every event must 
have a cause is established by means of an “ induction 
by simple enumeration and in like manner that 
the principles of number and oi geometiy are proved 
by this method of simple enumeration alone ho 
ascribes the proof i of the axiom things which 
are equal to the same are equal to each other’ to tho 
fact it this proposition has been perpetually 
true and neer fiilsc he holds that all

political economy as an inductive science 


morat sciences — i both m comte and mr mill 
in speaking of the methods of advancing science aim as 
 have saij at the extension of their methods moral 
subjects and aspire to suggest means foi the augmen 
tation of our knowledge of ethical olitical and social 
truths i have not here ventured upon a like exten 
sion of my conclusions because i wished to confine my 
views of the philosophy of discovery to the cases in 
which all allow that solid and permanent discoveries 
have been made moreover in the case of moral spe 
culations wo have to consider not only observed exter 
nal facts and the ideas by which they are colligated 
but also internal facts in which the instrument of 
observation is consciousness and in which observations 
and ideas are mingled together and act and react in a 
peculiar manner it may therefoio be doubted whether 
the methods which have been effectual in the discovery 
of physical theories will not reqmre to bo greatly mo 
dified or replaced by processes altogether different 
when we would make advances in ethical political or 
social knowledge in ethics at least it seems plain 
that we must te our startingpoint not without but 
within us our mental powers our affbetions our rea 
son and any other faculties which wo have must be the 
basis of our convictions and in this field of know 
ledge the veiy form of our highest propositions is dif 
ferent from what it is in the physical sciences in 
physics we examine what s in a form more or kss 
general in ethics we seek to determine what ouoht 
io be as the highest rule which is supreme over all 



•political economy 

others in this case we cannot expect the methods of 
physical discovery to aid ns 

but others of the subjects which i have mentioned 
though strongly marked and influenced by this ethical 
element are still of a mixed character and require 
also observation of external facts of human individual 
and social conduct and generalizations derived from 
such observations tlie facts of political constitutions 
and social relations in communities of men and the 
histories of such communities afford large bodies of 
materials for political and social science and it seems 
not at all unlikely tliat such science may bo governed 
in its formation and progress by laws like those which 
govern the physical sciences and may be steered clear 
of errora and directed towards truths by an attention 
to the foims which error and truth have assumed in 
the most stable and ceitain sciences the different 
forms of society and the principal motives which ope 
rate upon men regarded in masses may be classifled 
as cts and though our consciousness of what we our 
selves are and the afiectlons which we ourselves feel 
are always at work in our inteqretations of such facts 
yet the knowledge which we thus obtain may lead us 
to bodies of knowledge which we may call sciences 
and compare withthe other sciences as to their form 
and maxims 

poluical economy — among such bodies of 
knowledge i may notice as a specimen the science of 
poluical economy and may compare it with other 
sciences in the respects which have been referred to 

m oomte has given a few pages to the discussion of 
this science of political economy but what he has 
said amounts only to a few tague remarks on adam 
smith and destutt de tracy his main object being 
it would seem to introduce ida usual formula and to 
condemn all that has hitherto been done with whioh 
there is no evidence that he is adequately acquaiiited 
ba worthless because it is theological” ‘metaphysi 
oal” “literaiy” and not positive 


 



 philosophy op discovery 

mr mill has much more distinctly chaxaoterhsed the 
plan and form of political economy in his system 
he regaids this science as that which deals with the 
results which take place in human society in conse 
quence of the desire of wealth he explains however 
that it is only for the sake of convenience that one of 
the motives which opciute upon man is thus insulated 
and treated as if it were the only one — that there are 
other principles for instance the riiiciples on which 
the progress of population depends which cooperate 
with the main principle and materially modify its re 
sults and ho gives reasons why this mode of simplify 
ing the study of social henornciia tends to promote 
the progress of systematic knowledge 

instead of discussing these reasons i will notice the 
way in which the speculations of political economists 
have exemlified tendencies to error and corrections 
of those tendencies of the siuno nature as those 
which we have already noticed in seaking of other 
sciences 

wages frofitsy and meni — we may regard as 
one of the iirst imxrtant steps in this science adam 
smith’s remark that the value or price of any article 
bought and sold consists of three elements wagesy profitby 
and bent some of the most imxilant of subsequent 
speculations were attempts to determine the laws of each 
of these three elements at hrst it might be supposed 
that there ought to be added to them a fourth element 
materieds but upon consideration it will be seen that 
materialsi as an element of price resolves itself into 
wages and rent for all materials derive their value 
from tho labour which is bestowed upon them the 
iron of the ploughshare costs just what it costs to sink

thatis speaking loosely the population and tue amount 
of money which is devoted to the payment of wages 
and what determines the population it was replied 
— the means of subsistence and how does the popu 
lation tend to increase — in a geometrical ratio and 
how does the subsistence tend to increase — at most in 
an arithmetical ratio and hence it was inferred tliat 
the population tends constantly to run beyond tlie 
means of subsistence and will bo limited by a threat 
ened deficiency of these means and the wages paid 
must be such as to form this limit and therefore the 
wages paid will always be such as just to keei up the 
population in its ordinary state of progress here 
was one general proposition which was gathered fixm 
summary observations of society 

again as to rent adam smith had treated rent 
as if it were a monopoly price — tlie result of a mono 
poly of the land by the landowners but subsequent 
writem acutely remarked that land is of various de 
grees of fertility and there is souie land which rely 
pays the cultivator if cultivating it he pay no rent 
and rent can be afforded for other land only in so far 
as it is better than this bad land and thus there 
was obtained another general proposition tliat the 
bent of good lamj was just equal to the excess of its 
produce over the worat cultivable land 

how these two propositions are examples of a hasty 
and premature gejieinlization like that from which 
the sweeping physical systems of antiquity were de 
rived they were examples of that process which 
francis bacon calls anticipation in which we leap at 
once from a few facts to propositions of the highest 
generality and supposing these to be securely estar 
blished proceed to draw a body of conclusions from 
them and thus frame a system 

apd what is the sounder and wiser mode of pro 
eeeding in order to obtain a science of such things 
we must classify the facts which we observe and take 
care that we do not asmbe to the cts in our imme 
diate neighbourhood or iegially under our notice a 
gmiiality of prevalence iuch does not belong to

tjbiltob we must proceed by the ladder of inducuoii 
and be sure we have obtain the najrrower generalisftt 
tioiia before wo aspire to the widest 

correction of them by induction bent — por in 
stance in the case of the latter of the alve two pro 
pqsitioiis — that bent is the excess of the produce of 
good soils over the worst — that is the case in england 
and scotland but is it the case in other countries 
let us see why is it the case in england because 
if the rent demanded for good land were nuyre than the 
excess of the produce over bad land the farmer would 
prefer the bad land as more gainful if the rent de 
manded for gocxi land were less than the excess the 
bad land would be abandoned by the farmer 

but all this goes upon the supposition that the far 
mer can remove from good land to bad or from bad to 
good or apply his capital in some other way than 
farming according as it is more gainful this is true 
in england but is it true all over the world 

by no means it is true in scarcely any other part 
of the world in almost every other part of the world 
the cultivator is bound to the land so that he cannot 
remove himself and his capital from it and cannot 
because he is not satisfied with his position upon it 
seek and find a position and a subsistence elsewhere 
on the contraiy he is bound by the laws and customs 
of the countiy by constitution history and character 
so that he cannot or can only with great difisiculty 
change his plan and mode of life and thus over 
great part of the world the fundamental supposition on 
which resls the above generalization respecting bent is 
altogether fidse 

 able political economist” has taken the step 
which as we have said sound philosophy would have 
prescribed he has classified the states of society which 
exist or have existed on the earth as they bear on this 
point the amount of bent he has classified the 
modes in which the produce is in different countries

and different stages of society divided between tho 
cultivator and the proprietor and he finds tht the na 
tural divisions are these iser jrmu that is labour 
rents paid by the cultivator to the landowner as in 
bussia metayer rente where the produce is divided be 
tween the cultivator and the landowner as in central 
europe ryot renta where a portion of the produce is 
paid to the sovereign as landlord as in india cottier 
jrerttib where a moneyrent is paid b a cultivator who 
raises his own subsistence from the soil and rwrmeri 
rents where a covenanted bent is paid by a person 
employing labourers in this last case alone is it true 
that the bent is equal to the excess of good over bad 
soils 

the error of the conclusion in this case arises from 
assuming the mobility of capital and labour in cases in 
which it is not moveable which is mucli as if mecha 
nicians had reasoned respecting rigid bodies supposing 
them to be fluid bodies 

but the error of method was in not classifying the 
facts of societies before jumping to a conclusion which 
was to be applicable to all societies 

 weiges — and in like manner there is an error of 
the same kind in the assertion of the other general 
principles • — that wages are determined by the capital 
which is foidihcoming for the payment of wages and 
that population is determined in its progress by wages 
for there is a vast mass of population on the surface 
of the earth which does not live upon wages and 
though in england the greater part of the peqple lives 
upon wages in the rest of the world the part that 
does so is small and in this case as in the other 
we must class these facts os they exist in different 
nations before we can make assertions of any wide 
generality 

mn jones classed the condition of labourers iu dif 
ferent countries in the same inductive manner in which 
 classed the tenure of land he pointed oat that

there are three broad distinct classes of them unhired 
labowrersf who cultivate the ground wliich they oc 
cupy and live on adfproduced rioagea paid depeiid 
antsy wiio are paid out of the revenva or income of 
their employers as the military retaineis and domestic 
artizanb of feudal times in europe and the greater 
part of the people of asia at the present day and 
 hirtfd labourers who are paid wages from capital 

this last class though taken as belonging to the 
normal condition of society by many political econo 
mists is really the excopiionaj case taking the world 
at large and no propositions concerning the structure 
and iolations of muks in society can have any wide 
generality which are founded on a consideration of 
this ciso alone 

population — and again with regard to the pro 
position that the progress of pupuhitiou depends meiely 
on the rate of wages a very little observation of dif 
ferent communities and of the same communities at 
different times will show that this is a very rash and 
hasty generalization when wages rise whether or 
not population shall undergo a coitcsponding incjtjase 
depends upon many other circumstances besides this 
single fact of the increase of wages the efhct of a 
rise of wages ukn jopulation is aected by the form 
of the wages the time occupied by the change the 
institutions of the society under consideration and 
other causes and a due classification of the conditions 
of the society according to these circumstances is rer 
quisite in order to obtain any general proposition con 
cerning fhe effect of a rise or fall of wages upon the 
progress of the pojmlation 

and thus those precepts of the philosophy of dis 
covery which we have icpeated so often which are so 
simple and which seem so obvious have been neg 
lected or violated in the outset of political economy 
as in so many other sciences — namely the precepts 
that we must classify our facts before we generali 
and seek for narrower generalizations and inductions 
before we aim at the widest if these maxims hod 
been obeyed they would have saved the earlier spoon

lators on this subject from some splendid errors but 
on the other hand it may bo said that if these earlier 
speculators had not bn thus bold the science could 
not so soon have assumed that large and striking form 
which mode it so attractive and to which it probably 
owes a large part of its progress 



chapter xxiv 
modern gerhan philosophy 


i science is tke idealization of facte 

i have spoken a few chapters back of the reao 
tion against the doctrines of the sensational school in 
england and france in germany also there was a 
reaction against these doctrines — but there this move 
ment took a direction different from its direction in 
other countries omitting many other names kant 
fichte schelling and hegel may be regarded as the 
writers who mark in a prominent maimer this ger 
manic line of speculation the problem of philosophy 
in the way in which they conceived it may best be ex 
plained by reference to that fundamental antithesis of 
which i had occasion to speak in the uistory of scimtyw 
ideas and in order to characterize the steps taken 
by these modem german philosophers i must return 
to what have said concerning the fundamental 
antithesis 

this antithesis as i have there remarked is stated 
in various ways — as the antithesis of thoughts and 
things of ideas and sensations of theory and facts 
of necessary truth and experience of the subjective 
and objective elements of our knowledge and in other 
phrases have further remarked that the elements 
thus spoken of though opposed are inseparable we 
cannot have the one without the other we cannot 
have thoughts without thinking of things we can 
not have things before us without thinking of them

modern german philosophy oi 

ftthher it been shown i conceive that our 
knowledge derives from the former of these two ele 
ments namely our ideas itis form and character of 
knowledge our ideas being the necessary form of 
knowledge while the mamer of our knowledge in each 
case is supplied by the apropriate perception or out 
ward experience 

thus our ideas of spaee and time are the neces 
sary forms of our geometrical and arithmetical know 
ledge and no sensations or experience are needed as 
the matter of such knowledge except in so far as sen 
sation and experience are needed to evoke our ideas in 
way degrea and hence these sciences are sometimes 
caued formal sciences all other scicucfs involve 
along with the experience and observation ajipropriate 
to each a development of the ideal conditions of know 
ledge existing in our minds and i have given the 
history both of this development of ideas and of the 
matter derived from experience in two former works 
the llistory of hcimtifc ideas and the history of tlie 
inductive sciences i havo there traced this history 
through the whole body of the physical sciences 

but though ideas and perceptions arc thus separate 
elements in our philosophy they cannot in fact be 
distinguished andi separated but aro different aspects 
of the same tiling and the only way in which we can 
approach to truth is by gradually and successively in 
one instance after another advancing from the xicep 
tion to the idea from the fact to the theoiy 

 i would now further observe that in this pro 
gression from fact to theory we advance when the 
theory is complete and completely xiosseased by the 
mind firom the apprehension of truths as to 

the apprehension of them as necessary and thus facts 
which were originally observed merely as facts become 
the consequences of theory and are thus brought with 
in the domain of ideas that which was a part of the 
objective world becomes also a part of the subjective 
world a necessary part of the thoughts of the theorist 
and in this way the progress of true theoiy is the 
idealizahon qf fetets 



 philosophy op discovery 

thus the progress of science consists in a per 
petiud reduction of facts to ideiis portions are per 
etually transferred fiom one side to another of the 
fundamental antithesis namely from the objective 
to the subjective side the centre or fulcrum of the 
antithesis is sliifteil by every movement which is 
made in the advance of science and is shifted so that 
the ideal side gains something from the real side 

 i will proceed to illustrate this proposition a 
little further necessary truths belong to the sub 
jective obseiwod facts to the jective side of our 
knowledge now in the progress of that exact 
speculative knowledge wliieh wo call science facts 
which were at a jirevioua period merely oiscrvcd 
facts come to be known as neceasary truths and 
the attempts at new advances in science generally 
introduce the representation of known truths of fact 
as included in higher and wider truths and therefore 
so far necessary 

we may exemplify this progress in the history 
of the science of imechanics thus the property of the 
lever the inverse proportion of the freights and arms 
was known as i fact before the time of aristotle and 
known as no more for he gives many taiitastical and 
inapplicable reasons for tbe fact bit in the writings 
of archimedes we find this fact brought within the 
domain of necessary truth it was there transferred 
from the empirical to the ideal side of the fundar 
mental antithesis and thus a progressive step was 
made in science in like manner it was at first 
taken by galileo as a mere foot of experience that in 
a falling body the velocity increases in proportion 
the time but his followers have seen in this the 
necessary effect of the uniform force ofjjvity in 
like manner kepler’s empuical laws vere shown by 
newton to be necessary results of a central force 
attracting inversely as the square of the distance 
and if it be still even at present doubtful wheitfir 
this is the necessary hm of a central forc as some 
philosophers have filainwned that it isi tre cannot 
doubt that if mow or hereafter tiliose phlloscpheri 



modern german philosophy 

could establish their doctrine as certain they would 
make on important step in science in addition to 
those already made 

and thus such steps in science arc made whenever 
empirical facta are discerned to be neceasaiy laws or 
if i may be allowed to use a briefer expression when 
ever acls are idealized 

 in oider to show low widely this statement is 
applicabie i will exemplify it in hjine of the other 
scienccs 

in chemistry not to speak of earlier stops in 
the science which might be presented as instances of 
the same genend process we may remark that the 
analyses of various compounds into their elements 
accorrling to the quantity of the elements fonn a vast 
multitude of facts which were previously einpiiical 
only but wliich are reduced to a law and therefore 
to a certain kind of ideal necessity by the discovery 
of their being comiounded acconling to definite and 
multijde proportions and again this very law of 
definite proportions which may at first be taken as 
a law given by experience only it has been attempted 
to make into a iiecessaiy truth by asserting that 
bodies must necessarily consist of atoms and atoms 
must necessarily jombine in definite small numbers 
and however doubtful this atomic theory may at 
present be it will not be questioned that any chemical 
hilosopher who could establish it or any other 
theory which would produce an equivalent change 
in the aspect of the science would mako a great 
scientific advance and thus in tliis science also 
the progress of science consists in the transfer of 
fislcts firom the empirical to the necessary side of 
the antithesis or as it was before expressed in the 
idealmation of cts 

 we may illustrate the same process in the 
natural history sciences the discovery of the 
prinoiple of morphology in plants was the reduction 
of a vast mass of facts to a idea as schiller said 
to qdthe when he explained the discovoty although 
the latter cheiiing a horror of the term 



 peilpht op biscotjeet 

whdbt perliaps is quite as commoa in as iu 

qemany was extremely vexed at being told tbat he 
possessed such furniture in his mind the applioatiims 
of this principle to special cases for instance to 
euphorbia by brown to beseda by lindley have 
been attempts to idealize the facts of these special 
oases 

 we may apply th same view to steps in 
science which are still under discussion — the question 
being whether an advance has really been made iif 
science or not for instance in astronomy the 
nebular hypothesis has been propounded as an 
explanation of many of the observed phenomena of 
the universe if this hypothesis could be conceived 
eyjfc to be established as a true theory this must be 
dme by its taking into itself as necessary parts of 
the whole idea many facts which have already been 
observed such as the various form of nebulse — many 
facts which it must require a long course of years to 
observe such as tlic changes of nebulm from one form 
to another — and many facts which so fiir as we can 
at present judge are utterly at variance with the idea 
such as the motions of satellites the relations of the 
material elements of planets the existence of vegetable 
and animal life uon their surfaces but if all these 
facts when ftiuy studied should appear to be in 
daded in the general idea of nebular condensation 
according to laws of nature the facts so 
idealized would undoubtedly congtituto a very remark 
able advance in science but then we are to recollect 
that we are not to suppose that the facts will agree 
with the ide merely because the idea considered hy 
itself and without carefully attending to the faets is 
a large and striking idea and we are also to re 
collect that the facts ma be compared with anoth 
idea no less large and striking and that if we take 
into our account as in forming an idea of the couim 
of the universe we must do not only vegetaut iid 
animal but aho human life this other idea 
likely to take into it a r larger portion of the known 
facts than the idea of the nebular hypothesise 



mobbbk omuajsf pbilosopht 

tm other idea iirhich speak of ja the idea of man 
as the principal object in the creation to mhose 
sufltenance and devopment the other parts of the 
tjnmrse are subservient as means to an end and 
although in oiir attempts to include all known facts 
in this idea we again meet with many difficulttea 
and find many trains of facts which have no apparent 
odngruity with the idea yet we may say that 
taking into account the facts of mans mtollectual 
dnd moral condition and his history as well as 
the mere facts of the material world the di€i 
culties and apparent incongruities aie far less 
when we attempt to idealize the facts by reference 
to this idea of man as the end of creation than ac 
cording to the other idea of the world as tie 
result of nebular condensation without any conce 
able ebid or purpose i am now of course merely 
comparing these two views of the universe os sup 
posed steps ill science according to the general notion 
which have just been endeavouring to explain that 
a step in science is some idealization of facts 

 perhaps it will be objected tliat what i have 
said of the idealization of facts as tho manner in 
which the progress of science goes on amounts to 
no more than the uual expressions that the progress 
of science consists in reducing facts to theories 
and to this t reply that the advantage at which i 
aim by the expression which i have used is this to 
remind the reader fact and theory in every 
subject are not marked by separate and prominent 
features of difference but only by their present 
opposition which is a transient relation they are 
related to each other no otherwise than as the poles 
of the fundamental antithesis the point which 
separates those poles shifts with every advance of 
science and then what vras theory becomes fact 
as i have already said elsewhere a true theory is a 
fact a fact is a familiar theoxy j£ we bear this 
in mind we express the view on which i am new 
inaistmg ww we say that the progress ef soimee 
comets in reducing facts to theories but i think 

 x 



 o philosophy op disoovbbt 

tiiat speaking of ideas as opposed to facts ve express 
more pointedly the original antithesis and the 
subsequent identifioation of the facts with the idea 
the expression appears to be simple and apt when 
wo say for instance that the facts of geography are 
identified with the idea of globular eartli the facts 
of planetiiry astronomy with tlic idea of the helio 
centric system and ultimately with tlio idea of uni 
versal gravitation 

 we may further remark that though by suc 
cessive ateis in science successm facts are reduced 
to ideas this process can never be complete how 
ever the joint may shift which bcpaiates the two 
poles the two xlcs will always remain however 
fiir the ideal element may extend there will always 
be something beyond it llowever fu the jdienomena 
may bo idealized there will always remain some 
wliicji are not idealized and whicli are mere pheno 
mena this also is implied by mjikiiig our expressions 
refer to tlie fumlameiiial antithchis for because the 
antithesis is fundamental its two elements will 
always be present j the objective as well as the 
subjective and thus in the contemplation of the 
universe however much we understand there must 
always be something which wc jlo not understand 
however far we may trace necessary timths there 
must always bo things which are to our apprehension 
arbitrary howev‘r far we may extend the sphere of 
our internal world in which wo feel power and see 
light it must always be surroimded by our external 
world in which wo see no light and only feel resist 
ance our subjective being is inclosed in an objective 
shell which though it seems to yield to our efforts 
continues entire and impenetrable beyond our reach 
and even enlarges in its extent while it appoars to 
give up to us a portion of its substance 

ii successive germari philosophies 

 the doctrine of the fundamental anuihesis 
of two elements of wmch the union is involved in atl 



modbrn geeman philosophy 

ijcnowledge and of which the separation is the task of 
all philosophy affords us a special and distinct mode 
of criticizing the philosophies which have succeeded 
each other in the world and wo may apply it to the 
german philosophies of which we have soken 

the doctrine of the fundamental antithesis is briefly 
this 

thait in every act of knowledge i tftjere are two 
opposite elements which we nay call ideas and percep 
aons but of which the opposition appears in various 
other antitlieses as thouglits and things theories 
and factsy necessary trxdhs and experiential truths 
and the like that our knowledge derives from the 
former of these elements nawdy our ideasy its form 
and character as knowledge our ideas of space and 
time being the necessary forms for instance of owr 
geometrical and arithnjnetical knowledge and in 
like mayvner all our other knowledge involving a 
develop’ment of the ideal cojiduions of knowledge exists 
ing in our minds hut that though ideas axid per 
eeptions are thus separate elenunts in our philosophy 
they cannot in fact he distingnishsd and separate 
but are different aspects of the saim thing that the 
only way in which we can approach to truth is by 
gradually and successively in one instance after 
amothsr advancing from the perception to the idea 
from the fact to the theory from the apprelmtsion of 
truths as actual ic the apprehension of them as necessary 
 this successive awl various progress from fact to 
theory constitutes the history of science apd tids 
progress though always leading us mover to that 
central unijty of which both the idea and the fact are 
emcmationsf ean never lead us to that point nor to cmy 
msoisurcme proximity to ity or definite cotnprejwifisiofi 
gf its plate and nalure 

to now the doctrine being thus statech succesive 
sentence of the statement contain successive steps of 
german philosophy as it has appeared in the series of 
cebrated authors whom i have named v 

jdea and perceptions or sensations being regarded 
w the two elements of our knowledge locke or at 



 phliiosophy op dibooybet 

least the successors of locke had rejected the former 
element ideas and professed to resolve all our know 
ledge into sensation after this philosophy had pre 
vailed for a time kant exposed to the entire conviction 
of the great body of german speculators the untenable 
nature of this account of our knowledge he taught 
one of tlio first sentences of the above statement 
that owr knowledge derives from our ideas its form 
and character as knowledge our ideas of space and 
time being y for instanecy tie necessary forms of oar geo 
metrical and arithmetical knowledge fichte earned 
still further this view of our knowledge as derived 
from our icleas or from its nature as knowledge and 
held that all oir knowledge is a development of the 
ideal conditions of knowledge existing m ovr minds 
one of our next following sentences but when tlie 
ideal element of our knowledge was thus exclusively 
dwelt upon it was soon seen that this ideal system 
no more gave a complete explanation of the real nature 
of knowledge than the old sensational doctrine had 
done both elements ideas and sensations must bo 
taken into account and this was attempted by 
schelling who in his earlier works taught as wo 
have also stated above that idea and facts 
different aspects of the same ihin — this thing the 
central basis of truth in which both elements are in 
volved and identified being in schelling’s language 
the ahsoluicy while each of the separate elements is 
eubjected to conduions arising from their union but 
this ajisolute being a xint inaccessible to us and 
inconceivable by us as our philosophy teaches as 
above cannot to any purpose be made the basis of 
our philosophy and accordingly this philosophy of 
the absolute has not been more permanent tn its 
predecessors yet the philosophy of hel which 
still has a wide and powerful sway in germany is 
in the main a development of the same prindple as 
that of sdtielling — the identity of the ide toft the 
fact and hogel’s idenmtysystefj is rather a more 
meftodteaand technioajr exposition of schdliug’s 
phttosoph of the atwolute than a new systemi but 



moiern german philosophy o 

hgel traces the manifestation of the identity of the 
idea and tact in the progress of human knowledge 
olid thus in some measure approaches to our doctrine 
above stated that j tits way in wlddk we approach 
to truth is by gradually and successively in one imtance 
after anotltsr that is historically cuii andng from ths 
perception to the idea from the fact to ilte theory while 
at the same time hegel hasnot carried out this view 
in any comprehensive or complete jiuuiuer so as to 
sliow that this pioress constitutes the history of 
science and as with schelhng ids system shows an 
entire want of the conviction above expressed as 
art of our doctrine that we can never in our 
speculations reach or approach to the central imity 
of whidt both idea and fact are emanations 

 this view of the relation of the sensational 
school of the schools of kant fichte schelling and 
hegel and of the fundamental defects of all may be 
further illustrated it will of course le uuderstood 
that our illustratiou is given only as a slight and im 
perfect sketch of these philosophies but their relation 
may perhaps become more apjiarent by the very brevity 
with which it is stated and the object of the present 
chapter is not the detailed criticism of systems but 
this very relation of systems to each other 

the actual and the ideal the external and the in 
ternal elements of knowledge were called by the 
crennans the objective and the subjective elements re 
spectively the forms of knowledge and especially 
space and time were pronounced by kaiit to be 
essentially subjective and this view of the nature 
of knowledge more fully unfolded and extended to 
all knowledge became the sibjective ideality of fichte 
but the subjective and tlie objective are as we 
havq said in their ultimate and supreme fom one 
and hence we are told of the subjectiveobjective a 
phrase which has also been employed by ittr 
coleridge fichte had spoken of the subjective ele 
ment as the me das ich and of the olgective 
element as the ifotme das kichiichlj and has 
deuced the from the me scheling on the 



 pniliosophy op discovert 


contmry laboured with great subtlety to deduce 
the me fiom the ahsohue which includes both and 
this absolute or subjectiveobjective is spoken of by 
schell ing as unfolding itseu into endless other anti 
theses it was held that from the assumption of such 
a principle might be deduced and exjlained the oppo 
sitions which in the contemplation of nature present 
themselves at every step as leading points of gexveral 
philosophy — for example the opjkition of matter as 
passive and active as dead and oryanhedy as nytcon 
adorn or conscious the opposition of individual and 
sipeciss of will and moral rule and this antitlietical 
development was carried further by hegel who taught 
that the aksoliite idea developos itself so as to assume 
qualities limitations and seeming oppositions and 
aen completes the cycle of its develojiuicnt by return 
ing into unity 

 that there is in the history of hcicnce much 
which easily lends iisolf to such a formula the views 
which i have endeavoured to expound show and ex 
emplify in detail but yet the attmnpts to cany this 
view into detail by conjecture — by a sort of divination 
— with little or no attention to the historical progress 
and actual condition of knowledge and such siro those 
which have been made by the philosophers whom i 
have mentioned have led to arbitrary and baseless 
views of almost every branch of knowledge such 
oppositions and differences as arc found to exist in 
nature are assumed as the representatives of the 
elements of neccssarj antitheses in a manner in which 
scientific tiuth and inductive reasoning are altogether 
slighted thus this peculiar and necessary auu 
thetical character is assumed to be displayed in 
attraction and repulsion in contriptal and centrifugal 
forces in a supposed positive and negative electrimtyi 
in a supposed positive and negative magnetism in 
still more doubtful positive and negative elemenf of 
light and heat in the different elements of the atmo 
sphere which are quite groundlessly assumed to have a 
imuliar antithetic chanr in animal and vei 
 able life in the two sei in gravity and li 



omm gbrsean philosophy 

these and many others are given by schelling as 
instances of the radical opposition of forces and ele 
ments which necessarily pervades all nature i con 
ceive that the heterogeneous and eitoneous principles 
involved in these views of the material world show us 
how unsiifo and misleading is the philosophical as 
sumption on which they rest and the triads of

 in these rash and blind attempts to construct

motionless unity next as two principles altogether 
distinct and placed fiont to front in a marked and

fandajqeutal antitheds are altematdtj dwelt upon 
in an exaggerated degree and then confounded the 
sensational school could see in human knowledge 
nothing but facta kant and fichte fixed their atten 
tion almost entirely upon ideas schelling and lliel 
assume the identity of the two a point we never can 
reach as the origin of their philosophy the exter 
nal world in locke’s school was all in all in the 
speculations of kant this external world became a dim 
and unknown region things were acknowledged to 
be soniethmg in themselves but what the philosopher 
could not tell besides the plicionhenon which we 
see ent acknowknlged a nouttienon which we think 
of but this assumption for such it is exercises no 
influence upon his philosophy 

 we may for the sake of illustration imagine to 
ourselves each system of philosophy os a drama in 
which things are the dramatis persona and the idea 
which governs the systcmi is the plot of the drama 
in kant’s drama things in themselves are merely a 
kind of mute personages’ icid ttpocrootro which stand 
on the stage to be pointed at and talked about but 
which do not tell us anything or enter into the action 
of the piece fichte carries this fuiijher and if we go 
on with the same illustration we my say that he makes 
the whole drama into a kind of monologue in which 
the author tolls the story and merely names the 
persons who appear if we would still carry on the 
image we may say that schelling going upon the prin 
ciple that the whole of the drama is merely a progress 
to the lenouemeui which denouement contains the 
result of all the preceding scenes and events stkrts 
with the last scene of the piece and bringing all the 
characters on the stage in their final attitudes would 
elicit the stoiy firom thia while the true mioda of 
proceeding is to follow the drama beene by scene 
learning as much as we can of the action and the 
characters but knowing that we shall not be allowed 
to see the denouement and that to do so is probably 
not the lot of our species on earth so far as any 
philosopher has thus followed the historical progress of 



modern german fhitosopht 

tike grand bptcle offered to the eyes of speculatiye 
moof in which tibe phenomena of nature are the 
scenes and the theoiy of them the plot he has taken 
the comse by which knowledge really has made its ad 
vances but those who have partially done this have 
often like hegel assumed that they had dinned the 
whole eourso and end of the story and have thus 
criticised the scones and the charactois in a spirit 
uite at variance with that by whicli any real insight 
into the import of the representation can be obtained 

if it be asked wliich position we can assign in this 
dramatic illustration to those who ik id that all our 
knowledge is derived from facts only and who reject 
the supposition of ideas we may say that they look 
on with a belief that the drama has no plot and that 
these scenes are improvised without connexion or pur 
pose 

 i will only offer one more illnstration of the 
relative position of those successive philosophies kant 
compares the change which he iatioduced into philoso 
phy to the change which ytipeniicus introduced into 
astronomical theoiy when copernicus found that 
nothing could be made of the phenomena of the hea 
vens so long as everything was maile to tuni round 
the spectator he tped whether the matter might not 
be better explained if he made the spectator turn and 
left tho stars at rest so kant conceives that our 
experience is regulated by our own faculties as the 
phenomena of the heavens are regulated by our own 
motions but accepting and caityiiig out this illus 
tration we may say that kant in explaining the phe 
nomena of tho heavens by means of the motions of the 
earth has almost forgotten that the planets have their 
own proper motions and has given us a system which 
hardly explains anything besides broadest appearances 
such as the annual and daily motions of the sun and 
that fichte appears as if he wislied to deduce all the 
motions of the planet as well as of the sun from the 
conditions of the spectator — while schelling goes to 
the origin of the system like descartes and is not 
oontent to diow how the bodies move without also 



 philosophy op piscovebt 

proving that from some assumed original condition 
all the movements and relations of the system must 
necessarily be what they are it may be that a theory 
which explains how the planets with their orbits and 
accomaniinente hav come into being may offer itself 
to bold spcculatois like those who have framed and 
produced the nebular hypothesis but i need not 
remind my roiiders eithey how prharious such a 
hypothesis is or that if it be capable of being con 
sidered probable its proofs must gradually dawn upoif 
us step by step age after age and that a system of 
doctiiue which assumes siieh a selieme as a certain 
and fundamental truth and deduces the whole of 
astronomy from it must ueeds bo arbitrary and liable 
to the gravest error at every stop such a precarious 
and premature philosophy at best is that of schclling 
and jfcgel especially as applied to those sciences in 
which by the past progress of all sure knowledge we 
are taught what the real aause and progress of know 
ledge is while at the ime time we may allow that all 
those forms of pliilosophy sinco they do recognize the 
condition and motion of the spectator as a necessary 
element in the explanation of the phenomoua are a 
largo advance upon the ptolemaic scheme — the view of 
those who appeal to phenomena alone as the source of 
our knowledge and say tliat the sun the moon and the 
planets move as we see them move and that all further 
theory is imaginary and fantastical

the fundamental antithesis as it exists in the 
mobal wobld 


have hitherto okcn of the fundamental 
• v t antithesis as the ground of our speculations 
concerning the material world at least maiidy wo 
have indeed been led by the physical sciences and es 
pecially by biology tothe borders of psychology we 
have had to consider not only the mechanical etfects of 
muscular contraction but the sensations wliich the 
nerves receive and convey — the way in which sensar 
tioiis become perceptions the way in which perceptions 
determine actions in this manner we have been led 
to the subject of volition or will and this brings us 
to a now field of speculation tlie moral nature of man 
and tliis moral nature is a matter not only of specula 
tive but of piacticjil interest on this subject i shall 
make only a few brief iemarks 

 even in the most purely speculative view the 
moral aspect of man’s nature difters from the aspect oi 
the material universe in this respect that in the 
moral world external events arc governed in some 
measure by the human will when wo speculate 
concerning the laws of material nature we suppose 
that the phenomena of nature follow a coui’sc and 
order which we may perhaps in some measure dis 
cover and understand but which we cannot change 
or control but when we consider man as an agent 
we suppose him able to determine some at least of 
the events of the external world and thus able to 
determine the actions of other men and to lay down 


 



 i philosophy op discovebt 

laws for them he cannot alter the propertied of 
fire and metals stones and fluids air and light but he 
can use fire and steel so as to compel other men’s actions j 
stonewalls and oceanshores so as to control other 
men’s motions gold and gems so as to have a hold on 
other men’s desiros articulate sounds and intelligible 
symbols so as to direct other men’s thoughts and znoyo 
their will there is an external world of facts and 
in this the facts are such as he makes them by his 
acts 

 but besides this there is also standing over 
against this external world of facts an internal world 
of ideas the moral acts without are the results of 
moral ideas within men have an idea of justice for 
instance according to which they are led to external 
acts as to ust force to make a promise to perform a 
contract as individuals or to make war and peace to 
enact laws and to execute them as a nation 

 some such interaal moral idea necessarily ex 
ists along with all properly human actions man feels 
not only pain and anger but indignation and the senti 
inent of ’wrong which feelings imply a moral idea of 
right and wrong again what he thinks of as wrong 
he tries to prevent what he deems right he attempts 
to realize the idea gives a chivacter to the act 
the act embodies the idea in the moral world as in 
tbe natural world the antithesis is universal and in 
separable it is an antithesis of inseparable elements 
in human action there is ever involved the idea of 
what is right and the external act in which this idea 
is in some measure embodied 

 but the moral ideas such as that of justice 
of bightness and the like are always embodied 
completely in the world of external action althofit 
men’s actions are to a great extent governed by se 
ideas of justice bightness and the like for it must 
be recollected that we include in their action lawii 
and the enforcement of laws yet there is a 
portion of human actions which is not govern by sudh 
ideas actions which result from mere desire 
violations of law llliere is a perpetual antithesis 



the antithesis in morals 

iieas and facts whicli is tle fundamexita basis of 
moml as of natural xihilosophy in the former as in 
the latter subject besides what is ideal there is an 
actual which the ideal does not include this actual 
is the region in which the results of mere desire of 
caprice of apparent accident are found it is the 
region of histoiy as opposed to justice it is the 
region of what is as distinct from what ought to be 

 now what i aspecially wish here to remark is 
his — that the progress of man as a moral being con 
sists in a constant extension of the idea into the region 
of facts this progi’ess consists in making human 
actions conform more and more to the moral ideas of 
justice bightness and the like including in hnman 
actioiis as we have said laws the enforcement of 
laws and other collective acts of bodies of men the 
history of man as man consists in this extension of 
moral ideas into the region of facts it is not that 
the actual history of what men do has always consisted 
in such an extension of moral ideas for there has 
ever been in the actual doings of men a large portion 
of facts which had no moral character acts of desire 
deeds of violence transgressions of acknowledged law 
and the like but such events are not a part of the 
genuine progress humanity they do not belong to 
the history of man as man but to the history of map 
as brute on the other hand there are events which 
belong to the history of man as man events which 
belong to the genuine progress of humanity such as 
the establishment of just laws their enfbrcement 
their improvement by introducing into them a fuller 
measure of moral ideas by such means there is a 
constant progress of man as a moral being by this 

of moral ideas there is a constant progress 
of humanity 

 i have made this reflection because it appears 
to me to bring into view on analogy between the pro 
gress of science and the progress of man or of hu 
numity in the sense ja which i have used the term 
in both these lines of prepess facts are more and 
more identified with ideas in both there is a funda 



i philosophy op discovbbt 

mental antithesis of ideas and facsts and progress 
consists in a constant advance of the point whick 
separates the two elements of this antithesis in 
both facts are constantly won over to the domain of 
ideas but still there is a difierence in the two cases 
for in the one case the facts are beyond our control 
wc cannot make them other than they are and all 
that wc can do if we can dp that is to shape our ideas 
so that they shall coincide with the facts and still 
have the manifest connexion which belongs to them arf 
ideas in the other case the facts are to a certain 
extent in our power they are what we tiiake them 
for they are what we do in this cjisc the facts ought 
to come towards the ideas rather than the ideas 
towards the facts as we called the former process 
the idealization of facts we may call this the ecaliza 
tion of ideas and the analogy which i have here 
wished to bring into view may be expressed by saying 
that the progress of physical science consists in a 
constant successive idealization of physical facts and 
the progress of man’s moral being is a constant suc 
cessive bealiziition of moral ideas 

 thus the necessary cocxistence of an objective 
and a subjective element belongs not only to human 
knowledge as was before explained but also to human 
action the objective and the subjective element are 
inseparable in this case as in tlie otlier we have al 
ways the fact of positive law along with the idea of 
absolute justice the facts of gain or loss along 
with the idea of bights the idea of justice is in 
separable from historical facts for justice gives to each 
his own and history determines what that is we 
cannot even conceive justice without society or society’ 
mthout law and thus in the moral and in tiie natur 
world the fundamental antithesis is inseparable even 
in tlught the two elements must always subsist for 
however fetr the moral ideas be realized in the world 
there trill always remain much in tlie world which is 
not conformable to moral ideas oven if it were only 
through its neccesary dependence on an unmoral and 
immoral past as in the physical world so m the 



the antithesis in morals • 

morale however much the ideal sphere expands it is 
surrounded by a region which is not conformable to 
the idea although in one case the expansion takes 
place by educing ideas out of facts in the other by 
pixducing facts from ideas 

i shall hereafter venture to pursue further this 
train of speculation but at present i shall mako some 
remarks on writers who nviy bo regarded as the suc 
cessors amongst ourselves of theso german schools of 
pmlosophy 



chapter xxvt 

of the “philosophy op the iiffum®” 


f 


i n the last chapter but one t stated that schclling 
propounded a philosophy of the absolute the abso 
lute being the original basis of trutli in which the two 
opposite elements ideas and facts are identified and 
that hegel also founded hi philosophy on the identity 
of these two elements these german philosophies 
appear to me as have ventured to intimate of small 
or no value in their bearing on the history of actual 
science i have in the history of the sciences noted 
instances in which tliese wiiters seem to me to miscon 
ceive altogether the nature and meaning of the facts of 
scientific history as where bchelling condemns new 
ton’s opticks cm a fiibric of fallacies and where” hegel 
says that the glory due to kepler has been unjustly 
transferred to newton as it appears to me important 
that english philosupliers should £nu a just estimate 
of hegel’s capacity of judging and pronouncing on this 
subject will print in the appendix a specif discus 
sion of what he has said respecting newton’s dis 
covery of the law of gravitation 

receiitly attempts have been made to explain to 
english rers these interns of german phlloecphyi 
and in these attempts there are some points which may 
deserve our notice as to their bearing on the philosophy 
of science i find some difficulty in discussing these 
attempts for they deal much with phrases which ap 
pear to me to offer no grasp to man’s power of reason 
what for instance is the ahsohute which occsupies m 








phosofht of the inpinitb 

place in these expositions it is as i have 
stated in helliiig the central basis of truth in which 
thipgs and thoughts are united and identified to at 
tempt reason about such an absolute’ appears to 
me to an entire misapprehension of the power of rea 
son again one of the most eminent of the expositors 
has spoken of eh system of this kind as a phuoaophy 
of the unconditioned but what we must asic is the 
unconditioited that which is subject to no con 
ditions is subject to no conditions which distinguish it 
from any thing else and so cannot be a matter of 
thought but again this absolute or unconditioned is 
if i rightly understand said to be described also by 
various other names unity identity y auhstaocej abaofvie 
eauae the infinitcy pure thought y c as each of these 
terms expresses some condition on which the name fixes 
our thoughts i cannot undei‘stand why they should any 
of them be called the u nconditioned and as they ex 
press very difterent thoughts i cannot understand why 
they should be called by the same name from specu 
lations starting from such a kint i can expect nothing 
but confusion and jhjrplexity nor can i find that any 
thing else has come of them they appear to me more 
barren and more certain to lie bari’en of any results 
which have any plac in our real knowledge than the 
most barren speculations of the schoolmen of the mid 
dle ages which indeed they much resemble in all their 
features — their acuteness their learniug their ambi 
tious aim and their actual failure 

 but leaving the absolute and the uncopdition 
ed as nptionb which cannot be dealt with by our reason 
without £ng something entirely different from their 
defibitiotis we may turn for a moment to another no 
tion which is combined with them by the expositors of 
whom i speak and which has some beailng upon our 
positive science becanse it enters into the reasonings of 
mathematics i mean the notion of infinite soie of 
those who hold that we can know nothing concerning 


 chr w hsauilon koto on oto thisumntva pf rtpfsaammd

the absolute and the ttnconditioned which tibej 
pretend to prove though concerning auch words 
not oonove that anything can be true or ftlse 
also that the infinite is in the same condition 
we can know nothing concerning what is infinite 
therefore i presume nothing concerning infinite spaee 
infinite time infinite number or infinite degrees 

to disprove this doctrine it might be sufficient to 
point out that there is a vast mass of mathematical 
science which includes the notion of infinites aia 
leads to a great body of propositions concerning infi 
nites the whole of the infitesimal calculus depends 
upon conceiving finite magnitudes divided into an in 
finite number of parts these parts are infinitely small 
and of these parts there are other infinitesiinal parts 
infinitely smaller still and so on as far as we please 
to go and even those methods which shun the term 
as newton’s method of ultimate ratios the 
method of indivisibles and the method of exhaustions 
of the ancient geometers do really involve the notion 
of infinite for they imply a process continued without 
limit 

 but perhaps it will be more useful to point out 
the fallacies of the pretended proofs that we can know 
nothing concerning infinity and infinite things 

the argument offered is that of infinity we have no 
notion but the negation of a limit and tliat from 
native notion no positive result can be deduced 

but to this i reply it is not at all true that 
 notion of what is infinite is merely that it is ukojt which 
has no limit we must ask further that that 

space that time that number — and if that spaoe 
that what kind of space that line that surfime 
that ipud space — an if that line that line boiui 
at one that surffioe tkit auia 

bounded on one or on two or on three aides or on 
none however any of these questions are fmawutnd 
we may stui have an infinite space lill ihey are 
answered we can assert nothing about the space not 
because we can assert uothing about infinites but 
because we are net told whi ind of infinite we are 
talking o£ 



patnidsopflt op thb inpinltb 

in reality the definitiozl of an infinite quantity is 
not negative merely but contains a positive part as 
vdl we assume a quantity of a certain kind which 
may be augmented by carrying onward its limits in 
one or more directions this is a finite quantity of a 
given kind we then — when we have thus positively 
determined the kind of the quantity — suppose the 
limit in one or more directions to be annihilated and 
thus we have an infinite quantity but in this infinite 
qaantity there remain the positive properties firom 
which we began as well as the negative property 
the negation of a limit and the positive properties 
joined with the negative property may and do supply 
grounds of reasoning respecting the infinite quantity 

 this is lore so elementary to mathematicians 
that it appears almost puerile to dwell upon it but this 
seems to have been overlooked in the proof that we can 
have no knowledge concerning infinites in such proof 
it is assumed as quite evident that all infinites are 
equal yet as we have seen infinites may differ infi 
nitely among themselves both in quantity and in kind 
a german writer is quoted for an “ingenious” proof 
of this kind in his writings the opponent is supposed 
to urge that a line bag may be made infinite by 
carrying the extremity g infinitely to the rights and 
again infinite by carrying the extremity b infinitely to 
the left and thus the line infinitely extended both 
ways would be double of the line infinite on one side 
only the supposed reply to this is that it cannot 
so because one infinite is equal to another and more 
over that what is bounded at one end ay cannot be 
infinite both which assumptions are without the 
smallest ground that one infinite quantity may be 
double of another is just as dear and certain tis that 
ofie fiiuto quantity may for instancy if one leaf of 
the book which the reader has before him were pro 
duced infinitely upwards it would be an infinite space 
though bounded at the bottom and at both sides if 


 wemnfls stt mr mwomi’s ledure nols 

t 



 pfliwsophy of wsoovert 

the other leaf were in like manner produced infinitely 
upwards it would in like manner be infinite and the 
two together though each infinitei would be double of 
either of them 

 as i have said infinite quantities are conceived 
by conceiving finite quantities increased by the transfer 
of a certain limit and then by nativing this limit 
altogether and thus aninfiuito number is conoeiv 
ed by assuming the series i and so on ug 
to a limit and then removing this limit altogether 
and this shows the baselessness of another argument 
quoted from wereiifele the opponent asks are there 
in the infinite line an infinite number of fbetl then 
in the double line there must bo twice as many and 
thus the former infinite number did not contain ajl the 
possible unities numerus infinitus non omnes habet 
unitates sed prseter eum concipi iosunt totidem um 
tates quibus ille careat eique possunt addi to which 
i reply that the definition of an infinite number is not 
that it contains all possible imities but this — that 
the progress of numeration being begun according to 
a certain law goes on without limit and accordingly 
it is easy to conceive how one infinite number may be 
larger than another infinite number in any proportion 
if for instance we take instead of the progression of 
the natural numbers c and the progression of 
the square numbers i c any term of the 
latter series will be greater than the corresponding term 
of the other series in a ratio constantly increasing and 
the infinite term of the one infinitely greater tbm the 
corresponding infinite term of the other 

 in the some manner we form a conception of in 
finite time ly supposing time to begin now and to go 
on after tw nature of time without limit or by going 
back in thought from the present to a p nnd 
by continuing this retrogression without limit d 
thus we have time infimte a parte emte and ct pmria 
pasty as the phrase used to run and time infinite b 
ways includes both and is the most complete notion of 
eternity 

 perhaps those who thus maintain that we cannot 



philosophy of the infinite 

coneeite anything infinite mean that we cannot form 
to ourselves a definite image of anything infinite and 
this of course is trua we cannot form to ourselves an 
image of anything of which one of the characteristics 
is that it is in a certain way unlimited but this im 
possibility does not prevent our reasoning about infinite 
quantities oombining as elements of our reasoning the 
absence of a limit with othdr positive characters 

 one of the consequences which is drawn by the 
assertors of the doctrine that we cannot know any 
thing about infinity is that we cannot obtain from 
science any knowledge concerning god and i have 
been the more desirous to show the absence of proof of 
this doctrine because i conceive that science doeb give 
us some knowledge though it be very little of the 
nature of god as i shall endeavour to show here 
after 

for instance i conceive that when we say that ood 
is iin etenud being this phiuseology is not empty 
and unmeaning it has been used by the wisest and 
most thoughtfd men in all ages and as conceive 
may be used with undiminished or with increased 
ihopriety after all the light which science and phi 
losophy have thrown upon such declarations the 
reader of newton will recollect how emphatically he 
uses this expression along with others of a cognate 
character god is eternal and infinite that is he 
endures ftom eternity to eternity and is present from 
infinity to infinity he is not eternity and infinity 
but eternal and infinite he is not duration aid space 
but he endures and is present he endures always 
nd is present eveiywhere and by existing always and 
everywhere he constitutes duration and space” we 
dfftll see shortly that the viewto which we ere led may 
be very fitly expressed by this language 

but i will first notice some other aspects of this 
philbeophy 


 sfmiim omtrtdt at tli end of the 



chapter xxvil 


sib william hakiltob on inertia and weight 


i n a preceding chapter i have spoken of sir william 
hfiunilton as the expositor to english readers of 
modem german systems and especially of the socalled 
“philosophy of the unconditioned but the same 
vrriter is also noticeable as a continuator of the specu 
lations of english and scottish philosophers concerning 
primaiy and secondary qualities and these specula 
tions br so far upon the philosophy of science that it 
is proper to notice them here 

i in our survey of the sciences we have spoken of 
a class which we have termed the secondary mechani 
cal sciences these being the sciences which explain 
certain sensible phenomena as sound light and heat 
by means of a medium interposed between external 
bodies and our oigans of sense dn these cases we 
ascribe to bodies certain qualities we call them reso 
nant bright red or green hot or cold but in the 
sciences which relate to these subjects we explain these 
qualities by the figure size and motions of the parts 
of the qieum which intervenes between the oljeot 
and the ear eye or other sensible organ and those 
former qualities sound warmth and colour are called 
ecmdary qualitieb of the bodies while the latter 
figure size and motion are called the primary qwuir 
ties of body 

 this distincuon in its substance is of great an 
tiquity the atomic theory which was set up aa an 
early period of greek philosophy was an attempt to 
account for the seconda qualities of bodies by means 
of their primary qualities and this is really the 
scientific ground of the distinction those are primary 



hamilton on secondahy qualities 

qualities or attributes of body by means of which we 
in a scieutifio view explain and derive their other 
qualities but the explanation of the sensible quali 
ties of bodies by means of their opemtion through a 
medium has till now been very defective and is so 
still we ve to a certain extent theories of sound 
light and heat which reduce these qualities to scales 
and standards and in some measure account mechani 
cally for their differences and gradations but we have 
as yet no similar theory of smells and tastes still 
we do not doubt that fragrance and flavour are per 
ceived by means of an aerial medium in which odours 
float and a fluid medium in which sapid matters are 
dissolved and the special odour and flavour which 
are thus perceived must depend upon the size figure 
motion number c of the particles thus conveyed to 
the organs of taste and smeu that is those secondary 
qualities os well as the others must depend upon the 
primary qualities of the parts of the medium 

 in this way the distinction of primary and second 
ary qualities is definite and precise but when men 
attempt to draw the distinction by guess without any 
scientific principle the separation of the two classes is 
vague and various i have in the history of scientific 
pointed some of the variations which are 
to be found this subject in the writings of jjhilo 
sophers sir william hamilton’ has given an accouijt 
of many more which he has compared and analysed 
with great acuteness he has shown how this distinc 
tion is treated among others by the ancient atomists 
leucippus and democritus by aristotle qalen gar 
lileo descartes boyle malebranche locke beid 
stewarty boyercoll ho then proceeds to give 
his own view which is that we may most properly 
divide the qualities of ladies into thr classes wbidh 
he calls primaryf seemdoprimary and seeonda 
the fonner he enumerates as r extension divisi 
bility size density or barity figure

the secundoprimary qualities sir william haanil 
ton traces in further detail he explains that with 
reference to gravity bodies are heav or lujht with 
reference to cohesion there are many coordinate pairs 
of which he enumerates these — jmrd and aoh firm 
and fiuid — the fluid being subdivided into and 
ain viscid and friable tough and brittle rigid and 
fkxme jiasue and infisaile ductile and inductile retrae 
tile and irretractile rimgh and smooth slippery and 
tenomoufs with reference to repulsion he gives these 
qualities — compresshble and incompressible blastlc and 
ifhelastic and with reference to inertia he mentions 
only moveable and immoveable 

i do not see what advantage is gained to phibsophy 
by such an enumeration of qualities as tui whichy 
alter all does not pretend to completeness nor do x 
see anything either precise or fundamental in such 
distinctions as that of elasticity a mode of cohesiod 
and elasticity a mode of repulsion but a question in 
which our jilosophy is really concerned is how aeix 
any of these ualitis are umversal qualities of matter 
sir w hamilton holds that they are none of them 
necessary qualities of matter and therefore of course 
not univerml and argues this point at some length

matter may either be force producing rest ofhse 
produdng motion if we consider force producing 
motion the motion produced that is the velocity 
jproduced must depend upon the quantity of matter 
moyed it cannot be that the same xower acting in 
the same way shall produce the same velociiy 
pushing a small pebble and n large rock if this were 
so we could have no science on sucli matters it 
must needs be that the same force produces a smaller 
telocity in the larger body and this according to 
some measure of its largeness the measure of the 
degree in which the body thus resists this communica 
tion of motion is inertia and the inertia is neces 
sarily supposed to be proportional to the quantity of 
matter because it is by this inertia that this existence 
and quantity of the matter is measured if therefore 
any soieqbe concerning force and matter is to exist 
matter must have inertia and the inertia must be 
proportional to tho quantity of matter 

 m w hamiltcm in opposition to this says 
that conceive a ldy occupying space and yet 

without attraction or repulsion for another body and 
wholly indifierent to this or that xition in space 
to motion and to rest he infers thence that inertia 
is not a necessary quality of bodies 

to this i reply that even if we can conceive such 
bodies which in fact man living in a world of matter 
cannot conceive at any rate we cannot conceive any 
eeienee about such bodies if bodies were indifferent 
to motion and rest forces could not be measured hf

bodies but from the possibilitj of anj science about 
bodies does it follow that all bies have inertia 

gravity — beasoning of the same kind may be 
employed about weight we can conceive it is urged 
matter without weight but i reply we cannot con 
ceive a science which deals with matter that has no 
weight — a science i mean which deals with the quan 
tity of matter of bodies as atising from the sum of their 
elements for the quantity of matter of bodies is and 
must be measured by those sensible properties of mat 
ter which undergo quantitative addition subtraction 
and division as the matter is added subtracted and 
divided the quantity of matter cannot be known 
in any other way but this mode of measuring the 
quantity of matter in order to be true tit all must be 
universly true if it were only partially true — if 
some kinds of matter had weight and others had not — 
the limits of the mode of measuring matter by weight 
would be arbitrary and therefore e whole procedure 
would be arbitrary and as a mode of obtaining philo 
sophical truth altogether futile but we suppose 
tiuth rcsjecting the composition of bodies to be at 
tainable therefore we must suppose the rule which is 
the necessary basis of such tntth to be itself true 

sir w hamilton has replied te these arguments 
but as conceive without sheeting the force of them 
i will repeat here the answer which i have already 
given and will reprint in the appendix the memoir 
by which his objections were occasioned 

he says i that our reasoning assumes that we 
must necemay have it in our power to ascertain the 
quantity of htter whereas this may be a problem 
out of the reach of human determination 

to this i reply that my reasoning does assume that 
there is a science or sciences whi£ make assertions 
conoeming the quantity of matter mechanics and 
chemistry are such sciences my assertion is that tx 
make such sdenoes possihle quantity of matter must

proportional to weight if my opponent deny that 
meohanios and chemistry can exist as science he may 
invalidate my proof but not otherwise 

 he says that there are two conceivable ways of 
estimating the quantity of matter by the space occu 
pied and by the weight or inertia and that i assume 
the second measure gratuitously 

to which i reply that the most elementary steps in 
mechanics and in chemistry contradict the notion that 
he quantity of matter is proportionate to the space 
they proceed necessarily on a distinction between 
spe and matter — between mere extension and ma 
terial substance 

 he allows that wc cannot make the extension of 
a body the measure of the quantity of matter because 
he says we do not know if ‘‘the compressing force” is 
such as to produce “ the closest compression” that is 
he assumes a compressing force assumes a “closest com 
pression” assumes a peculiar and very improbable 
atomic hypothesis and all this to supply a reason why 
we are not to believe the first simple principle of 
mechanics and chemistry 

 he speaks of “a scries of apparent fluids aslight 
or its vehicle the caloriflo the electrogalvanic and 
magnetic agents vdiich we can neither denude of their 
character of substance nor clothe with the attribute of 
weight” 

to which my reply is that premsely because i cannot 

clothe” these agents with the attribute of weight i 
do “ denude them of the character of substance” they 
are not substances but agencies these imponderable 
agents are not properly called “ imponderable fluida 
this i conceive that i have proved and the proof is 
net baken by denying the conclusion without showing 
angr defect in the reasoning

and about “a criterion of truth subjectively necessary

influence of gekman systems of philosophy in 
britain 


t he philosophy of kant as i have already said 
involved a definite doctrine on the subject of the 
fundamental antithesis and a correction of some of the 
errors of locke and his successors it was not however 
at first favourably received among british philosophers 
and those who accepted it wore judged somewhat ca 
priciously and captiously i will say a word on those 
points 

i stewart — dugald stewart in his dissertatim 
on the progress of the moral sciences repeatedly men

our own times kant and his followers seem to have 
thought that they had thrown a strong light on the 
nature of space and also of time when they introduced 
the word form form of the intellect as a common 
term applicable to both is not this to revert to the 
scholastic folly of verbal generalization” and in 
part il ho gives a long and laborious criticism of a 
portion of kant’s spections of which the spirit 
may be collected from his describing them as resulting 
in ‘‘the metaphysical commdrum that the human mind 
considered as a nommon and not as a pherwmenar 
neither exists in sp nor time” and after mention

 i am ashamed to say that in great britain the only 
one of these names which has been much talked of 
is kant” and again in note ee he translates some 
portion of the german pliilosopher adding that to the 
expressions so employed he can attach no meaning 

htewart in his criticism of kant’s doctrines re 
marks that in asserting tlmt the human mind pos 
sesses in its own ideas aa element of necessaiy and 
universal tnith not derived from experience kant had 
hbeen anticipated by price by cudwiith and even by 
plato to whose tfiaatetus botli price and cudworth 
refer as containing views similar to their own and 
undoubtedly this doctrine of ideas as indispensable 
sources of necessary truths was promulgated and sup 
ported by weighty arguments in tlie tkeotetua and 
has ever since been held by many philosophers in 
opposition to tle contmiy doctrine also extensively 
hold that all truth is derived from cxerieuce but 
in pointing out this circumstance as diminishing the 
importance of kant’s speculations stewart did not 
sufficiently consider that doctrines fundamentally the 
same may discliargc a very different office at different 
periods of the history of philosophy plato’s dia 
logues did not destroy nor even diminish the value of 
cudwortli’s “immutable morality” notwithstanding 
cudworth’s publications prices doctrines came out a 
little afterwards with the air and with the effect of 
novelties cudworth’s assertion of ideas did not pre 
vent the rise of hume’s skepticism and it wiis hume’s 
skepticism which gave occasion to kant’s new assertion 
of necessaiy and universal truth and to his examina 
tion into the grounds of the possibility and reality of 
auoh truth to maintain sucli doctrine after the appear 
ance of intermediate speculations and with reference 
to them was very different fixim maintaining it before 
and this is the merit which kant’s admirers claim for 
him nor can it bo denied that his writings produced 
au immense effect upon the mode of treating such 
questious in germany and have had even in this 
country an influence far beyond what mr stewart 
would have deemed their due

a mr h lewea — but as injustice has thus 
been done to kant by confounding his case with that of 
his predecessors of like opinions so on the other hand 
injustice has also been done both to him and those 
who have followed him in the assertion of ideas by 
confounding thdr case with his this injustice seems 
to me to be committed by a writer on the history of 
philosophy who has givenn account of the successive 
schools of philosophy up to our own time — has as 
signed to kant an important and prominent place 
in the recent history of metaphysics — but has still 
maintained that kant’s philosophy and indeed eveiy 
philosophy is and must be a failure in order to 
prove is thesis the author naturally has to examine 
kant’s doctrines and the reasons assigned for them 
and to point out what he conceives to be the fallacy of 
these arguments this accordingly he professes to do 
but as soon as he has entered uixn the argument he 
substitutes as his opponent for the philosopher of 
kbnigsberg a writer of our own time and country 
who does not profess himself a kantian who has been 
repeatedly accused with whatever justice of misrepre 
senting what he has borrowed from kant and whose 
main views are in the opinion of the writer himself

he intends to consider says now to the ques

writer whose views he has to criticize without stating 
how he connects him with kant and goes on aiguing

manadi haa stated tinctljr some of tbe pcduts in 
wbioh ha ooncelves timt i hare erred in deriating 
from the doctrines of kant should wish to make a 
few remarks on those points 

 kant considers that space and time arc con 
ditions of perception and hence sources of necessary 
and universal truth dr whewell agrees with kant 
in placing in the minl certain sources of necessary 
truth he culls these fundamental ideas and ieckons 
besides space and time others as cause likeness 
substance and several more mr mill the most 
recent and able expounder of tlio opposite doctrine 
derives all truths from observation and denies that 
there is such a separate source of truth as ideas mr 
hansel does not agree either with mr mill or dr 
wliewell he adheres to the original kantian thesis 
that space and time are sources of necessary truths 
but denies the office to the other fundamental ideas 
of dr whewell in reading what has been said by 
mr mill mr mansel and other critics on the subject 
of what i have called fundamental ideasy i am led to 
perceive that i lave expressed myself incautiously 
with regard to the identity of character between the 
first two of these fundamental ideas namely space 
and tim and the othcib as forep composition and 
the liker and am desirous of explaining to those 
who take an interest in these speculations how far i 
claim for the other fundamental ideas the samd cha 
racter and attributes as fur space and time 

 the special and characteiistic property of all 
the fundamental ideas is what i have already men 
tioned that they are the mental sources of necessary 
and universal scientific truths call them ideae 
as being something not derived from sensation but 
governing sensation and consequently giving form to 
our experience — fwadamemldlf as being the founda 
tion of knowledge or at least of science and the 
way in which those ideas become the foundations of 
science is that when they are clearly and distinctly 
entertained in the mind they give rise to inevitabhai 
convictiens orintuitiois which may be expressed as 



mvr axioms possible f 

aichm an these axioms are the foundatims ot 
sciences respective uf each idea the idea of space 
rhen clearly possessed gives rise to geometrical ax 
ioms and is thus the foundation of the science of geo 
metry the idea of mechanical force a modification 
of the idea of cause when clearly developed in the 
mind gives birth to axioms which are the foundation 
of the science of mechanic the idea of substance 
gives rise to the axiom which is univoroally accepted 
that wo cannot by any process for instance by 
chemical jrocosses create or destroy matter but can 
only oombiue and searate elements — and thus gives 
rise to the science ol chemistry 

 now it may be observed that in giving this 
account of the foundation of science i lay stress on 
the condition ihat the ideas must be clmrly and dis 
tiactly oseed the idea of space must be quite 
clear in the mind or else the axioms of geometry 
will not be been to be true there will he no huuuioi 
of their truth and for a mind in such a state there 
can bo no science of geometry a man may have a 
confused and perplexed or a vicant and inert state of 
mind in which it is not clearly apparent to him that 
two straight lines cannot inclose a space but this is 
not a frequent case the idea of space is much more 
commonly clear in the minds of men than tiss other 
ideas on which science depends as force or sub 
stance it is much more common to find minds in 
which these latter ideas are not so clear and distinct 
as to maho the axioms of mechanics or of chemistry 
selfevident indeed the examples of a state ot mind 
in which the ideas of force or of substance are so 
clear as to be made the basis of science are compara 
tively few they are the examples of minds scienti 
fically cultivated at least to some extent hence 
though the axioms of mechanics or of chemistry may 
bo in their own nature as evident as those of geo 
metry they are not evident to so many persons nor 
at so early a period of intellectual or scientific culture 
and this being the case it is not surprising that some 
pnons should oubt whether these axiosis are evident

at all — should think that it is an error io assoit 
that there exist in sach sciences as mechanics or 
chemistry fundamental ideas fit to be classed with 
space as being like it the origin of axioms 

in speaking of all the fundamental ideas as being 
alike the source of axioms when clearly possessed 
without dwelling sufficiently upon the amount of 
mental discilmc which i requisite to give the mind 
this clear possession of most of them and in not 
keeping before the reader the different degrees of evi 
dence which in most minds the axioms of different 
sciences natimilly have i have as i have said given 
occasion to my readers to misunderstand me i will 
point out one or two passages which show that this 
misunderstanding has occurred and will try to re 
move it 

 the character of axiomatic truths seen by in 
tuition is that they are not only seen to be true but 
to be necessary — that the contrary of them is not 
only false but inconceivable but tliis inconceivablc 
ness deiends entirely upon the clearness of tie ideas 
which the axionis involve so long as those ideas 
are vague and indistinct the contrary of an axiom 
may be assented to though it cannot be distinctly 
conceived it may be assented to not because it is 
possible but because we do not see clearly what w 
possible to a person who is only beginning to think 
geometrically there may appear notiiing absuid in the 
assertion that two straight lines may inclose a space 
and in the same manner to a person who is only 
beginning to think of mechanical tinths it may not 
appear to be absurd that in mechanical processes re 
action shotild be greater or less than action and so 
again to a person who has not thought steadily about 
substance it may not appear inconceivable that by 
chemical operatious we should generate new matter 
or destroy matter which already exists 

here then we have a difficulty — the test of axiemis 
is that the eontraiy of them is inconceivable and yet 
perna till they have in some measure studied the 
subject do not see this inccmceivableneika hence our 



axioms poibliu 


 

axioms must be evident only to a small number of 
thinkers and seem not to deserve the name of self 
evident or necessary truths 

this difficulty has been strongly urged by afr mill 
as supporting his view that all knowledge of truth 
is derived from experience and in order that the 
opposite doctrine which i have advocated may not 
labour under any disadvantages which really do not 
belong to it i must explain that do not by any 
neans assert that those truths which i regard as 
necessary are all equally evident to common thinkers 
or evident to persons in all stages of intellectual deve 
lopment i may even say that some of those truths 
which i regard as necessary and the necessity of which 
i believe the human mind to be capable of seedng by 
due preparation and thought are still siich ‘that this 
amount of preiamtion and thought is rare and pecu 
liar and i will willingly grant that to attain to and 
reservo siioli a clearness and siibtlety of mind as this 
intuition requires is a task of no ordinaiy difficulty 
and labour 

 this doctrine — that some truths may be seen 
by intuition but yet that the intuition of them may 
be a rare and difficult attainment — t have not it 
would seem conveyed with sufficient clearness to ob 
viate misapprehension mr mill has noticed a pas 
sage of my philosophy on this subject which he has 
understood in a sense different om that which in 
tended speaking of the two principles of chemical 
science — that combinations are definite in kind and 
in quantity — had tried to elevate myself to the 
point of view in which these principles are seen not 
only to be time but to be necessary i was aware 
thai even the profoundest chemists had not ventured 
to do this yet it appeared to me that there were con 
siderations which seemed to show that any other role 
would imply that the world was a world on which the 
human mind could not employ itself in scientific spe 
oulalion at all these considerations i ventured to 
put jbr wards not as views which could at present be 
generally accepted but as views to wm chemical 



 philosophy of discovery 

philosophy appeared to me to tend mr mill not 
unnaturally i must admit supposed me to mean that 
the two principles of chemistry just stated aie selfr 
evident in the same way and in the same degree as 
the axioms of geometry are so i afterwards ex 
plained that what meant to do was to throw out an 
opinion that if we could conceive the composition of 
bodies distinctly we might be able to see that it is 
necessary that the modes of this composition sliould 
be definite this mr mill does not object to® buc 
he calls it a great attenuation of my former opinion 
which he understood to be that we that is men in 
general already sec or may see or ought to see this 
necessity such a general aipreheiision of the neces 
sity of definite chemical composition i certainly never 
reckoned upon and even in my own mind the 
thought of such a necessity was rather an anticipation 
of what the intuitions of philosophical chemists iu 
another generation would be than an assertion of what 
they now are or ought to be much less did i expect 
that persons neither chemists nor philosophera would 
already or perhaps ever see tliat a proposition so 
recently disooveied to be true is not only tnio bub 
necessary 

lo of the bearing of this vie on the question at 
issue between mr mill and me i may hereafter speak 
hut i will now notice other persons who have mis 
understood me in the same way 

an tble writer in the edinburgh review has in 
like mner said dr whewell seems to us to have 
gone much too far in reducing to necessary truths 
what assuredly the generality of mankind will not feel 
to be so” it is a fact wlu i do not at all contest 
hat the gemreduy of mankind will not feeltlie axion 
of chemistry or even of mechanics to be necesa 
truths but i had said not that the generalify of 
mannd would feel this necessity but in a passage 
just befoie quoted by the beviewer that the mind

iiiidler certain circumstances auains a point of vieio 
from which it can pronounce mechanil and other 
fundamental truths to be necessaiy in their nature 
though disclosed to us by experience and observation 

both the edinburgh reviewer and mx mansel ap 
pear to hold a distinction between the fundamented 
truths of geometry and tliose of the other subjects 
which i have classed with them the latter says 
jhat perhajis metaphysicians may hereafter establish 
the existence of other subjective conditions of intui 
tions or as i should call them fundamental ideas 
besides space and time but that in asserting such to 
exist in the science of mechanics i certainly go too 
far and he gives as an instance my essay — “ demon 
stration that all matter is heay” i certainly did 
not expect that the principles asserted in that essay 
would be assented to as readily or as generally as the 
axioms of geometry but i conceive that i have 
there proved that cliemical science using the balance 
as one of its implements cannot admit imponderable 
bodies” among its elements this impossibility will 
i think not only be found to exist in fact but seen 
to exist necessarily by chemists in proportion as 
they advance towards general propositions of chemical 
science in which the socalled “imponderable fluids” 
enter but even if i be right in this opinion to how 
few will this necessity be made apparent and how 
slowly will the intuition spread i am as well aware 
as my critics that the necessity will probably never be 
apparent to ordinary thinkers • 

ii though mr mansel does not acknowledge any 
subjective conditions of intuition besides space and 
time he does recognize other kinds of necessity which 
i should equally refer fundamental ideas because 
they are no less than space and time the foundations 
of universal and necessary truths in science such 
are the principle of substance — all qualities exist 
in some subject and the principle of oausalilyjnr

every event hit its cause to these principles he 
ascribes a ‘metaphysical neoessi’ the nature and 

 rounds of which he analyses with great acuteness 

at what i hare to observe is that whatever differ 
enees may bo pointed out between ie grounds of the 
necessity in this case of tnetaphyhical necessity and in 
that which mr mansel calls nuuhemcuical ncoeadty 
which belongs to the conditions or ideas of space 
and of titne still it is not the less true that tfa 
ideas of subnce and of cause do afford a fbund 
tion for necessary tniths and tliat on these truths aio 
built sciences that every cliange must have a cuuse 
with the corresponding axioms — tliat the cause is 
known by tho effect and measured by it — is the 
basis of the science of meclianics that there is a 
substance to which qualities belong with the corre 
sponding axiom — that wo cannot create or destroy 
substance though we may alter qualities by combin 
ing and separating substances — is the basis of tho 
science of chemistry and that this doctrine of the 
indestictibility of substance is a primary axiomatic 
truth is certain j both becausq it has been universally 
taken for granted by men seeking for general tniths 
and because it is not and cannot be proved by expe 
rience® so that i have here evtn according to mr 
mansefs own statement other grounds besides space 
and time for necessary truths in science 

 besides mathematical and metaphrsical necessity 
mr mansel recognizes also a logical necesst will 
not pretend to say that this kind of neqebsity is ex 
actly represented hy any of those fundament ideas 
which are the basis of science but yet i think it will 
be found that this logical necessity mainly operates 
through the attribution of karnes to thin and that 
a large portion of its cogency arises fbom these maxims 
— that names must be so imposed that qeneralfro

 besides the different kinds of necessity which 
mr manscl thus acknowledges i do not see why he

indeed he appears to me to do he acknowledges i 
think the distinction of primary and secondary quali

objections considered 


t he doctrine that iigcessary truth is progressive 
is a doctrine very impohant in its bearing upon 
the nature of the human mind arid as i conceive in 
its theological bearing also but it is a doctrine to 
which objections are likely to be made from various 
quarters and will consider some of these objections 

j necessary tinitlis it will bo said cannot in 
crease in numlr new ones cinnot be added to the 
old ones for necessaiy trutljis ai’e those of which the 
necessity is plain and eviderit to all mankind — to the 
common sense of man atich as the axioms of geo 
metry but that which is evident to all mankind 
must bo evident from the ilrst that which is plain to 
the common sense of iriaii cannot require scientific dis 
covery that which is nocessaidly true cannot require 
accumulated proo 

tfo this that necessary truths require for 

their apprehension a certain growth and development 
of the httmau mind though it is seen that they are 
necessarily true tliis is seen duly by riiosc who think 
steadily and clearly and to think steadily and clearly 
on any kind of subject requires time and attention — 
requircis mental culture this may be seen even in 
the case of the axioms of geometry these axioms 
are selfevident but to whoin are they selfevident 
not to uncultured savages or young children or per 
sons of loose vague lbits of thought to see the 
truth and necessity of geometrical kxioms we need 
geometrical culture 

therefore that any axioms are not evider witiaut 
patient thought and continued study of the subject 
does not disprove their necessity rrinoiples may be 



 philosophy op discovert 

axiomatic and necessaiy althongh they require time 
and the progicss of thought and of knowledge to bring 
them to light and axioms may be thus gradually 
brought to light by the progress of knowledge 

nor is it difficult to give examples of such axioms 
other than geometrical there is an axiom wffiich has 
obtained currency among thoughtful men from the 
time that imin began to speculate about himself and 
the universe — e niliih nil fit nothing can be made 
of nothing no material substance can be produced 
or destroyed by natural causes though its form and 
consistence may be changed indefinitely is not this 
an axiom a necessary truth yet it is not evident 
to all men at fiist and without mental culture at 
first and before habits of steady and consistent thought 
are formed men think familiarly of tlio creation and 
destruction of matter only when the mind has 
received some pliilosophical culture does it sec the 
truth and necessity of tlxe axiom of substance and tlmh 
it does see it 

and the axioms on which the science of mechanics 
rests that the cause is measured by the effects that 
reaction is equal and opposite to action and the like— 
are not these evident to a mind cultivated by steady 
thought on such subjects and do they not require 
such culture of the mind in order to see them are 
they not obscure or uncertain to those who are not so 
cultured that is to common thinkers to the general 
bulk of mankind thus then it requires the discipline 
of the science of mechanics to enable the mind to see 
the axioms of that srience 

and does not this go further as science and the 
careful study of the grounds of science go further to 
a person well disciplined in mechanical reasoning it 
has become not a conclusion but a principle that in 
mechanical action what is gained in power is lost in 
time or that in any change the force gained is equal 
to the force lost so that new force cannot be generated 
any more than new matter by natural changes is this 
an axiom a necessary fundamental truth it appears 
eo at least one great thinker and discoverer no

alive among us if itdo not appear so to us or not 
in the same sense may not thm be because we have 
not yet reached his point of view may not the con 
viction which is now his alone become hereafter the 
conviction of the philosophical world and whatever 
the case may be in this instance have there not been 
examples of this progress did not galileo and the 
disciples of galileo reduce several mechanical prin‘ 
ciplcs to the character of necesstiry truths after they 
had by experiment and reasoning discovered them to 
be actually true and have we not in these cases so 
many proofs that necesiy truth is progressive along 
with the progiess of knowledge 

 but it will be said the necessary character 
claimed for such truths is an illusion the pro 
positions so brought into view are really established 
by observation by the study of external facts and 
it is only the edect of habit and familiarity which 
makes ihen of science when they well know them 
to be true think them to be necessarily true they 
are really the results of experience as their history 
shows and therefore cannot be necessaiy and d rioh 
truths 

to which i reply such principles as i have men 
tioned — that miial substance cannot be produced 
ox destroyed — that the cause is measured by the effect 
—that reaction is equal and opposite to action aro 
not the results of experience nor can be no experi 
ence can prove them they are necessarily aumed as 
the interpretation of cxieiience they were not proved 
in the course of scientiiic investigations but brought 
to light as such investigations shewed their necessity 
they are not the results but the conditions of experi 
mental sciences if the axiom of substance wero iot 
true and wore not assumed we could not have such a 
boiexice as chemistry that is we could have no know 
ledge at al l respecting the changes of ibrm of sujxatances 
xf the axioms of mechanics were not line and wore 
assumed we coxdd have no science pf mechanics 
ihai is no owledge of the laws of force ou 

jitter it is not any special of ihe sewpe 



 


philosophy op ditebt 


ia sacl cases bnt the existfkce the possibuityy of 
any science which establishes the necessity of these 
axioms tliey are not the consequences of knowledge 
acquired from without but the internal condition of 
our being able to know and when we are to know 
concerning any new subject contained in the universe 
it is not inconceivable nor strange that there should 
be new conditions of our knowledge 

it is not inconceivable or strange therefore that as 
new sciences are formed new axioms the foundations 
of such sciences should come into view as the light 
of clear and definite knowledge is kindled in suc 
cessive chambers of the universe it may disclose not 
only the aspect of tliose new apartments but also 
the form and structuie of tlie lamp which man is thus 
allowed to carry from point to point and to transmit 
from hand to hand and though the space illumined 
to man’s vision may always bc small in comparison 
with the immeasumble abyss of darkness by which it 
is surrounded and though the light may be dim and 
feeble as well as partial this need not make uu doubt 
that so far as we can by the aid of this lamp we see 
truly so r as wo discern the necessary laws of the 
universe the laws are true and their truth is rooted 
in that in which the being of the u verse is rooted 

and to dwell for a moment longer on this image 
we may also conceive that all that this lamp— the 
intellect of man cidtivated by science — does by the 
light wudi it gives is this — that it pels a dark 
ness which is dark for man alone and discloses to 
him somb things in some measure as all things lie in 
clear and perfect light before the eye of god to 
the divine mind au the laws of the universe are 
plain luid clear in all their multiplicity extent and 
depth the human mind is capable of seeing some 
of these laws though only a few to some extent 
though but alittle way to some depth though never to 
the wttom but the human mind can in the course 
of ages and generations by the long exerdse of thougi 
successfully employed in augmenting knowlddgei im 
prove its powers of vision and may thus come to see 



keoessaky htuth is pbogressive i 

more laws tlian at first to trace their extent more 
laigely to understand them more thoroughly md 
thus the inward intellectual light of man may bome 
broader and broader from age to age though ever 
naitow when compared with completeness 

 is it strange to any one that inward light as 
well as outward knowlce should thus increase in 
the course of man’s earthly care that as knowledge 
extends the foundations of knowledge should expand 
that as man goes on discovering new truths he should 
also discover something coucemiug the conditions of 
truth is it wonderful that as science is progressive 
the philosophy of science also should be prggiessive 
that as we know more of everything else we should 
also come to know moi’e of our powers of knowing 

this does not seem tc have been supposed by philo 
sophers in general or rather they have assumed that 
they could come to know more about the powers of 
knowing by thinking about them even without taking 
into account the light thrown upon the nature of 
knctwledgc by the progress of knowledge prom plato 
downwards through aristotle through the schoolmen 
to descartes to locke to kant sohelliiig and kegel 
philosophers have been perpetually endeavouring to 
explore the nature the fonudations the consequences 
of our knowlge but since plato scarcely one of 
them has ever pioceeded as if new light were thrown 
upon knowledge by new knowledge they have 
many or m of them attempted to establhfh funda 
mental tmths some of them new fundamental truths 
about the human mind and the nature aim conditions 
of its knowledge these attempts show that they tio 
not deny or doubt that there may bo such new fiin 
damental truths such new fundamental truths re 
specting the human mind and respecting kndwledge 
must in many cases at least as it wju be seen 
that they are on examining tho systems proposed 
hy the philosophers just motioned seen by their own 
light to be true they are new cmme in philosophy 
these philoscmhera therefor or their disciples cannot 
consistently blame us for holding the possibility of 
new axioms being introdoeed into philosophy from age

to age as there arise philosophers more and more 
clearsighted 

 but thoitgh the have uo ground fpr rejecting 
tmr new axioms merely because th are new we may 
have good ground for doubting the value of their new 
axioms that is of the foundations of their systems 
becattsc they are new truths about imowledgo gathered 
by merely exploring the old fiflda of knowledge we 
found our hopes of obtaining a larger view of the 
constitution of the human mind than the early philo 
sophers had on this — that we obtain our view by 
studying the operation of the human mind eince their 
time its progress in acquiring a large stock of uucou 
tesied truths and in obtaming a wide and real know 
ledge of the universe here are new materials which 
the ancients had not and which may therefore justify 
the hope that wo may build our philosophy higher than 
the ancients did but mudom philosoihers who use 
only the same materials as the ancient philosophers 
usi have not the same grounds for hope which wo 
have if they borrow all their examples and illustra 
tions of man’s knowledge of the universe from the con 
dition of the univere as existing in space and time 
that is from the geometrical condition of the universe 
they may fail to obtain the light which might be 
obtained if they considered that the bnivcrso is also 
subject to conditions of substance of cause and effect 
of force and matter is filled with kinds of things 
in whose stincture we assume design and ends and 
so on and if they reflected that these conditions or 
ideas are laot mere vague notions but the bases of 
sciences which all thoughtfiil persons allow to be cer 
tain and real 

it is then as i have said firom taking advinte of 
th progressive character which physical science m the 
history of man has been found to possess that i hope 
to learn more of the wture and prospects of the hu 
man mind and soul than those cap learn who still take 
tbr stand on the old limited grqund of man’s know 
ledge the knowledge of geometry by the greeks 
was the stamngpoint of their sound philosophy ijb

thus refuted the skepticism whioh yraa destroying plu 
losopby and offered specimens of solid truth for the 
philosopher to analyse but the greeks tried to go 
beyond geometry in their knowledge of the universe 
they tried to construct a science of astronomy— of 
harmonics — of optics — of mechanics in the two 
former subject they sudbeeded to a vejy considerable 
extent the question then aioso what was the pbilo 
sophical import of these new sciences what light did 
they throw on the nature of the universe on the nature 
of knowledge on the nature of the human mind these 
questions plato attempted to answer he said that 
the lesson of these now sciences is this— that the 
universe is framed upon the divine idem that man 
cau to a certain extent obtain sight of these ideas and 
that when he docs this ho knows concerning the uni 
vcise and again he also put the matter otherwise 
there is an intelligible worlds of which the visible and 
sensible world is only a dim image science consists 
in understanding the intelligible world which man is 
to a certain extent able to do by the nature of his 
understanding this was plato’s philosophy founded 
upon the progress which human imowledge had made 
up to his time since his time knowledge that is 
science has made a large additional progress what 
is the philosophical lesson to be derived from this pro 
gress and from the new provinces thus added to 
human knowledge this is a question which i have 
tried to answer i am not aware that anjr one since 
plato has taken this line of speculation — i mean hiui 
tried to spell out the lesson of philosophy which is 
taught us not by one specimen or a few only of the 
knowledge respeiug the universe whidi man has 
acquired but by including in bis survey all the pro 
vinces of human knowledge and the whole historyof 
each at any rate whatever any one else may imve 
done in this way it seems to me that new uffernces 
remain to be drawn of the nature of those whjkh pteto 
drew and those i here attempt to deduce and to 
illustrate

disco viiy 


r tat necessary truth is progressiyc — lliat science 
is the idialiation of facts and that this process 
goes on from age to ago and advances with tlio ad 
vance of sci‘ntiiic dicovory — those are dootiinos 
which i have endeavoured to establish and to eluci 
date if these doctrines are true they aie so import 
ant tliat i may be excused should rotiuu to them again 
and again and trace their consequences in various di 
rections especially i would examine the bearing of 
those doctrines upon our religious philosophy i have 
liithcido abstained in a groat moasuie fiom discussing 
religious doctrines but such a reserve carried too far 
must deprive our philosophy of all coniplotencss no 
philosophy of science can be compltc which is nut 
also a philosophy of the univeise and no philosophy 
of the universe can satisfy thoughtful men liich does 
not include a reference to the power by wjiich the uni 
verse came to be what it is su posiiig then such a 
irenoe to le admitted let us sec wliat aspect our 
doctrines ftive to it 

 foio cam tjuere he necesary tmijis coneeniing 
ikfp actual universe — in looking at the bearing of our 
doctrine oh the philosophy of the universe we are met 
by a difficulty which is indeed only a fonuer difficulty 
under a hisw aspect when wo are come to the con 
cludon that science consists of facts idealized we are 
led to ask hbw this can be how can facts be ideal 
ow can that which is a ffict of external obsor 
become a result of internal thought £ow can 
 that which was known a posteriori become known a 



its theological beabing 


 


priori how can the world of thiiigs be identified 
with the world of thoughts how can we discover a 
necessriry connexion among more phenomena 

or to put the matter otherwise how i it tlmt the 
deductions of the intellect are verified in the world of 
sense how is it that the tnitlis of science obtained 
d priori are exemplified in the general rules of facta 
observed h poiteriori how is it that facts in science 

 always do correspond to our ideas 

j have propounded this paradox in various forms 
because i wish it to be seen that it is at first sights a 
real not merely a crbal contradict ion or at least a 
difficulty if we can discover the solutuui of this dif 
ficulty in any one form robally we can transpose 
the answer so as to suit the other forms of tho 
question 

 fiuppoe the case to be as i have stated it that in 
 some sciences at least laws which were at first facts of 
observation came to be seen as necessary truths and 
let us see to what this amounts in the several sciences 

it amounts to this the truths of oeoinctiy such as 
wo discern them by the exercise of our own thoughts 
are always verified in tlie world of observation tie 
laws of fmaco derived from our ideas lue universally 
tiue in the external world 

in tho same way as to number the laws or tiaiths 
respecting number which are deduced from our idea of 
number are universally true in the external world 

in the same way as to the science which deals 
with matter and force the tniths of wliiijji liavo 
spoken as derived from ideas — that action equal to 
i’eaction and that causes arc measured by tbeir offert 
— are universally verified in all tho laws of phenomenia 
of the external world which are disclosed by the 
science of mechanics 

in the same way with regard to the compositionand 
resolution of bodies into their elements the tiutlie 
derived from our idea of matter — that no compositjm 
or resolution can increase or diminish the quantity of 
matter in the world and that the propcriiw of com 
pounds are determined by their composition — are 

aa 



 philosophy op discovery 

truths derived from ideas of quantity of matter and 
compasition and iesolution but these truths are uni 
versally verified when we come to the iaots of che 
mistiy 

in the same way it is a truth flowing from the ideas 
of the kinds of things as the sible subject of gioral 
iropositiods expressed in language that the kinds of 
things must be definite and this law is veiified when 
ever we express general projmitions in general terms 
for instance when we distinguish species in mine 
ralogy 

 this last example irnty apear to most readers 
doubtful i have purposely iurbued the enumeration 
till i came to a doubtful example because it is and i 
conceive always will be impossible to extend this gene 
ral view to all the sciences on the eontiaiy this doc 
trine applies at present to only a very few of the sci 
ences even in the eyes of those who hold the existence 
of ideal truths the doctrine extends at present to a 
few only of the sciences even if it extend to one or 
two besides those which have been mentioned — gco 
metiy mechaiiies chemistry mineralogy and though 
it may hereafter appear tjiat ideal truths are possible 
and attainable for a few other sciences yet the laws 
disclosed by sciences which caimotl e reduced to ideal 
elements will j conceive always veiy far outnumber 
those which can be so reduced the great body of our 
scientific knowledge will always be knowledge obtained 
by mere observation not knowledge obtained by the 
use of theories alone 

 the survey of the history and philosophy of the 
sciences which we have attcmjited in previous works 
enabled us to ofier a sort of estimate of the relative 
portions of science which have and which have not 
thus been idealized for the aphorisms which we 
have collected from that survey conhiin axioms which 
may be iregaided as the ideal portions of tlie various 
sciences and the inspection of that series of aphorisms 
wifi show us to how such a portion of scieuco any

its theological bearing 


 


thing of this axiomatic or ideal character can be ap 
plied these axioms are the axioms of geometry 
aphorism xxvt of arithmetic xxxvi of 
causation xlvil of a medium for the sensation of 
secondary qualities lviii and their measure ixix 
of polarity lxxii of chemical affinity lxxvi 
of substance lxxvil of atoms lxxjx 

have we any axioms in the sciences which succeed 
these in our survey as botany zoology biology pa 
iteontologyl 

there is the axiom of symmetry lxxx of kind 
already in some measure spoken of lxxxiii of 
pinal cause cv of first cause cxvi 

 small extend necessary trvijt — it is easily 
seen how small apportion of each of these latter sciences 
is included in these axioms while with regard to the 
sciences first mentioned the axioms include in a man 
ner the whole of the science the science is only 
the consequence of the axioma the whole science of 
mechanics is only the development of the axioms con 
cerning action and reaction and concerning cause and 
its measures which i have mentioned as a part of our 
ideal knowledge • 

in fact beginning from geometry and arithmetic 
and going througlidtfie sciences of mechanics of second 
ary qualities and of chemistry onwards to the sci 
ences which deal with organized beings we find that 
our ideal truths occupy a smaller and smaller share of 
the sciences in succession and that the vast variety of 
facts and phenomena which nature offers to is less 
and less subject to any rules or principles which we 
can perceive to be necessary 

but still that there are principles — necessary princi 
jdes which prevail universally even in these higher 
parts of the natural sciences — appears on a careful cqn 
sideration of the axioms wmch i have mentioned — that 
in symmetrical natural bodies the similar parts arq 
similarly affected — that every event must have a cause 
— that there must be a first cause and the uke 

d it being established then that in the progress 
of fidence facts are idealized — that d posufiiyn truths 



 philosophy op discovery 

become a pricni truths — that the world of things is 
identified with the world of thoughts to a certain ex 
tent — to an extent which grows larger as we see into 
the world of things more clearly the question recurs 
wliich i liave alreiidy asked how ciin this be 

how can it be that tbe world without us is thus in 
some respects identical with the world within us — 
that is our question 

 how did things come to be is they are — it 
woull seem that we may make a step in the solution 
of this question if we can answer this other how 
did the world without us and the world within us come 
to be what they are 

to this question two very different answers are re 
turned by tliose wlio do and those who do not believe 
in a supreme mind or intelligence as the cause and 
foundation of the world 

those who do not believe that the world has for its 
cause and foundation a supreme intelligence or who 
do not connect their philosophy with this belief would 
reply to our inquiry tlmt the reason why man’s 
thoughts aud ideas agree with the world is that they 
are borrowed from thh world and that the pemuasion 
tliat these ideas and truths derived from them have 
any origin except the world without us is an il 
lusion 

on this view i shall not now dwell for i wish to 
trace out the consotpiences of the opposite view that 
there exists a supreme mind which is the cause and 
foundation of the univei’se those who hold this and 
who also hold that the human mind can become poa 
seased of necessary truths if they are asked how it is 
that these necessary truths aro universally verified in 
the material world will reply that it is so because the 
supreme oicativemind has made it so to be — that the 
truths which exist or can be generated in man’s mind 
agree with the laws of the universe because ho who 
hsa made and sustains man and the universe has 
caused them to agree — that our ideas correspond to 
the facts of the world and the facts to our ideas 
because our ideas are given us by the same power 



its theologioal bearing 

which made the world and given so that these can 
and must agree with the world so mada 

 view of the theiet — this in its genera form 
would be the answer of the theiaty so we may call 
him who believes in a supreme intelligent cause of 
the world and of man to the questions which we 
have propounded — the perplexity or paradox which 
we have tried to bring iifto view but wo must en 
deavour to trace this view — thiss answer — more into 
detail 

if a supreme intelligence be the cause of the world 
and of the laws which prevail among its phenomena 
these laws must exist as acts of that intelligence — 
as laws caused by the thoughts of the supreme mind 
—as ideas in the mind of god and then the ques 
tion would be how wo are to conceive these thought 
these ideas to be at tlie same time divine and human 
— to be at the same time ideas in the dirine mind 
and necessary truths in the human mind and this is 
the question which i would now inquire into 

 is this flatonmn — to the terms in which the 
inquiiy is now propounded it may be objected that i 
am taking for granted the platonic doctrine that the 
world is constituted according to the ideas of the 
divine mind jjjj may be said that this doctrine is 
connected with gross extravagancies of speculation 
and fiction and has long been obsolete among sound 
philosophei’s 

to which i reply that if such doctrines have been 
pushed into extravagancies with them i have notliing 
to do nor have i any disposition or wish to revive 
them but i do not conceive the doctrine to the ex 
tent to which i have stated it to be at all obyolete — 
that the cause and foundation of the universe is a 
divine mind and from that doctrine it necessarily 
follows that the laws of the universe are in the ideas 
of the divine mind 

 would then as i have said examine t conse 
quences of this doctrine in reference to the question 
of wliich i have spoken and in ordei to dp this it 
may help us if we consider separately the bearing of 



phtlosofht of didoteet 

this doctrine upon separate portions of oar knowledge 
of the universe — separately its bearing upon the laws 
which form the subjectnoiter of different sciences— 
if we take paiiicular human ideas and consider what 
the divine ideas must be with reg to oach of them 

 tidm of space — let us take in the fiit place 
the idea of space concoming this idea we possess 
necessary truths namely ‘the axioms of geometry 
and as necessarily resulting from them the whole body 
of geometry and our former inquiry as narrowed 
within the limits of this idea will be how is it that 
the truths of geometry — b priori triitlis — are univer 
sally verified in the observed plienomeiia of the uni 
veibol and the theist’s answer which we have given 
will now assume this form — this is so because the 
supreme mind has constituted and constitutes the uni 
verse according to the idea of space tie univei 
conforms to the idea of smce and the idea of space 
exists in the human mind — is necessarily evoked and 
awakened in the human mind existing in the universe 
and since the idea of space which is a constituent of 
the universe is also a constituent of the buuian mind 
the consequences of this idea in the universe and in 
the human mind necessarily coincide that is the 
spaded laws of the universe necesijily coincide with 
the spacicu science which man elaborates out of his 
mind 

 to this it may be objected that we suppose the 
idea of space in the divine miucl according to which 
idea among others the universe is constituted to be 
identicalwith the idea of space in the human mind 
and this it may be urged is too limited and material a 
notion of the divine iviind to be accepted by a reve 
rent pliilosophy 

i reply that i suppose the divine idea of space 
and the human idea of space to coincide only so far 
as the human idea goes and that the divine idea 
may easily have so much more luminousneas and com 
prehensiveness as divine ideas may be supposed to 
have compaied with human further that this idea 
of spaoe first of the ideas on which human 



its theqlooioal bkabiiiq 

f 

is founded is the most innlnous sjotd comprdbensive o£ 
such ideas and there ate innumerable other ideas 
the foundations of sciences more or less complete which 
are cxtiemelj obscure and limited in the human nind 
but which must be conceived to be perfectly clear and 
unlimitedly compreheusivo in the divine mind and 
thus the distance between the huinan aud the divine 
mind even as to the viewa which constitute the most 
conilete of the human sciences is as great in our 
view us in any other 

 that the idea of space in the human mind 
though sufficiently clear and comprehenbive to be the 
source of necessary truths is for too obsciuc and limited 
to be regarded as identical with the divine idea will be 
plain to us if we call to mind the perjdexities w liich 
the human mind foils into when it speculates oncem 
ing space infinite an intelligence in which all these 
perplexities should vanish by the light of the idea 
itseli would be infinitely elevated in clearness and 
comprehensiveness of intellectual vision above human 
intelligence even though its idea of hpace should coin 
cide with the human idea as far as the human idea 
goes 

i do not shrink from saying therefore that the 
idea of space wich is a constituent of the human 
mind existing in the universe is as far as it goes 
identical v ith the idea of space which is a constituent 
of the universe and this i give as the answer to 
question how it is that the necessary truths of 
geometry universally coincide with the relations of 
the phenomena of the universe and this moctrine 
it is to be remembered carries us to the further doc 
triue that the idea of space in the human mind is so 
for as it goes coincident with the idea of space in 
the divine mind 

 idea of vw— what i have said of the idea 
of space may be repeated for the moat part with regard 
to the idea of time except that the idea of time as 
such does not give rise to a large collection of neces 
sary truths such as the propositions of qeometxy 
some philosophers regard humber as a modification 



 philosoput of discovery 

or derivative of the idea of time if we accept this 
view we have in the science of arithmetic a body of 
necessary truths which flow from the idea of gkme 
but this doctrine whichever way held does not bear 
much ou the question with which we are now con 
cerned that which we do hold is that the idea of 
time in the human mind is so far as it goes coin 
cident with the idea of time in the divine mind 
and tlat this is the reason why the events of the uni 
verse as contemplated by us conform to necessary 
laws of succession while at the same time we must 
suppose that all the perplexities in the idea of time 
which enibanass the human mind — the perplexities 
for instance which arise from contemplating a past 
and a future eternity are in the divine mind extin 
guished in the light of the idea itself 

space and time have and have generally been re 
garded as having peculiar prerogatives in our specu 
lations concerning the constitution of the universe 
we see and perceive all things as subject to the laws 
of space and time or rather for the term law does 
not here satisfy us as being and happening in space 
and in time and probably most persons will liave no 
repugnance to the doctrine that the divine imiiul as 
well as the human so regards theij and has so con 
stituted them and us that they mast be so regarded 
space and time are human ideas which include all 
objects and events and are the foundation of all human 
science and we can conceive that space and time 
are also divine ideas which the divine mind causes 
to inclucto all objects and events and makes to be the 
foundation of all existence so far as these ideas go 
our doctrine is not difficult or new 

 ideas of force and matter — but what are we 
to say of the ideas which come next in the survey of the 
sciences force and matter these are human ideas 
— the foundations of several sciences — of the mecha 
nical sciences in particular but are they the founda 
tions of necessary truths have we necessary truths 
respecting force and matter we have endeavoured 
to prove that we have tbat certain fundamental pro 



its theolooical beaiiino 

positions in the science of mechanics althongli his 
torically speaking they wre discovered by observa 
tion and experience are yet philosophically speaking 
necessary propositions and being such the facts of 
the universe must needs conform to these propositions 
and the reason why they do so we hold in this as in 
the former ciise to be that these ideis foioe and 
matter arc ideas in the divirie mind — ideas accord 
ing to which the universe is by the divine cause 
constituted and established 

 that force and matter are ideas existing in 
the divine mind and coincident with the idea of force 
and matter in the human mind as far as these go 
is a doctrine which is imortant in our view of the 
universe in relation to its cause and foundation 

these are very comprehensive and fundamental 
ideas and there are ccitain universal relations among 
external things which rest upon these ideas the two 
force aud matter are in a certain way the necessary 
antithesis and opposite condition each of tlie other 
fom that is mechanical force pressure or impulse 
cannot act witliout matter to act upon matter tliat 
is body cannot exist without force by wliich it is kept 
in its place by which its parts are held together and 
by whieli it exclwles every other body from the place 
which it occupies we cannot conceive force with 
out mattel or matter avithout force the two ere as 
action and reaction necessarily coordinate and co 
existent in every part of the universe they must be 
so in every part of the universe if there be material 
objects there must be force if there be fofee there 
must be material objects 

our appreheusion of this universal necessity arises 
from our having the ideas of force and matter which 
are human ideajb the actuality of tliis universal anti 
thesis arises from the ideas of force and matter being 
ideas in the divine mind — ideas realized as a paiii of 
the fiindamental constitution of the universe 

that force and matter are thus among the ideas in 
the divine mind and that with them the ideas of 
force and matter in the human mind regarded in their 



 philosophy op discovert 

most general form agree so far ae they go is another 
step iu the doctrine which i am tiying to unfold 
that the ideas of force and matter in the divine 
mind are such as to banish by their own light innu 
merable contradictions and poilexities which darken 
tliese ideas in the human mind is to be supposed and 
thus the divine mind is infinitely luminous and com 
prehensive compared with che human mind 

 flreation of matter — it may perhaps be urged 
as an objection to this doctrine that it asserts matter to 
be a necessary constituent of the univen e and thus 
involves the assehion of the eternity of matter but 
in reality the doctrine asserts matter to be eternal 
only in the way in which time and space are eternal 
whether we hold that there was a creation before 
which time and space did not exist — with the poet 
who says 

ere time and space were time and space were no — 

is not essential to our present inquiry certainly we 
cannot conceive such a state and therefore cannot 
reason about it we have no occasion here to speak 
of creation noi have spoken of it what i have said 
is that space and time force and matter are univer 
sal elements principles constitueijjigi of the universe 
as it is — and nccossaiy ideas of the human mind ex 
isting in that universe if there ever was a creation 
before which matter did not exist it was a creation 
before which force did not exist and in the universe 
as it is the two are necessarily coexistent in the hiumaxi 
thought because they are coexistent in the divine 
thought which makes the world 

we apply then to force and matter the doctrine— 
the platonic doctrine if any one please so to call i 
that the world is constituted according ta the ideas of 
the divine mind and that the human mind appre 
hends the inward and most fundamental relations of 
the universe by sharing in some measure of ihose same 
ideas 

 platnic idem — but do we go on with plate 
to extend this doctrine of ideas to all the objects end 



its theological be abie g 

all the aspects of objects which constitute the material 
universe do we say with plato that there is not 
only an idea of a triangle by conformity to which a 
figure is a triangle but an idea of gold by conformity 
to which a thing is gold and idea of a table by con 
formity to wliich a thing is a table 

wc say none of these things we say nothing 
which at all approaches to them we do not say that 
there is an idea of a triangle the arclietypo of all 
‘triangles we only say that man has an idea of space 
which is an idea of a fundamental reality and that 
therefore from this idea flow real and universal truths — 
about triangles and other figures still less do we say 
that we have an archetypal idea of gold or of a met 
in general or of any of the kinds of objects which 
exist in the world here we part company with plato 
altogether 

but have we any ideas at all with regard to objects 
which we thus speak of as scjarable into kinds we 
can have knowledge — oven exact and general know 
ledge that is science — with regard to such things — 
with regal’d to plants and metals — gold and iron do we 
possess in our minds with regard to those objects any 
ideas any univeisal principles such as we possess with 
regard to geometsal figures or mechanical actions 
and if so are those human ideas verified in the uni 
verse as the ideas hitherto considered are and do 
they thus afford us further examples of ideas in the 
human mind which are also ideas in the divine mmd 
manifested in the constitution of the universe 

 idm of kinds — w e answer yes to thftse ques 
tions on this ground — the objects that exist in the 
world plants and metals gold and iron for example 
in oher thatfc they maybe objects with regard to which 
we can have any knowledge must be objects of distinct 
and definite thought plant must differ from metal 
gold from iron in order that we may know anything 
at b about any of these objects the differences by 
which such objects differ need not necessarily be 
pissed by dejmihtmsf as the difference of a triangle 
and a square are eiqressed j but there must manifestiy 



 eiiilosophy of discovert 

be fixed and definite differenced in order that we may 
have any knowledge about them these kinds of 
things must be so fai distinct and definite as to be 
objects of distinct and definite thought the kinds of 
natural objects must differ and we must think of things 
as of different kinds in order that we may know any 
thing about natural objects living in a world in 
which we exercise our intellect upon the natural ob 
jects which surround us we must regard them as 
distinct from each other in kind wc must have an 
idea of kinds of natural objects 

 the idea of a kind involves this principle 
that where the kiiul differs the properties may differ 
but so fin as the kind is the same the properties con 
templated in framing the notion of each kind are the 
same gold cannot have the distinctive properties of 
iron without being iron 

in the case of human knowledge each kind is 
marked by a word — a name and the doctrine that 
the notion of the kind must be so apidied that this 
ame kind of object shall have the same properties 
has been otherwise expressed by saying that names 
must bo so applied that general propositions may be 
possible wc must so apply the name of gold that we 
may be able to say gold has a scific gravity of a 
certain amount and is ductile in a certain degree 

 but this condition of the names of kinds — 
that they must bo such that general propositions about 
these kinds of objects shall be possible — is it a iiecfes 
sary result of the idea of kind and if so can the 
idea of kind thus implying the use of language and 
a condition dejending on use of language hi an 
idea in the pivine as well as in the human mind 
can it be in this respect like the ideas which we 
have already emsidered space and time force and 
matter 

we cannot suppose that the ideas which exist in 
the divine mind imply in the supreme intelligence 
the need of language like human language eht 
there is no incongruity in supposing that they imply 
that which we takeaa the coruiuion of such hngtmge 



its theological beahing 

aa wc speak of namely distinct thought tliere is 
nothing incongi’uous in supposing that the supreme 
intelligence regards the objects ivhich exist in the 
miiveise as distinct in kind and that the idea of 
kind in the human mind agiees with the idea of 
kind in the divine mind as far as it goes and as 
we have seen the idea of properties is correlative and 
coexistent with the idea bf kind so that the one 
changing the other changes also there is notliing 
incongruous in supposing tliat the divine mind mani 
fests in the universe of which it is the cause and 
foundation these two its coordinate itleiis and that 
the human mind sees that these two ideas are coordi 
nate and coexistent in virtue of its parujiiating in 
these ideas of the divine mind the universe is full 
of thijigs which man perceives do and must differ cor 
respondingly in kind and in properties and this is so 
because the ideus of various kinds and various pro 
perties are part of tho scheme of the universe in the 
divine mind 

 that the ideas of kinds and propei ties as co 
ordinate and interdependent though common to a cer 
tain extent to the liuman and tlic divine mind are 
immeasurably more luminous penetrating and compre 
hensive in the lfine than in the hiituiin mind is 
abundantly evident in fact though man assents to 
such axioms aa these — that the properties of tilings 
depend upon their kinds and that the kinds of 
things are determined by theii properties — yet the 
nature of connexion f kinds and properties is a mat 
ter in which man’s mind is all hut wholly flark and 
on which tho divine mind must be perfectly clear 
for in how few cases — if indeed in any one — can we 
know wliab is the essence of any kind — what is the 
real natvure of the connexion between the character of 
the kind and jts properties yet on this point we must 
suppose that the divine intellect which is the foim 
dation of the world is perfectly clean eveiy kind of 
thing every genus and species of object appears to him 
in its essential character and its propeiiiies foubw as 
necessary consequences he sees the essences of things

altered b our operations upon it iju cannot liave its 
quantity changed and this idea of hubstanoe is uni

and determines the way in which we interpret the facts

necessity though we see how wide is their generality 
this idea of a purpose— of a final cause — then thus 
supplied by our minds is found to be applicable 
throughout the organic world it is in virtue of this 
idea that wo conceive animals and plants os subject to 
diseclse for disease takes place when the parts do not 
fully answer their purpose when they do not do what 
thy ought to do how k it then that we thus find 
an idea which is supplied by our own minds but which 
is exemplified in every part of the organic world here 
perhaps the answer will be readily allowed it is be 
cause thk idea is an idea of the divine mind there 
is a final cause in the constitution of these parts of 
the univeise and therefore wo can interpret them by 
means of the idea of final cause wc can see a pur 
pose because there is a purpose is it too presump 
tuous to suppose that we can thus enter into the ends 
and pui’poses of the divine mind we willingly 
grant and declare that it would be presumptuous to 
suppose that we can enter into them to any but a very 
small degree they doubtless go immeasurably beyond 
our mode of imderstanding or conceiving them but to 
a certain extent we can go we can go so far as to see 
that they are ends and ftirposes it is not a vain pre 
sumption in us to suppose that weknow that the eye 
was made for seeing and the ear forliearing in this 
the most pious of men see nothing impious the most 
cautious philosophers see nothing rash and that we 
can see thus far into the designs of the divine mind 
arises we hold from this — that we have an idea of 
design and of purpose which so far as it is merely 
ljuuf k true and so r is design and purpose ip the 
same sense in the one case and in the other 

i am very fiir from having exhausted the list of 
fundamented ideas which the human mind possesses 
and which have been made the foundations of sdenoes 
of all such ideas i might go on to remark that they 
are of universal validity and application in the region 
of external facts in all the cases i might go on to 
uire how is it that man’s ideas developed in his 
internal world ere found to coincide universally witl

the laws of the external world b what necessity 
on what ground docs this happen and in all cases 
 should have had to reply that this happens and must 
happen because these ideas of the human mind are 
also ideas of the divine mind according to which the 
universe is constituted man has these thoughts and 
sees them verified in the universe becaiise qod had 
these thoughts and exempfifies thm in the universe 

 vman im inmmrahli to but 

of all these ideas i should also have to remark that 
the way in which man possesses them is immeasurably 
obscure and limited in comparison witli the way in 
which god must be stipposed to possess them these 
human ideas though clear and real as far as they go 
in every case run into obscuidty and perplexity from 
which the ideas of the divine ivlind must be supposed 
to be free in every ease man by following the train 
of thought involvel in each idea runs into confusion 
and seeming contradictions it may be that by tliink 
ing more and more and by more and more studying 
the imiverse he may remove some of this confusion 
and solve some of these contradictious but when he 
has done in this way all that he can an immeasurable 
region of confusion and contradiction will still remain 
nor can he ever lipof e to advance very far in dispelling 
the darkness which hangs over the greater part of the 
universe his knowlelge his science his ideas ex 
tend only so far as he can keep his footing in the 
shallow watem which lie on the shore of the vast 
ocean of unfathomable truth 

 but further we have not even so exhausted 
our estimate of the immeftsimible distance between 
the human mind and the divine mind — veiy far from 
it we have only spoken of the smallest portion of the 
region of truth — that about which we have sciencea 
and scientific ideas in that region alone do we claim 
for man the possession of ideas the dearness of which 
has in it something divine but how narrow is the 
province of scienoe compared with the wholp domain 
of human thought i we may enumerate the sdenoea 
of which we have been speaking and which involve

such ideas as i have mentioned how many are theyl 
geometry arithmetic chemistry classification phy 
siology to these we might have added a few others 
as the sciences which deal with light heat polari 
ties geology and the other palietiological sciences 
and there our enumeration at present must stop for 
we can hardly as yet claim to have sciences in the 
rigorous sense in which we use the term about the 
vital powers of man his mental powers his historical 
attributes as language society arts law and the 
like on these subjects few philosophers will pretend 
to exhibit to us ideas of universal validity previiling 
through all the range of observation yet all these 
things proceed according to ideas in the divine mind 
by which the universe and by which man is consti 
tuted in such provinces of knowledge at least wo 
have no difficulty in seeing or allowing how blind 
man is with regard to their fundamental and consti 
tuent principles how weik his reason how limited 
his view if on some of the plainest portions of pos 
sible knowledge man have ideas winch may be regarded 
as coincident to a certain extent with those by which 
the universe m really constituted still on by for the 
largest portion of the things which most concern him 
he has no knowledge but that wmol he derives from 
experience and which he cannot put in so general a 
form as to have any pretensions to rest it upon a 
foundation of coiuiate ideas 

 science advances towards the divine ideas — 
but there is yet one remark tending somewhat in the 
opikisite direction which i must make as a part of 
the view which t wish t present science in the 
rigorous sense of the term involves we have said 
ideas which to a certain extent agree with the ideas 
of the divine mind but science in that sense ia 
gressive new sciences are formed and old sciences 
extended hence it follows that the ideas which man 
has and which agree with the ideas of the divine 
mind may receive additions to their number from 
time to time this may seem a hold assertion yet 
this is what with due restrietion we ooneeive to be 



its theologicali beabikg 


 


tnie such ideas as we have spoken of receive addi 
tions in respect of their manifestation and develop 
ment the ideas the germ of them at least were in 
the human mind before but by the progress of scien 
tific thought they are unfolded into clearness and dis 
tinctness that this takes place with regard to scien 
tific ideas the history of science abundantly shows 
the ideas of space and time indeed were clear and 
distinct from the first and accordingly the sciences of 
geometry and arithmetic have exist from the ear 
liest times of man’s intellectual history but the ideas 
upon which tlie science of mechanics depends having 
been obscure in the ancient world are become clear in 
modern times the ideas of composition and reso 
lution have only in recent centuries become so clear 
as to be the basis of a definite science the idea of 
substance indeed was always assumed though vaguely 
applied by the ancients and tlie idea of a design or 
end in vital structures is at least as old as socrates 
but the idea of polarities wiis never put forth in a 
distinct form till quite recently and the idea of suc 
cessive causation as applied in geology and in the 
other falsetiological sciences was never scientifically 
applied till mcern times and without attempting 
to prove the poipt by enumeration it will hardly be 
doubted that many scientific ideas are clear and dis 
tinct among modern men of science which wore not so 
in the ancient days 

now all such scientific ideas ore as i have been 
urging points on which the human mind is a reflex of 
the divine mind and therefore in the progress of 
science we obtain not indeed new points where the 
human mind reflects the divine but new points where 
this reflection is clear and luminous we do not assert 
that the progress of science can bring into existence 
new elements of truth in the human mind but it may 
bring them into view it cannot add to the characters 
of divine origin in the human mind but it may add 
to or tmfold the proofs of such an origin and this is 
what we conceive it does and though we not con 
ceive that the ideas which science thus brings into 



 philosophy of discovbey 


view are the most important of mans thoughts in 
other respects yet they may and we conceive do sup 
ply a proof of the divine nature of the human mind 
wliich proof is of peculiar cogency what other proo 
may be collected from other trains of human thought 
we shall hereafter consider 

 recapitvlation — this then is the argument to 
which we have been led by the survey of the sciences in 
which we have been engaged — that the human mind 
can and does put forth out of its natural stores duly 
unfolded certain ideas as the bases of scientific truths 
these ideas are universally and constantly verified in 
the universe and the reason of this i that they 
agree with the ideas of the divine mind according to 
which the univeme is constituted and sustained the 
human mind has thus in it an element of resemblance 
to the divine mind to a certain extent it looks 
upon the universe as the divine mind does and there 
fore it is that it can see a jxirtion of the truth and 
not only can the human mind thus see a portion of the 
truth as the divine mind sees it but this portion 
though at present immeasurably small and certain 
to be always immeasurably small compared with the 
whole extent of truih which with greater intellectual 
iowers he might discern nevgrthelqss may increase 
from ago to age 

this is then conceive one of tlic results of the 
progress of scientific discovery — the theological besult 
of the philosophy of discovery as it may i think not 
unfitly be called — that by every step in such dis 
covery by which external fects assume the aspect of 
necessary consequences of our ideas we obtain a fresh 
proof of the divine nature of the human mind and 
though these steps however far we may go in this 
path can carry us only a very little way in the know 
ledge of the universe yet that such knowledge so far 
as we do obtain it is divine in its kind and shows 
that the human mind has something divine in its 
nature 

the progress by which external facts assume the 
aspect of necessary consequences of our ideas we have 



its theological bearing 


 


termed the idealization of facta and in thia senae we 
have faid that the progress of science consists in the 
idealization of facts but there is another way in 
which the operation of man’s mind may be considered — 
an opposite view of the identification of ideas with 
facte which we must consider in order to complete our 
view of the bearing of the progress of human thought 
upon the nature of man 



chapter xxxi 
man’s knowledge of god 


i an’s powers and means of knowledge are so 

avjl limited and linerfect tliat lie can know lutl 
concerning god it is well that men in tlieir theo 
logical speculations should recollect that it is so and 
should pursue all such speculations iu a modest and 
humble spirit 

but tlus humility and modesty defeat their own 
ends when they lead us to think that we can know 
nothing concerning god for to bo modest and humble 
in dealing with this subject implies that we know thio 
at least that god is a proper object of modest and 
humble thought 

 some philosophers hayo been led however by 
an examination of man’s faculties and of the nature of 
being to the conclusion that maif san know clothing 
concerning god but we may very reasonably doubt 
the truth of this conclusion we may ask how can 
we jenow that we can know nothing if we can know 
nothing we cannot even know that 

it is rnuch more reasonable to begin with things 
tiukt we ially do know and to examine how r such 
knowledge can carry us respecting god as well as 
anything else this is the course which we have been 
following and its results are vexy far iixm being 
trifling or unimportant 

in tiius beginning what we know ve start 
om two pointadn eadx of which we have we oon 
emve some real and sure knowledge — nafnely mathe 
matical and physical knowledge of the universe with 
out us and a knowledge of our own moral and per 
sonal nature wtttiin us 



mans knowlbdab op god 

 from nature we uam eomething of god — 
pursuing the first line of thought we are led to reason 
thus the universe is governed by certain ideaa for 
instance everything which exists and happens in the 
universe exists and happens nr space and time why 
is this it is we conceive because god has consti 
tuted and constitutes the universe so that it may be 
so that is because the ideas of space and of time are 
ideas according to which god has established and up 
holds the universe 

but we may proceed further in this way as we have 
already said the universe not only exists in space 
and time but it has in it substances — material sub 
stances or taking it collectively material substance 
can we know anything concerning this substance 
yes something we can know for we know that ma 
terial substance cannot be biought into being or anni 
hilated by any natural process we have then an idea 
of substance which is a law of the universe how is 
this — we reply that it is because our idea of sub 
stance is an idea on which god has established and 
upholds the universe 

can we proceed further tdl can we discern any 
other ideas according to which the universe is consti 
tuted yes as we have already reinaiked we can 
discern several though as we go on from one to an 
other they become gradually fainter in their light less 
cogent in their necessity we can see that foice as 
well as material substance is an idea on which the 
universe is constituted and that force and mfuter are 
a necessary and universal antithesis we cah see that 
the things which occupy the universe must be of infi 
nite kiif in order thirt an intelligent mind may 
occupy itself about them and thus that the idea id 
kind is a constitutive idea of the universe we can 
aee thait some kinds of thii have life and our idea 
of life is that every part of a thing is a means 
to an end recognize or final 

cause as an ldsa wluch prevails throughout the uni 
verse and we reoqgnji® this idea as an id according 
to which god oonstittttes and upholds the universe 



 philosophy op discovbet 

since we know so mucli concerning the universe 
and since eveiy law of the universe which is a ne 
cessary form of thought about the universe must 
exist in the divine mind in order that it may iind 
a place in mr minds how can we say that we can 
know nothing concerning the divine mind 

 tiumgh but little — but on the other hand we 
easily sec how little oui knowledge is compared with 
what we do not know even the parts of our know 
ledge which are the clearest are fdll of perjilexities 
and of the laws of the universe including living 
as well as lifeless things how small a portion do we 
know at all 

even the arts of our knowledge which are the clear 
est i say are full of perdexities infinite space and 
an infinite past an infinite future — how helplessly 
our reason struggles with these aspects of our ideas 
and with regard to substance how did ingenerable and 
indestructible substance come into being and with 
regard to matter how can passive matter be endued 
with living force and with regard to kinde how 
immeasurably beyond our power of knowing are their 
numbers and their outward differences still more their 
internal differences and central essence and with 
regard to the design which wc seoi in the organs of 
living things though we can confidently say we see it 
how obscurely is it shown and how much is our view 
of it disturbed by other laws and analogies and 
the life of things the end to which such design tends 
how full of impenetiuble mysteries is it or ratiier how 
entirely amass of mysgw to which our powers of 
knowledge strive in vain penetrate 

there is therefore no danger that by following this 
train of thought we should elevate our view of man too 
high or bring down god in our thoughts to the like 
ness of man even if we were to suppose the idea of 
the divine mind to be the same kbid ae the ideas 
of the human mind the very few ideas of this kind 
which man possesses eompared with the whole xange 
of the universe and the scanty length to which he ooit 
follow each me his knowledge so sifiall and ixnpeiv 



man’s knowledde oe gob 

feet fhftb lie has abundant reason to be modest and 
humble in hijs contemplations concerning the intelli 
gence that knows all and constitutes all he can as 
i have already said wade but a few steps into the 
margin of the boundless and unfathomable ocean of 
tiaith 

 but the ideas of the divine mind must necessarily 
be different in kind as well as in number nnd extent 

from uie ideas of the human mind on this veiy account 
that they are complete and perfect tlie mind which 
can conceive all the parts and laws of the universe in 
all their mutual bearings fundamental reasons and 
remote consequences must be different in kind as 
well as in extent from the mind which can only trace a 
few of these parts and see these laws in a few of their 
aspects and cannot sound the whole depth of any of 
them the divine mind differs from the human in 
the way in which wc must needs suppose what is di 
vine to differ from what is human 

 it has somefamos been said that the divine mind 
differs from the human as the infini from the finite 
and this has been given as a reason why we cannot 
know anything concerning god for wo cannot it is 
said know anything conceming the infinite our 
conception of the infinite being merely negative the 
negation of a limif makes all knowledge about it im 
possible but this is not truly said our conception 
of the infinite is not merely negative as i have 
elsewhere remarked our conception of the infinite is 
positive in this way that in order to form this con 
ception we bn to follor ven idea ina given 
direction and then having begun we suppose 
that the progress of thought goes on in that direction 
without limit to arrive at our idea of infinite space 
for example we must determine what kind of space 
we mean — line area or solid and from what origin 
we begin and infinite space jjas different attributes 
as wo take different beginnings in this way 

and so with regardto the kinds of iiity for 
there are many irhichbelong to the divine mind 
wo have a few ideas whidbi represent the iws of the 



 o philosophy op discovery 

imiverae — as space time substance force matter 
kind end of such ideas the divine mind may have 
an infinite number these ideas in the human mind 
are limited in depth and clearness in the divine mind 
they must be infinitely clearer uian the clearest human 
intuition infinitely more profound than the profound 
est human thought and in this way and as we shall 
see in other ways also the divine mind infinitely 
transcends the human mind when most fully instructed 
and unfolded 

in this way and in other ways also i say for we 
have hitherto spoken of the human mind only as con 
templating the external world — as discerning to a cer 
tain small extent the laws of the universe we have 
spoken of the world of things without we must now 
speak of the world within us — of the woild of our 
thoughts our being our moral and personal being 

 from ourselves we learn something concerning 
god — yf e must speak of this for this is as i have 
said another starting point and another line in which 
we may proceed om what we know and see how far 
our knowledge carries us and how far it teaches us 
anything concerning god 

looking at ourselves we perceive that we have to 
act as well as to contemplate ive are practical as 
well as speculative beings and tracing the nature 
and conditions of our actions in the depths of our 
thought we find that there is in the aspect of actions 
a supreme and inevitable distinction of right and 
wrong we cannot help judging of our actions as 
right add wrong we acknowledge that theie must 
be such a judgment appropriate to them we have 
these ideas of and wrong attribates of actions 

and thus we are pwral beiugs 

 and again the actions are owr actions wo 
act in this way or that and tos are not mere things 
which move and change as they are acted on but whhfii 
do not themselves act eh maa acts i am not a thing 
but a person and tlm mon with whom i act who act 
with meact in various ways towards me w or ill 
•are also persons man is a pmonal being 



uans kkowlbdoe ow god 

tbe ideas of right and wrong — the tnoral ideas of 
maniare then a part of the scheme of the universe to 
which man belongs could they he this if they were 
not also a part of the nature of that divine mind 
which constitutes the universe — it would seem not 
the moral law of the universe must be a law of the 
divine klind in order that it may be a law felt and 
discerned by man 

 objection mewered — but it may be objected 
the moral law of the univeise is a law in a different 
sense from the laws of the universe of which we spoke 
before — the mathematical and physical laws of the 
universe those were laws according to which things 
ore and events occur but moiul laws are laws ac 
cording to which men ougm to act and according to 
which actions mghjt to be there is a difference so 
that we cannot reason from the human to the divine 
mind in the same manner in this case as in the other 

time we cannot reason in tjie same tuanner but 
we can reason still more confidently for the law 
directing what ouglu to he is the supieme law and 
the mind wliich constitutes the supreme law is tho 
supreme mind that is the divine mind 

 that the moral law is not verified among men 
in tact is not a ground for doubting that it is a law 
of the divine mind but it is a ground for inquiring 
what consequences the divine mind has annexed to 
the violation of the law and in what manner the 
supremacy of the law will be established in the total 
course of the history of the universe including it may 
be the history of other worlds than that in which we 
now live 

considering how dimly and imperfectly we see what 
consequences the divine governor has annexed to the 
violation of the moral law he who sees all these 
consequences and has provided for the establishment 
of his law in the whole history of the human race 
must be supposed to be infinitely elevated above man 
pi wisdom — more even in rffeue of this aspect of his 

from 


nature than in virtue of that which is derived 



 philosophy of discovery 

 man is a person and his personality is his highr 
est atttibufce or at least that which makes all his highest 
attributes possible and the highest attribute which 
belongs to the finite minds which exist in the univeise 
must exist also in the infinite mind which constitutes 
the universe as it is the divine mind must reside 
in a dlmm person and as man by his personality 
acts in obetlience to or in transgression of a moral 
law so god by his peisonality acts in establishing 
the law and in securing its supremacy in tlic whole 
history of the world 

 creivfion — acknowledging a divine mind 
which is the foundation and suppoit of the world as it 
is constituting and upholding its laws it may be asked 
does this view point to a beginning of the world 
was there a time when the divine mind called into 
being the world before nonexistent was there a 
creation of the world 

t do not think that an answer to this question 
given either way afieots the argument which i have 
been urging the laws of the universe discoverable 
by the human mind are the laws of the divine 
ind whether or not there was a time when these 
laws first came into operation or first produced the 
world which we sec the argument respecting the 
natime of the divine mind is the same whether or 
not we suppose a creation 

but in point of fact every part of our knowledge 
of the universe does seem to point to a beginning 
every part of the world has been so far as we ean 
see formed by natural causes out of something differ 
ent from what it now is the earth with its lands 
and seas teeming with innumerable forms of living 
things has been produced from an eaith formed of 
other lands and seas ocqupied with quite diffetemt 
forms of life and if we go fkr enough back from au 
earth in which there was no life the stars which wa 
calljbscf move and change the nebals in their shape 
show that they too are moving and changing the 
earth was some at least hold produced by the con 
densation of a nebula the hiiry of man ea well 



han’b knowledge oe god 

as of others of its inhabitants points to a beginning 
languages arts governments histories all seem to 
have begun from a startingpoint however remote 
indeed not only a beginning but a beginning at no 
remote period appears to be indicated by most of the 
sciences which cany us backwards in the world’s his 
tory 

but wo must allow on the other hand that though 
all sucil lines of resoarcli point timrds a beginning 
none if them can be followed up to a beginning all 
the lines converge but all melt away before they reach 
the point of convergence as i have elsewhere said 
in no science has man been able to arrive at a begin 
ning which is homogeneous with the knovl course of 
events though we can often go very fiir back and 
limit the hyiwthcsea respecting the origin we have 
in the impossibility of thus coining to any conclusion 
by natural reason on the subject of creation another 
evidence of the infinitely limited nature of the human 
mind when compared with the creative or constitu 
tive divine mind 

 eid of the worlds — but if our natural reason 
aided by all that science can teach can tell us nothing 
respecting the origin and beginning of this world still 
less can ieason tel us anything with regard to the 
end of this world on this subject the natural 
sciences are even more bairen of instruction than on 
tlie subject of creation yet we may say that as the 
constitution of the universe and its conformity to a 
collection of eternal and immutable ideas as its ele 
ments are not inconsistent with the supposition of a 
beginning of the present course of the world so nei 
ther are they inconsistent evith the supposition of an 
end indeed it would not be at all impossible that 
physical inquiries should present the prospect of an 
esud even more clearly than they afibixl the retrospect 
of a beginning if for instance it should be found 
that jke planets move in a resisting medium which 


 itist iini sft k sylil e vl mci 




 philsphy of disooveet 

constantly retards their velocity and must finally 
make them fall in upon the central siin there would 
be an end of ilie earth as to its present state we can 
not therefore on the grounds of science deny either a 
beginning or an end of the present world 

 but here another order of considerations comes 
into play namely those derived from moral and theo 
logical views of the world on these we must in con 
clusion say a few words 

tt is very plain that these considerations may lead 
us to believe in a view of the beginning middle and 
end of the liisury of the world very different from 
anything which the mere physical and natural sciences 
can disclose to us and these expressions to which i 
have been led the beginning the middle and the 
end of the world’s history according to theological 
views are full of suggestions of the highest interest 
but the interest which belongs to these suggestions is 
of a solemn and peculiar kind and the considerations 
to which such suggestions point are better i think 
kept apart fi’om such speculations as those with wdiich 
 have been concerned in the present volume

analoqi£s of physical and religious philosophy 


i a ny assertion of analy letween physical and 

jljl religious philosophy will very projerly be 
looked upon with great jealousy as likely to be forced 
and delusive and it is only in its most general aspects 
that a sound philosophy on the two subjects can offer 
any points of resemblance but in some of its general 
conditions the discovery of truth in the one held of 
knowledge and in the other may offer certain analo 
gies os well os differences which it may be instructive 
to notice and to some such aspects of our philosophy 
 shall venture to refer 

for the physical sciences — the sciences of observa 
tion and speculation — tbe progress of our exact and 
scientific knowledge as i have repeatedly said con 
sists in ieduciug tlie objects and events of the universe 
to a conformity with ideas which wc have in our own 
minds — the ideas for instance of space force sub 
stance and the like in this sense the intellectual 
progiss of men consists in the idealization of facta 

 in moral subjects on the other hand where 
man has not merely to observe and speculate ut also 
to act — where he does not passively leave the foots 
and events of the world sudi as they ae but tries 
actively to alter them and to improve the existing 
state of thongs his progiess consists in doing this he 
makes a mozut advance when he succeeds in doing 
what he thus attempts — when he really improves the 
state of things with which he has to do by removing 
etil and prcducing good — when he makes the state 
f things namely the relations between him and otiier 
persons his acts and their acts confbnn more and 

co 



 fhilobofiit of discoveet 

more to ideas which he has in his own mind — 
namely to the ideas of justice benevolence and the 
like his moral progress thus consists in the realisa 
tion of ideas 

and thus we are led to the aphorism as we may 
call it that marca intdlectual progress consists in the 
idecblizcuion of faefs and his moral progress consists 
in the pealizaiion of ideas 

 but further though that progress of science 
which consists in the idealization of facts may be 
carried through several stages and indeed hi the liis 
tory of science has been canied through many stages 
yet it is and always must be a pvogiess exceedingly 
imperfect and incomplete when compared with the 
completeness to which iis nature iioints only a few 
bcicnces have made much progress none are com 
plete mobt have advanced only a step or two in 
none have we reduced all the facts to ideas in 
all or almost all the unrcvluced pacts arc fu more 
numerous and extensive than those which have been 
reduced the general mass of the facts of the uni 
verse are mere facts unsubdued to the rule of science 
the facts are not idealized the intellectual pro 
gress is miserably scanty and imperfect and would be 
so even if it were carried mucli furtlier than it is 
carried how can we hope that it will ever aiiproach 
to completeness 

 and in like manner the moral progress of man 
is still more miserably scanty and incomjilete in 
how small a degree has he in this sense realized his 
ideas in how small a degree has he carried into 
real effect and embodied in the relations of society in 
his own acts and in thosevof others with whom jke is 
concerned the ideas of justice and benevolence and 
the like how far from a complete realization of such 
moral ideas are tlie acts of the best men and the iela 
tions of the best forms of society how for fixm per 
fection in these respects is man and how certain it 
is that he will always be very far from perfectiojal 
far below oven such perfection os he can conccivn he 
vill always be in his acts and feelinga the moral 



physioaii and eeugious philosophy 

progress of man of each man and of each society is 
as haye said miserably scanty and incomplete and 
hen regarded as the realization pf hls moral ideas 
its scantiness and incompleteness become still more 
manifest than before 

uence we are led to another aphonsm — that 
tihana progress in the recdimtion of moral ideas and 
his progress in the scieruifie idealization of factsy arcy 
and cdrmys will he exceedingly scanty and incomplete 

 but there is another asect of ideas both phy 
sical and moral in which this scantiness and incom 
pleteness vanish in the divine mind all the phy 
sical ideas aro entertained with complete fulness and 
luminousness and it is because they are so enter 
tained in the divine mind and it is beeause the uni 
verse is constituted and framed upon them tliat we 
find them verified in every jiart of tlie universe when 
ever we make our observation of facts and deduce 
thdir laws 

in like manner the moral ideas exist in the divine 
mind in coindote fulness and lumiiiousness and we 
are natumlly led to believe and expect that they must 
be exemplified in the moral universe as completely 
and universally as the physical laws arc exemplified in 
the physical univeme is this sol or under what con 
ditions can we conceive this to be 

 in answering this question we must consider 
how fislr the moral still more even than the physical 
ideas of the divine mintl are elevated above our 
human ideas but yet not so far as to have qo resem 
blance to our cottesponding human idejis for if this 
wore so we could not reason about them at all 

in speaking of man’s moral ideas bevolence 
justice and the like we speak of them as lielonging 
to man’s stndy rather than to his mindy which we have 
commonly spoken of as the seat of his physical ideas 
a distinction is thus often made between the intel 
•lectual and the moral faculties of man but on this 
distinction we here lay no stress we may speak oi 
inans mind and sovly meaning that part of his being 
in which are all his ideas intdlectual and moral 

co a 



 philosophy op discovert 

and now let ns consider the question which has 
just been asked — how we can conceive the divine 
benevolence and jvisticc to bo completely and univer 
sally realized in the moral worl as the ideas of 
space time are in the physical world 

 our ideas of benevolence justice and of other 

virtues may be elevated sbove their original narrow 
ness and puiified from their original coarseness by moral 
culture as our ideas of force and matter of sub 
stance and elements and the like may be made clear 
and convincing by philosophical and scicntiiic culture 
this appears in some degree in the hibtoiy of moral 
terms as the progies of clearness and efficacy in the 
idea of the material sciences apear in the history of 
the terms belonging to such sciences thus among 
the homans while they confined their kindly affections 
within their own class a stranger was universally an 
enemy was synonymous with hoatia but 

at a later period they regarded all mm as having a 
claim on their kiiidnesj and he who felt and acted on 
this claim was called humam this meaning of the 
word humanity hows the progress in their ideas at 
least of the irtue which the word humanity desig 
nates 

 and as man can thus rise to a point of view 
where he sees that man is to be loved as man so the 
humane and loving man inevitably assumes that ood 
loves all men and thus assumes that there is or may 
be a love of man in man’s heart which represents and 
resemble in kind however remote in degree the love 
of grod to man 

but as in man’s love of man there are very widely 
different sfietges rising fromthe narrow love of a savage 
to his mily or his tribe to the widest and 
feelings of die most enlightened and loving universal 
philanthropist — so must we sujipose that there are 
stages immeasurably wider by which god’s love of 
man is more comprehensive azid more tender than any 
love of man for mam the religious philosopher wiu 
fully assent to the expressions of this conviction d 
livered by pious men in ell ages the eternal god jb 



physical and beligious philosophy 

thy refuge and beneath thee are the everlasting arms 
“when my father and my mother forsahe me the lord 
taketh mg up is the expression of divine love con 
sistent with philosophy as well as with revelation but 
as the divine love is more comprehensive and enduring 
tlian any human love so is it in an immeasurably greater 
degree more enlightened it is not a love that seeks 
merely the pleasure and gratification of its object tjuit 
even an enlightened hunutu love does not do it seeks 
the good of its olyjects and such a good as is the great 
est good to an intelligence which can embrace all 
cases causes and contingencies to our limited un 
derstanding evil sgms often to be inflicted and the 
good of a part seems inconsistent with the good of an 
otlicr part our atumpts to conceive a supreme and 
complete good provided for all the creatures which 
exist in tlie universe bafilc and peqdex us even more 
than our attempts to conceive infinite space infinite 
time and an infinite chain of causation but as the 
most careful attention which wo can give to the ideas 
of space time and tausation convinces us that these 
ideas ai’e perfectly clear and comjdete in the divine 
mind and that our jerplexity and confusion on these 
subjects arise only from tho vast distance between the 
divine mind and cgir human mind so is it reasonable 
to suppose the same to be the source of the confusion 
which wo experience when we attempt to determine 
what most conduces to tho good of our fellowcrea 
tures and when urged by love to them wo endeavour 
to promote this good we can do little of what infi 
nite love would do yet are we not thereby dispensed 
fiom seeking in some dco to imitate the working of 
divine love we can see •but little of what infimte 
jntdhgence secs and this should bo one source of con 
fidejftie and comfort when we stumble upon perplexi 
ti produced by the seeming mixture of good and vil 
in the world 

 but when we ask tho questions which have already 
been stated whether this infinite divine love is real 
ized in the world and if so how i conceive that we 
 irresistibly impelled to reply the formed question 



 philosophy op discovprt 

that it is and we then turn to the latter we are led 
to assume that there is in god an infinite love of 
man a creature in a certain degree of a diviie nature 
we must ae a coosoquence of this assume that the 
love of god to man necessarily is in the end and on 
tlie whole completely and fully realized in the history 
of the world but what is the complete histoiy of the 
world is it that which consists in the lives of men such 
as we see them between their birth and their death if 
the minds or souls of men are alive aftei the death of 
the body that future life as well as this present life 
belongs to the history of the world — to that provi 
dential history of which the totality as we have said 
must bo governed by infinite divine love and in 
addition to all other reasons for believing that the 
minds and souls of men do thus survive their present 
life is this — that we thus can conceive what other 
wise it is difficult or impossible to conceive the opera 
tion of infinite love in the whole of the history of 
mankind if there be a future state in which men’s 
souls are still under the authority and direction of the 
divine governor of the world all that is here wanting 
to complete the scheme of a perfect govemmont of 
intelligent iove may thus be applied all seeming and 
partial evil may he absorbed and vxiinguished in an 
ultimate and universal good 

lo the idea of justice ea belonging to god sug 
gests to us some of the same kind of reflexions as 
those which we have made respecting the divine love 
we believe god to be just otherwise as has been 
said he would not be god and as we thus from 
the nature of our minds and souls believe god to be 
just we must in this bel understand justice ac 
corffing to the idea which wo have of justice that is 
in some measure according to the idea of jxistioe as 
exemplified in human actions and feelings it would 
be absurd to combine the two propositions that we 
necessarily believe that ghd is just and that by justy 
we mean something entirely different from the com 
mon meaning of the word 

but thou the divine idea of justice must imeea 



phtslcii and religious philosopht 

wily in some meaeure coincide witli onr idea of 
justice we must believe in fhis as in other cases that 
the diviiie idea is immeasurabljr moi profound com 
prehensive and clear than the ifuman idea even 
the human idea of justice is susceptible of many and 
largo progiessive steps in the way of clearness con 
sistency and comprehensiveness in the mural history 
of man this idea advances from the hard rigour of in 
flexible written law to tlie ecpritable cmtij nation of the 
real circumstances of each case it advances also from 
the nariow law of a single community to a larger law 
which includes andolves the conflicts of all such 
laws further the administration of human law is 
always imperfect often erroneous in consequence of 
man’s imperfect knowledge of the facts of each case 
and still more from his ignorance of the designs and 
feelings of the actors if the j udge could see into the 
heart of the person accused and could himself rise 
higher and higher in judicial wisdom he might exem 
plify the idea of j ustice in a far liigher degree than 
has ever yet been done 

i but all such advance in the improvement of 
human justice must still be supposed to stop immea 
surably short of the divine justice which must in 
clude a perfect kittwledge of all men’s actions and all 
men’s hearts and thoughts and a universal application 
of the wisest and most comprehensive laws and the 
diflferenco of the divine and of the human idea of 
justice may like the diflerences of other divine and 
human ideas include the solution of all the perplexi 
ties in which we find ourselves involved when we 
would tiaoe the idea to all its consequences the di 
vine idea is immeasurably elevated above the human 
idea in the divine idea all inconsistency defect and 
incompleteness vanish and justice includes in its ad 
ministration every man without any admixture of in 
justice this is what we must conceive of the divine 
administration since gkd is perfectly just 

 but here as before we have another eonclir 
aion suggested to us we or by the oonsideratioiib 
just now spoken led to belieye tbat in the divine 



 jpfiiiiosophy oy disootsbt 

adminibtratioii of the worid is an adxxunistzacm of 
perfect justice tlibt is such istlie ditine admiuis 
tration in the end and on the whole takixig into ac 
count the whole of the providential history of the 
world but the course of the world taking into ac 
count only what happens to man in this present life 
is not we may venture to say a complete and entire 
administration of justice it often happens that in 
justice is successm and triumphant even in the end 
so far os the end is seen here it happens that wrong 
is done and is not remedied or punished it happens 
that blameless and viituoub men are subjected to paiu 
grief violence and oppression and are not protected 
extricated or aveng in tne affairs of this world 
the prevalence of injustice and wrongdoing is so ap 
parent as to be a common subject of comlaint and 
though the complaint may be exaggerated and though 
a calm and comprehensive view may often discern com 
pegiisatiug and remedial induences which are not visible 
at first sight slall we cannot tegard the lot of happiness 
or miiy which fidls to each man in this world and 
this lire as apportioned according to a schcnip of per 
fect and universal justice such as in otir thoughts we 
cannot but require the bivine administration to be 

 here then we are again le to the same con 
viction by regarding the divine acbmiitration of the 
 world ashe jroalization of the divine justice to which 
we were before led regarding it as the realization 
of the divine love feince the idea is not fully or 
completely tealized in man’s life in this present world 
this presdltit world cannot be the whole of the divine 
administration to complete the realimtion of the 
idea of justice as an element of the divine adminis 
tration there must be a life of man after his life in 
this present world if man’s mind and soul the part 
of him which is susceptible of happiness and miseiy 
buve this present life and be still subject to the 
divine admimstration the idea of divine justice 
may still be completely realized notwithstanding ou 
that hero looks like injustice or defective justice 
it belongs to the idea of justice to remedy and com

 t 

pensaio not to prevent wrongs thne by this 

supposition of a future state of man’s existoacei we 
are enabled to oouoeive that in the whole of the di 
vme gkvernment of the universe seeming injustice 
ajid wrong may be finally corrected and rectified in an 
ultimate and universal establishment of a ren of per 
feet bighteousneas 

 admitting the view thus presented we may 
again discern a remarkilble analogy becwceu what 
have called our physical ideas those of space time 
cause substance and the like and our nkoral ideas 
those of benevolence justice c in both classes we 
must suppose that our human ideas represent though 
veiy incompletely and at ftn immeasurable distance 
the pivine ideas even our physical ideas when pur 
sued to their consequences are involved in a perlexity 
and confusion from which the pivine ideas are iim 
our ideas of benevolence and justice are still more 
full of imperfections and inconsistency when we would 
frame them into a complete scheme and yet from such 
imperfections and inconsistency we must suppose that 
the divine benevolence and justice are exempt our 
physical ideas we find in every case exactly exempli 
fied d realized in the universe and we account for 
this by cousidoiing that tjicy are the divine idea on 
which the universe is constituted our moral ideas 
tho ideas of benevolence and justice in particular v 
must also be realized hi the universe as a scheme of 
divine ooemment but they are not realized in 
tho world as constituted of man living this present 
life the divine scheme of the world theibfore ex 
tends beyond this present life of man if we could 
include hi our survey the future life as well as the 
present life of man and tlie future course of the di 
vine qovernment we should have a scheme of the 
moral government of the universe in which the ideas 
of perfect benevolence and perfect justioq are as com 
pletely and universally exemplified and realized as the 
idc of space time cause substance and the like 
ereiiln the physical universe 

 there is one other remark bearing upon this 



 philosophy op discovert 

analogy which seems to deseite our attention as i 
have said in the last chapter the scheme of the world 
as governed by our physical ideas seems to point to 
a beginning of the world or at least of the present 
coume of the world and if we suppose a beginning 
our thoughts naturtdly turn to an end but if our 
physical ideas point to a beginning and suggest an 
end do our ideas of divine benevolence and justice 
in any way lend themselves to this suggestion — 
perhaps we might venture to say that in some degree 
they do even to the eye of a mere philobopliical reason 
perhaps our reason alone might suggest that there 
is a progression in the human race in various moral 
attributes — in art in civiliation and even in humanity 
and in justice which implies a beginning and that 
at any rate there is nothing inconsistent with our idea 
of the diving oovemment in the supposition that the 
history of this world has a beginning a middle and 
an end 

 if therefore there should be convoyed to us 
by some channel esjecially appropriated to the com 
munication and development of moral and religious 
idens the knowiodgo that the world as a scheme of 
divine government has a beginning a middle and 
om end of a kind or at least invested wrth cir 
cumstances quite different from any which our physi 
cal ideas can disclose to us there would be in such 
a belief nothing at all inconsistent with the analogies 
which our phdosopliy— the philosophy of our ideas 
illustrated by the whole progress of science — has im 
pressed ifpon us on the gixunds of this philosophy 
we need find no difficulty in believing that as the 
visible universe eashibits the operation of the divino 
ideas of space time cause substance and the like 
and discloses to us traces of a beginning of the pre 
sent mode of operation so the moi universe exhibits 
to us the operation of the divine benevolence and 
justice and that these divine attributes wrought in 
a special and peculiar manner in the beginning inters 
posed in a peculiar and special manner in the middle 
and will again act in a peculiar and speobl manner in 



physical and religious philosophy 

tue ihd of the world and thus the conditions of the 
physical nniverse and the govemment of the moral 
world are both though in different wayi a paiii of the 
work which god is cairying on from the banning of 
things to the end — ojtms quod deua operator a priiv 
cipio uaqiie ad jmem 

 we are led by such analogies as i lave been 
adducing to believe that the whole course of events in 
which the minds and souls of men survive the present 
life and are hereafter subjected to the divine governr 
meat in such a way as to complete all that is here de 
ficient in the world’s histoiy is a scheme of peifect 
benevolence and justice now can wo discern in 
man’s mind or soul itself any indication of a destiny 
like thisl are there in us any powers and fiiculties 
which seem as if they were destined to immortality t 
if there be we have in such faculties a strong confirm 
ation of that belief in the future life of man which has 
already been suggested to us as necessary to render the 
divine govemment conceivable 

 according to our philosophy there arc powers 
and faculties which do thus seem fitted to endure and 
not fitted to terminate and be extinguished the meas 
which we have in our minds — the physical ideas as 
we have called th according to which the universe 
is constituted — agree as far as they go with the ideas 
of tlie divine mind seen in the constitution of the 
universe but these divine ideas are eternal and im 
perishable we therefore naturally conclude tlmt the 
human mind which includes such elemetnts isalso 
eternal and imerishable since the mine can take 
hold of eternal truths it mubt be itjielf eternal since 
it is to a certain extent the imagmf god in its facul 
ties it cannot ever cease to be the image of god 
when it has airived at a stage in which it sees several 
aspects of the universe in the same form in which they 
present themselves to the divine mind we cannot 
suppose that the author of the human mind will allow 
it and all its intellectual light to be extinguished 

 and our conviction that this extinction cf the 
human mind cannot take place becomes stronger stuli 



 philosophy of discoveut 

when we consider that the mind however imperfect 
and scanty its discernment of truth may be is still 
capable of a vast and even of an unlimited progress in 
the pursuit and aprehension of truth the mind is 
capable of accepting and appropriating through the 
action of its own ideas every step in scienco which 
has ever been made — every step which shall hereaiter 
be made can wo suppose tliat this vast and bound 
less capacity exists for a few years only is unfolded 
only into a few of its simplest consequences and is 
then consigned to annihilation can we suppose that 
the wonderful powers which carry man on genemtion 
by generation from the contemplation of one great 
and sti iking truth to another are buried with each 
generation may we not rather suppose that that 
mind which is capable of indefinite progiohsion is 
allowed to exist in an infinite duration during which 
such progression may take place 

 i propose this argument as a grotmd of hope 
and satisfactory reflexion to those who love to dwell on 
the natural arguments for the immortality of the soul 
i do not attenipt to follow it into detail i know too 
well how little such a cause can gain by obstinate and 
complicated argumentation to attempt to urge the 
argument in that manner and probably different per 
sons among those who accept tne argument as vd 
would give different answers to many questions of de 
tail wliich naturally arise out of the aeceptauco of ibis 
argument i will not here attempt to solve or even 
to propound these questions my main purpose in 
offering tsiese views and this argument at al is to 
give some satisfaction to ihose who would think it a 
sad and blank redqjjb of thisjong survey of the nature 
and progress of science in which we have been so long 
engaged through this series of works that it should 
in no way lead to a recognition of the author of that 
world about which our science is and to the high and 
consolatory hopes which lift man beyond this world 
no survey of the universe can be at all satifictory to 
thoughtful men which has not a theological bearing 
nor can any view of man’s powers and means of know 



phtsical and eeliglotr philosophy 

ing be congenial to sncb men whieb doea not recognize 
an iniinite destination for the mind which has an infi 
nite capacity an eternal being of the faculty which 
can take a steady hold of eternal being 

 and as we may derive such a conviction from 
our physical ideas so too may we no less from our 
moral ideas otir minds mprehend space and time 
and force and the like as ideas which are not depen 
dent on the body and henco we bejiove that our minds 
shall not perish with our bodies and in the same 
manner our souls conceive pure benevolence and per 
fect justice which go beyond the conditions of this 
mortal life and hence we believe that our souls have 
to do with a life beyond this mortal life 

it is more diflblcult to spoak of man’s indefinite mo 
ral progression even than of his indefinite intellectual 
progression yet in every path of moral speculation 
we have such a progression suggested to us we may 
begin for instance with the ordinary feelings and 
affections of our daily nature — love hate scorn 
but when we would elevate the soul in our imagina 
tion we ascend above these ordinary affections and 
take the repulsive and hostile ones as htted only to 
balance their own influences and thus the poet 
speaking of a momily poetical nature describes it 

the poet in a golden clime was bom 

with golden stars above 

he felt the hate of hate the scorn of scorn 

the love of love 

but the loftier moralist can rise higher thaif this and 
con and will reject altogether hate and scorn fvom 
hia view of man’s bettes naturei his description 
would rather be — 

the good man in a loving clime was bom 

with loving stars above 

he felt sorrow for hate pity for scorn 

and love of bve 

he would in his conception of such a oharaoteri 
ascribe to it all the yiitues which result from the 



 philosophy op discovery 

control and extinction of theito repulsive and hostilo 
affectionu — the virtaeii of magnanimity forgiving 
ness unselfishness selfdevotion tondemess sweetness 
and these we can conceive in a higher and higher 
degree in proportion as our own hearts become tender 
forgiving pure and unselfish and though in every 
human stage of such a moral proficiency we must 
supose that there is stulsomo struggle with the re 
maining vestiges of our unkind unjust angry and 
selhsh affections we can see no limit to the extent to 
which tliis struggle may be suocessfuj no limit to the 
degree in which these traces of the evil of our nature 
may be worn out by an enduring practice and habit 
of our better nature and when we contemplate a 
human chancter which has through a long course of 
years and through many trials and conflicts made 
a largo progress in this career of melioration and is 
still capable if time be given of further progress 
towards moral perfection is it not reasonable to sup 
pose that he who formed man capable of such ro 
gi’ess and who as we must needs believe looks with 
approval on such progress where made will not allow 
the progi’ess to stop when it has gone on to the end of 
man’s short earthly life is it not rather reasonable 
to suppose that the pure and elevate and albembracing 
affection extinguishing all vices and including all vir 
tues to which the good man thus tends shall continue 
to prevail in him as a permanent and everduring con 
dition in a life after this 

fiut can man raise himself to such a stage of moral 
progress y his own efforts such a progress is an 
approximation towards the perfection of moral ideas 
and therefoi‘e an approximation towards the image of 
ood in whom that perfection resides is it not then 
reasonable to suppose that man needs a divine in 
fluence to enable him to reach this kind of moral 
completeness and is it not also reasonable to sup 
pose that as he needs such aid in order that tho idea 
of his moral progress may be raized so he will receive 
such aid from divine power which realizes the 
jdea of divine love in the world and to do so mus 



physical and eblioious philosophy 

realize it in those human souls which are most fitted 
for such a purpose 

but these questions remind me how difficult and 
indeed how impossible it is to fcalow such tmins of 
reflexion by the light of pliilosophy alone to ahswer 
such questions we need not beligious philosophy only 
but keligion and as do not here venture beyond 
the domain of philosophy i must however abruptly

appendix a 


ofvhe platonic theory of ideas 

cam phu soe nov 


rphough plato has in recent times had many readers and ad 
 mirers among onr english scholars there has been an air of 
unreality and inconsistency about the commendation which most of 
these professed adherents hare giren to his doctrines this appears 
to be no caprioui criticism for instance when those who speak of 
him as immeasurably superior in argument to his opponents do not 
venture to produce his arguments in a definite form as able to bear 
the tug of modern controversy — when they use his own greek 
phrases as essential to the exposition of his doctrines and speak as 
if these phtases could not bo adequately rendered in english 
and when they assent to those among the systems of philosophy of 
modern times which are the most clearly opposed to the system of 
plato it seems not unreasonable to require on the contrary that 
if plato is to supply a philosophy for us it must be a philosophy 
which can be expressed in our own language — that his system if 
we hold it to be well founded shall compel us to deny the opposite 
systems modern as well as ancient — and that so far as we hold 
platos doctrines to be satisfactorily establishtd we should be able 
to produce the arguments for them and to refute the arguments ‘ 
against them these seem reasonable requirements of the ad 
herents of any philosophy and therefore of plato’s 

i regard it as a fortunate circumstance that we have recently 
had presented to u an exposition of plato’s philosophy which does 
conform to thoso reasonable conditions and wo may discuss this 
exposition with the less reserve siuce its accomplished author 
though belonging to this generation is no longer alive refer to 
the lectures on the history of ancient philosophy by the late 
professor butler of dublin in these lectures we find au account 
of the platonic philosophy which shows that the writer had con 
sidered it as what it is an attempt to solve large problems which in 
all ages force themselves upon the notice of thoughtful mett in 
lectures yiu and x of the second series especially we have a 

dd 



 philosophy op discovert 

statement of the platonic theory of ideas which may be made a 
convenient starting point for such remarks as wish at present to 
make i will transcribe this account omitting as do so the 
expressions which proessor butler uses in order to present the 
theory not as a dogmatical assertion but as a view at least not 
extravagant for this purpose he says of the successive portions 
of the theory that one is “not too absurd to be maintained” that 
another is ‘‘not very extravagant either’ that a third is “surely 
allowable” that a fourth presents “no incredible account” of tle 
subject that a fifth is “ no preposterous notion in substance and no 
unwarrantable form of phrase” divested of these modest for 
mula his account is as follows vol ii p j 

mans soul is made to contain not merely a consistent scheme 
of its own notions but a direct apprehension of real and eternal 
laws beyond it these real and eternal laws are things intelligible 
and not things sensible 

“these laws impressed upon creation by its creator and ap 
prehended by man are something distinct equally from the creator 
and from man and the whole mass of them may fairly be termed 
the world of things intelligible 

“farther there are qualities in the supreme and ultimate cause 
of all which are manifested in his creation and not merely mani 
fested but in a manner — after being brought out of his super 
essential nature into the stage of being which is below him but 
next to himare then by the causative act of creation deposited in 
things differencing them one from the other so that the things 
partake of them iercxoiurt communicate with them xoiiouogari 

 the intelligence of man excited to reflection by the impressions 
of these objects thus though themselves transitory participant of 
a divine quality may rise to higher conceptions of the perfections 
tlius faintly exhibited and inasmuch as these perfections are 
unquestionably real existences and known to bo such in the very 
act of contemplation — this may be regarded as a direct intellectual 
apperception of them — a union of the reason with the ideas in 
that sphere of being which is common to both 

“ finally the reason in proportion as it learns to contemplate 
the perfect and eternal desires the enjoyment of such contempla 
tions in a more consummate degree and cannot be fully satisfied 
except in the actual fruition of the perfect itself 

“ these suppositious taken together constitute the theory of 
ideas 

in remarking upon the theory thus presented shall abstain 
from any disenssion of the theological part of it as a subject which 



of the platonic theory of ideas 

 

would probably be considered as unsuited to the meetings of this 
society even in its mahi purely philosophical form but i conceive 
that it will not be inconvenient if it be not wearisome to diseiiss 
the theory of ideas as an ottempt to explain the existence of real 
knowledge which prof butler very rightly considers as the neces 
sary aim of this and cognate systems of philosophy 

 conceive then that one of the primary objects of platos 
theory of ideas is to explain he existence of real knowledge 
that is of demonstrated knowledge such as the propositions of 
geometry offer to us in this view the theory of ideas is one 
attempt to solve a problem much discussed in our times ayhat is 
the ground of geometrical truth do not mean that this is the 
whole object of the theory or the highest of its claims as i have 
said omit its theological bearings and am aware that there aro 
passages in the platonic dialogues in which the ideas which enter 
into the approhonsioii and demonstration of geometrical truths are 
spoken of as subordinate to ideas which have a theological aspect 
but have no douiit that one of the main motives to the construc 
tion of the theory of ideas was the desire of solving the problem 
hlow is it possible that man should ajtpreliend necessary and 
eternal truths that the truths arc necessary makes them eter 
nal for they do not depend on time and that they are eternal 
gvies them at once a theological bearing 

that plato in attempting to explain the nature and possibility of 
real knowledge had in his mind geometrical truths as examples of 
such knowledge is i think evident from the general purport of his 
discourses on such sulyects the advance of greek geometry into 
a conspicuous position at the time when the ileraditean sect were 
proving that nothing could be proved and nothing could be known 
naturally suggested mathematical truth as the refutation of the skep 
ticism of mere sensation on the one side it was said we can know 
nothing except by our sensations and that which we observwwith 
our senses is constantly changing or at any rate may change at any 
moment on the other hand it was said we do know geometrical 
truths and as truly as we know them that they cannot change 
plato was quite alive to the lesson and to the importance of this 
kind of truths in the meno and in the phkdo he refers to them 
as illustrating the nature of the human mind in the repvdtllo and 
the tinubus he again speaks of truths which far transoend anything 


 p xiu no amount of human knowledge con be adequate whidi does 
not solve the phenomena of these absolute certatuties

which the seneea can teach or even adequately exemplify the 
aenses be argues in the theateius cannot give us the knowledge 
whilch we have the source of it must therefore be in the mind 
itself in the idecu which it possesses the impressions of sense 
are constantly varying and incapable of giving any certainty hut 
the ideas on which real truth depends are conbtant and invariable 
and the certainty which arises from these is firm and indestructible 
ideas are the permanent perfict objects with which the mind 
deals when it contemplates necessary and eteinai truths they 
belong to a region superior to the material world the world of 
sense they are the objects which make up the furniture of the 
intelligible world with which the reason deals as the senses 
deal each with its appropriate sensation 

but it will naturally be asked what is the relation of ideas to 
the objects of sense some connexion or relation it is plain 
there must be the objects of sense can suggest and can illustrate 
real truths though these truths of geometry cannot be proved 
cannot even be exactly exemplified by drawing diagrams yet 
diagrams are of nse in helping ordinary minds to see the proof 
and to all minds may represent and illustrate it and though our 
conclusions with regard to objects of sense may be insecure and 
imperfect they have some show of truth and therefore soma 
resemblance to truth what does this arise from how is it ex 
plained if there is nq truth except concerning ideas 

to this the flatonist replied that the phenomena which present 
themselves to the sense partake in a certain manner of ideas and 
thus include so much of the nature of ideab that they include also 
an element of truth the geometrical diagram of triangles and 
squares which is drawn in the sand of the floor of the gymnasium 
 partakes of the nature of the true ideal triangles and squares so 
that it presents an imitation and suggestion of the truths which are 
trad of them the real triangles and squares are in the mind 
they are iis we have said objects not in the visible but in the 
intelligible world but the visible triangles and squares make 
us call to mind the intelligibly and thus the objects of sense 
suggest and in a wa exemplify the eternal truths 

this conceive to be the simplest and directest ground of hro 
primary ports of the theory of ideas — the eternal ideas consti 
tuting an intelligible world and the participation in these ideal 
 ascribed to the objects of the world of sente and it is plain that 
bo far the theory meets what conceive was its primary purpose 
it answers the questions how can we have certain knowledge 
though we cannot get it flrom sense and how can we have 



of the platonic theory op ideas 

knowledge at least apparent though imperfeot about the world of 
sense 

but is this the ground on whioh plato himsdf rests the truth of 
his theory of ideas as i hare said hare no doubt that these 
were the questions which suggested the theory and it is perpetu 
idly applied in such a manner as to show that it was held by plato 
in this sense but his applications of the theory refer rery often 
to another part of it — to the idsas not of triangles and squares 
of space and its affections but to the ideas of helattonsas the 
relations of like and unlike greater and less or to things quite 
different from the things of which geometry treats for instance to 
tables and chairs and other matters with regard to which no 
demonstration is possible and no general truth still less necessaiy 
and eternal truth capable of being asserted 

 conceive that the theory of ideas thus asserted and thus sup 
ported stands upon very much weaker ground than it does when 
it is asserted concerning the objects of thought abont which neces 
sary and demonstrable truths ore attainable and in order to 
devise arguments againsc this part of the theory and to trace 
the contradictions to which it leads we have no occasion to task 
our own ingenuity we find it done to our hands not only lu 
aristotle the open opponent of the theory of ideas but in works 
which stand among the platonic dialogues themselves and wish 
especially to point out some of the arguments against the ideal 
theory which are given in one of the most noted of the platonic 
dialogues the parmenidei 

the parmenides contains a narrative of a dialogue held between 
parmenides and zeno the eleatic philosophers on the one side 
and socrates along with several other persons on the other it 
moy be regarded as divided into two main portions the first in 
which the theory of ideas is attacked by parmenides and defended 
by socrates the second in whioh parmenides discusses at length 
the eleatic doctrine that all things are one it is the former part 
the dtsoussioo of the theory of ideas to which especially wish to 
direct attention at present and in the first place to that extension 
of the theory of ideas to things of which no general truth is 
possible such as i have mendoned tables and chatrs plato often 
¦peeks of a table by way of example os a thing of whioh them 
must be an idea not taken from any special table or assemblkgo 
of tables but an ideal table such that all tables are tables 
participating in the nature of this idea now the question is 
whether there is any force or indeed any sense in this assumpdou 
and this quesdon is diseussed in the pormeaidet socrates is there 



o philosophy op discovert 

represented as verj confident in the existence of ideas of the high 
est and largest kind the just the fair the good and the like 
parmenides asks him how far he follows his theory is there he 
asks an idea of man which is distinct from us men an idea of 
fire of water “ in truth’ replies socrates i hare often hesi 
tated parmenides about these whether wo are to allow such 
ideas’ when plato had proceeded to teach that there is an idea 
of a table of course he could nt reject such ideas as man and 
fire and water parmenides proceeding in the same line pushes 
him further still do you doubt” says he whether there are 
ideas of things apparently worthless and vile is there an idea of 
a hair of mud of filth socrates has not the courage to 
accept such an extension of the theory he says by no means 
these are not ideas these are nothing more than just what we 
sec them have often been perplexed what to think on this sub 
ject but after standing to this a while i have fled the thought 
for fear of falling into an unfathomable abyss of absurdities” on 
this parmenides rebukes him for his want of consistoney ah 
socrates” he says ”you are yet young dnd philosophy has not yet 
taken possession of you as i think she will one day do — when yon 
will have learned to find nothing despicable iu any of these things 
but now your youth inclines you to regard the opinions of men” 
it is indeed plain that if we are to assume an idea of a chair or a 
table we can find no boundary line which will exclude ideas of 
everything for which we have a name however worthless or offen 
sive and this is an argument against the assumption of mch 
ideas which will convince most persons ofuhe groundlcsmness of 
the assumption — the more so fk for the assumption of such ideas 
it does not appear that plato offeis any argument whatever nor 
does this assumption solve any problem or remove any difficulty’ 
parmenides then had reason to say that consistency required 
socraeb if he assumed any such ideas to assume all a nd con 
ceive his reply to be to this effect and to bo thus a reducho ad 
absurdum of the theory of ideas in this sense according to the 
opinions of those who see in the parmenides an exposition of pla 
tonic doctrines believe tliat parmenides is conceived in this 
passage to suggest to sociates what is necessary for the comple 
tion of the theory of ideas but upon either supposition wish

of the platonic theouy of ideas 

especiallj to draw the attention of niy renders to the position ot 
anperioritj in the dialogue in which parmenides is here placed 
with regard to socrates 

parmenides then proceeds to propound to socrates difliculties 
with regard to the ideal theory in another of its aspects — namely 
when it assumes ideas of relations of things and here also wish 
especially to have it considered how far the answers of socrates to 
these objections are really satisfactory and conclusive 

teli roe’ says he § rekker you conceive that there are 
certain ideas and that things partaking of these ideas are called 
by the corresponding names idea of liheneas things partaking 
of which arc called like — of greatness whence they are great 
of beauty whence they are beautiful socrates assents natu 
rally this being the simple and universal statement of the theory 
in this case but then conies one of the real dilhculties uf the 
theory since the special things participate of the general idea 
has each got the whole of the idea which is of course one or 
has each a part of the idea for’ says parmenides cnn there 
be any other way of participation thun these two” sorat€s 
replies by a similitude the idea though one may be wholly in 
each object as the day one and the same is wholly in each place” 
the physical illustration parmenides damages by making it more 
physical still “you are ingenious socrates” he says § “in 
making the same thing be in many places at the same time if you 
had a number of persons wrapped up in a sail or web wmiild you 
say that each of them had the whole of it is not the case similar 
socrates cannot deny that it is but in this case each person has 
only a part of the whole and thus your ideas are partible to 
this socrates is represented as assenting in the briefest possible 
phrase and thus here again as i conceive parmenides retains hi 
buperiority over socrates in the dialogue 

there are many other arguments urged against the ideal laieory 
by parmenides the next is consequence of this artibility of 
ideas thus supposed to be proved and is ingenious enough it is this 

“ if the idea of greatness distributed among things that are 
great so that each has a part of it each separate thing will be 
great in virtue of a part of greatness which is less than greatness 
itself is not this absurd socrates submissively allows that it is 

anb the same argument is applied in the case of the idea of 
equality 

“ if each of several things have a part of the idea of equality it 
will be equal to something in virtue of something which is leas 
than equality 



 philosophy op discovery 

afid in the fame way with regard to the idea of smallnesa 

if each thing be amall by having a part of the idea of smallneff 
smallneee itself will be greater than the small thing since that is 
a part of itself’ 

these ingenions results of the partibility of ideas remind ns of 
the ingenuity shown in the greek geometry especially the fifth 
book of euclid they are represented as not resisted by socrates 
§ in what way socrates fan things participate in idais if 
they cannot do so either integrally or partibly ” by my troth” 
says socrates it does not seem easy to toll” parmenides who 
completely takes the conduct of the dialogue then turns to another 
part of the sabject and propounds other arguments what do 
yon say to this he asks 

 there is an ideal greatness and there are many things separate 
from it and great by virtue of it but now if you look at great 
ness and the great things together since they are all great they 
must be great in virtue of some higher idea of greatness which 
includes both and thus you have a second idea of greatness and 
in like manner you will have a third and so on indefinitely” 

this also as an argument against the separate existence of ideas 
socrates is represented as unable to answer he replies inter 
rogatively 

 why parmenides is not each of these ideas a thought which 
by its nature cannot exist in anything except in the mind in 
that case your consequences would not follow” 

this is an answer which changes the cnurse of the reasoning but 
still not much to the advantage of the ideth theory parmenides 
is still ready with very perplexing arguments § 

the ideas then” he says are thoughts they mast be 
thoughts of something they are thoughts of something then 
which exists in all the special things some one thing which the 
tbodht perceives in all the special things and this one thought 
thus involveq in all is the idea but then if the special things as 
you say participate in the idea they participate in the thought 
and thus all objects are made up qf thonghts and all things think 
or else there are thoughts in things which do not think” 

this argument drives socrates from the position that ideas arc 
thoughts and he moves to another that they are paradigms 
exemplars of the qualities of things to which the things them 
•elves are like and their being thus like is their partieipattng in 
the idea but here too he has no better snooeti parmeiiidea 
argues thus 

if the object be like the idea the idea must be bke the 



op the platonic theory op ideas ii 

object and since the object and the idea are like they mnsl 
according to your doctrine participate in the idea of likeness 
and thus you have one idea participating in another idea and so 
on in infijnituni socrates is obliged to allow that this demolishes 
the notion of objects partaking in their ideas by likeness and that 
he must seek some other way ‘you see then socrates’ says 
parmenides what difficulties follow if any one asserts the inde 
pendeut existence of ideas’ socrates allows that this is true 
 and yet” says parmenides you do not half perceive the dif 
ficulties which follow from this doctrine of ideas socrates ex 
presses a wish to know to what parmenides refers and the aged sage 
replies by explaining that if ideas exist independently of us we 
can never know anything about them and that even the gods 
could not know anything about man this argument though 
somewhat obscure is evidently stated with perfect earnestness 
and socrates is represented as giving his assent to it and yet” 
says parmenides end of § “if any one gives up entirely the 
doctrine of ideas how is any reasoning possible 

all the way through this discussion parmenides appears as vastly 
superior to socrates as seeing completely the tendency of every 
line of reasoning while socrates is driven blindly from one posihon 
to another and as kindly and graciously advising a young man 
respecting the proper aims of his philosophical career as well as 
clearly pointing out the consequences of bis assumptions nothing 
can be more complete than the higher position assigned to par 
menides in the dialogue 

this has not been sverlooked by the editors and commentators 
of plato to take for example one of the latest in steinhart’s 
introduction to hieronymus miillers translation of parmenidti 
leipxig p g he says “ it strikes us at first as strange 
that plato here seems to come forward as the assailant of his own 
doctrine of ideas for the difficulties which he makes parmenides 
propound against that doctrine are by no means sophistical or 
superficial but substantial and to the point moreover there is 
among all these objections vjhlch are partly derived from the 
megarios scarce one which does not appear again in the penetrating 
and comprehensive argumentations of aristotle against the flatonio 
doctrine of ideas 

of oonrse both this writsr and other commentators on plato 
offisr something as a solution of this difficulty but though these 
explanations are subtle and ingenious they appear to leave do 
satisfactory or permanent impression on the mind must avow 
that to me they appear insuient and empty and i eannot help 



 


philosopht of discovery 


belieting that the solution is of a more simple and direct kind it 
may seem bold to maintain an opinion different from that of so 
many eminent scholars but i think that the solution which offer 
will derive confirmation faam a consideration of the whole dialogue 
and therefore shall venture to propound it in a distinct and 
positive form it is tliis 

i conceive that the parmenides is not a platonic dialogue at all 
but antiplatonic or more properly eleatic written not by 
plato in order to explain and prove his theory of ideas but by 
some one probably an admirer of parmenides and zeno in order 
to show how strong were his master’s arguments agaiiiht the 
riatoiiists and how weak their objections to te eleatic doctrine 

 conceive that this view throws an especial light on every part 
of the dialogue as a brief survey of it will show pannetiides 
and zeno come to athens to the panathenaic festival parmenides 
already an old man with a silver head dignified and benevolent in 
his appearance looking live and sixty years old zeno about forty 
•tall and handsome they are the guests of pythodorus outside 
the wall in the ceramicus and there they are visited by socrates 
then young and others who wish to hear the written discourses of 
zeno these discourses are explanations of the philosophy of 
parmenides which he had delivered in verse 

socrates is represented as showing from the first a disposition 
to criticize zeno’s disertation very closely and without ny prelude 
or preparation he applies the doctrine of ideas to refute the eleatic 
doctrine that all things are one § when he had heard to 
the end he bogged to have the first propositmn of the first book 
read again and then “how is it o zeno that you say that 
if the things which exist are many and not one they must be at 
the same time like and unlike is this your argument or do i 
misunderstand you” “no” says zeno “you understand quite 
 rightlja” socrates then turns to parmenides and says somewhat 
rudely as it stems “ zeno is a great friend of yours parmenides 
he shows his friendship not only in other ways but plso in what he 
writes for he says the same things which you say though ho 
pretends that he does not you sajin your poems that all things 
are one and givp striking proofs he says that existences are not 
many and he gies many and good proofs you seem to soar above 
us but you do not really differ” zeno takes this sally good 
humouredly and tells him that he pursues the scent with the keen 
ness of a laconian hound but” says he § “ there really is 
less of ostentation in my writing than you think my eesay was 
jnerely written ae a defence of parmenides long ago when i wa 



of the platonic theory of ideas 

young and la not a piece of display composed now that i am 
older and it was stolen from me by some one so that i had no 
choice about publishing it 

here we have as i conceive socrateil already represented as 
placed in a disadvantageous position by his abruptness rude 
allusions and reiidiness to put bad interpretations on what is done 
for this zenos gentle pleasantry is a rebuke socrates however 
forthwith rushes into the argument arguing as liave said for 
his owu theory 

 tell me” ho says mo you not think tliere is an idea of like 
ness and an idea of unlikeness and that everything partakes of 
these ideas the things wlpch partake of unlikencss arc unlike 
if ail things partake of both ideas they are both like and unlike 
and where is the wonder § if you could show that likeness 
itself was unlikeness it would be a prodigy but if things which 
partake of these opposites have both the opposite qualities it 
appears to me zeno to involve no absurdity 

“ so if oneness itself were to he shown to be maniness ’ i hope 
i may use this word rather than multiplicity should be sur 
prised but if any one say that i am at the same time one and many 
where is the wonder for i partake of maniness my right side is 
different from my left side my upper from my under parts but 
also partake of oneness for am here one of us seven so that 
both are true and so if any one say that stocks and stones and 
the like are both one and manynot saying that oneness is 
maniness nor maniness oneness he says nothing wonderful he 
says what all will alloi § if then as i said before any one 
should take separately the ideas or essence of things as likeness 
and unlikeness maniness and oneness rest and motion and the 
like and then should show that these can mix and separate again 

i should be wonderfully surpried o zeno for i reckon that 
have tolerably well made myself master of these sabjecp jt 
should be much more surprised if any one could howne this con 
tradiction involved in the ideas themselves in the object of the 
reason as well os in visible objects’ 

it may be remarked that sderates delivers all this argumenta 
tion with the repetitions which it involves and the vehemence of 


 i am aware that this translation 
is different from the common trans 
latlon tt appears to me to be con 
sistent with the habit of the greek 
lenikuage it slightly leans in favour 


of my view but i do not conceive 
that the argument would he percep 
tibly weaker if common inter 
pretation were adopted 




 philosophy of disooveut 

its maoner without waiting for a reply to any of his interrogations 
instead of making overy step the result of a concession of his 
opponent as is the case in the dialogues where he is represented 
as triumphant every isiader of plato will recollect also that in 
those dialogues the triuniph of temper on the part of socrates ia 
repi esented as still more remarkable than the triumph of argument 
no tehemence or rudeness on the part of his adversaries prevents 
his calmly following his reasoning aid he parries coarseness by 
compliment now in this dialogue it is remarkable that this kind 
of triumph is given to the adversaries of socrates when socrates 
had thus delivered himself’ says pythodorus the narrator of the 
conversation we thought that parmenides and zeno would both 
be augiy but it was not so they bestowed entire attention 
upon him and often looked at each other and smiled as in 
admiration of socrates and when he had ended parmenides 
said o socrates what an admirable person you are for the 
earnestness with which you reason i tell me then do you then 
believe the doctrine to which you have been referring— that there 
are certain ideas existing independent of things and that there 
are separate from the ideas things which partake of them 
and do jou think that there is au idea of likeness besides the 
likeness which we have and n oneness and a maniiiesv and the 
like and an idea of tlie light and the good and the fair and 
of other such qualities’’ socrates says that he does hold this 
parmenides then asks him how far he carries this doctrine of 
ideas and propounds to him the difficulties which i have already 
stated and when socrates is unable to answer him lets him off 
in the kind but patronizing way which i have already described 

to me comparing this with the intellectual and moral attitude 
of socrates in the most dramatic of the other platonic dialogues 
ft is inconceivable that this representation of socrates shonld be 
plato’s it is just what zeno would have written if he had 
wished to bestow upon his master parmenides the calm dignity and 
irresistible argument which plato assigns to socrates and this 
character is kept up to the end of the dialogue when socrates 
§ has acknowledged that he isat loss which way to turn for 
his philosophy parmenides undertakes though with kind words 
to explain to him by what fundamental error in the course of hia 
speculative habits he has been misled he says ‘you try to 
make a complete theory of ideas before you have gone through 
a proper iatellectual discipline the impulse which urges yon to 
such speculations is admirable— is divine but you must elsroiso 
yourself in reasoning which many think triflidg while you are yet 



of the platonic theory of ideas 

young if you do not the truth will elude your grasp’ socrates 
asks submissively what is the course of such discipline parmenides 
replies the course pointed out by zeno as you have heard” 
and then gives him some instructions in manner he is to teat 
any proposed theory socrates is frightened at the laboriousness 
and obscurity of the process he says you tell me parmenides 
of an overwhelming course of study and do not well comprehend 
it give me an example of such an examination of a theory’’ 
it is too great a labour” says he for one so old as am 
well then you zeno” says socrates will yon not give us such 
an example zeno answers smiling that tht bad better get it 
from parmenides himself and joins iu the petition of socrates 
to him that he will instruct them all the company unite in the 
request parmenides compares himself to an aged racehorse 
brought to the course after long disuse and trembling ut the risk 
but finally consents and as an example of a theory to be 
examined takes his own doctrine that ah things are one 
carrying on the dialogue thenceforth not with socrates but with 
aristoteles not the stagirite but afterwards one of the thirty 
whom he chooses as a younger and more manageable respondent 

the discussion of this doctrine is of a very subtle kind and 
it would be difficult to make it intelligitile to a modern reader 
nor is it necessary for my purpose to attempt to do so it is plain 
that the discussion is intended seriously as an example of true 
philosophy and each step of the process is represented as irresis 
tible the respondent has nothing to say but yps of no how 
 certainly jt doetjitpear jt does not appear • the discus 
sion is carried to a much greater length than all the rest of the 
dialogue and the result of the reasoning is summed up by par 
menidea thus ”if one exist it is nothing whether one exist 
or do not exist both it and other things both with regard to 
themselves and to each other ah and everyway are and arf not 
appear and appear not” and tliis also is fully assorted to and 
so the dialogue ends 

 sliall not pretend to explain the doctrines there examined 
that one exists or one does lot exist nor to trace their con 
leqnencm bat these were formulm as familiaer in tha eleatlo 
school as ideas in the platonic and were undoubtedly regarded 
by the megariq contemporaries of plato as quite worthy of being 
discussed after tbe theory of ideas had been overjitrown this 
aecordtny appears to be the purport of the dialogue an it is 
ponued os we see without any bitterness toward sooratea or his 
disciples i but with a persuasion that they were poor philosophers 
conceited talkers and weak disputants

picture in the opening of the republic he is from clazomenin 
and tells us that hia fellow citizetisr are great losers of philosophy 
a trait of their character which does not appear elsewhere even 
the brothers glaucon and adlmantus are not the two brothers 
of plato who conduct the dialogue in the later books of the 
republic so at least ast argues who holds the genuineness of the 
dialogue this glaucon and adimantus are most wantonly in 
troduced for the sole office they have is to say that they have 
a halfbrother antiphon by a second marriage of their mother 
no such half bi other of plato and no such marriage of his mother 
are noticed in other remains of antiquity antiphon is represented 
as having been the friend of pythodoius who was the host of 
fannenidcs and zeno as we have seen and antiphon having 
often heard from pythodoms the account of the conversation of 
his guests with socrates retained it in his memory or in his 
tablets so as to be able to give the full report of it which we have 
in the dialogue parmenides to me all this looks like a clumsy 
imitation of the introductions to the platonic dialogues 

i say nothing of the chronological cbihculties which arise from 
bringing parmerldea and socrates together though they are 
considerable for they have been explained more or less satisfac

a survey by plato of tbo state of the sciences as exiating in 
hh tinwe maybe recorded as hardly less iiitcrestinje than francis 
bacon’s llcyiew of the condition of the sciences of kis time oon 
tained in the advancement of learning such a surfej we have in 
the seventh book of plato’s republic i and it wi’’ be instructive to 
examine what the sciences then were and what plato aspired to 
have them become aiding ourselves by the light afforded by the 
subsequent hibtory of science 

in the first place it is interestiilg to note in the two writers 
plato and bacon the same deep conviction that the large and 
profound philosophy which they iecommended had not in their 
judgment been pursued in an adequate and worthy manner by 
those who had pursued it at the reader of bacon will 
recollect the passage in tbeomm orgapon lib aphorism 
where he speaks with indignatioir of the way in which philosophy 
had been degraded an pervcrtecjl by being applied as a mere in 
stniment of utility or of eorlv education so that the great 
mother of ths sciences is thrust down with indignity to the offices 
of a handmaid is made to m mister to the labours of medicine o 
mathematics or again to give the first preparatory tinge the

 obijmlkw bttsif tod fearljr i set about my explanation of 
my assftl that philoeopben ought to rule the world for i 
begin by aang tbit thc state mast begin to treat the study of 
philosophy in a way opposite to that uow practised now those 
who meddle at all th this study are put upon it when they are 
children between the lessons whia they receive in the farmyard 
and in the shop and as soon as tiey have been introduced to the 
hardest part of the subjsct are taken off from it even those who 
get the most of philosophy by the hardest part i mean the 
discussion of prinoiplesdialectic and m their succeeding years 
if they are willing to listen to a few lectures of those who make 
philosophy their business they think they have done great things 
as if it were something foreign to the business of lifo and as 
they advance towards old age with a very few exceptions philosophy 
in them is extingiiished extinguished far moie completely than the 
ueraclitean sun fr theirs is not lighted up again as that is every 
morning alluding to the opinion which was propounded by way of 
carrying the doctrine of the unfixiiy of sensible objects to an ex 
treme that the sun is extinguished every night and lighted again 
in the morning in opposldan to this practice plato holds that 
philosophy should be the especial employment of mens minds when 
their bodily strength fails 

what plato means by dialectic which he in the next book 
calls the bighedt part of philosopiy and which is think what he 
here means by the hardest part of philosophy may hereafter 
considei but at present wish to pass is review the sciences 
which he speaks of as leading the uay to that highest study these 
sciences are arithmetic plane ipeometry solid geometry as 
tronomy and harmonii s 

 the view in which plato here iegard the sciences is as the 
instruments of that culture of the philosopbictl spirit which is to 
make the philosopher tie fit and nataral ruler of the perfect state 
—the platonic polity it is held thafi to answer this pnrpose the 
mind must be iustruotedin something more stable than the know 
ledge supplied by the senses — a knoivledge of objects which are 
constantly changing and which therefove can be no real permanent 
knowledge but only opinion the rwl and permanent know 
ledge which we thus require is to be fouiid in certain sciences 
which deal with trutke nectccary and unjbersal as we should now

this is the object of the sciences of which piafjo epehks and 
henoewhen he introduces arithmetic es thnt of the seiencos which 
are to be employed in this mental discipline he adds vn § that 
it must be not mere common arithmetic but science which lends 
to speculatwe truths seen by intuition not ah arithmetie which 
is studied for the sake of buying taod selling as among tradesmeo 
and shopkeepers but for the sake of pure and real scieifde 

 shall not dwell upon the details with which he illnstlutes this 
tiew but proceed to the other sciences which he mentions 

geometry is then spokca of as obrionsly the nert science in 
order and it is asserted that it really does answer the required 
condition of drawing the mind from risible mutable phenomena to 
a permanent reality geometers indeed speak of their risible dia 
grams as if their problems were certain practical processes to 
erect a perpendicular to construct a square and the like but 
this language though necessary it really absurd the dgures are 
mere aids to their reasonings their knowledge is really a know 
ledge not of risible objects but of permanent realities and thu 
geometry is one of the helps by which the mind may be drawn to 
truth by which the philosophical spirit my be formed which 
looks upwards instead of downwards 

astronomy is suggested as the science next in order hut socrates 
the leader of the dialogue remarks that there is an intermediate 
se ence first to be considered geometry treats of plane figures 
astronomy treats of sofida in motion that is of spheres in motion 
for the astronomy of plato’s time wag mainly the doctrine of 
 the sphere but before treating of solids in motion we mnst 
have a science which treats of souds simply after taking space of 
two dimensions we must take apace of three dimensions length 
breadth and depth as in cubes and the like but such a science

deficient this branch of knowledge to use the expression employed 
by bacon on the like occasions in his review plato goes on to 
say that the cultivators of such a science have not received due en 
couragement and that though scorned and starved by the public 
and not recommended by any obvious utility it has still made great 
progress in virtue of its own attractiveness 

in fact researches in solid geometry had been pursued with 
great zeal by plato and his friends and with remaikable success 
the five regular solids the tetrahedron or pyramid cube octa 
hediod dodecahedron and icosahedron had been discovered and 
the curious theorem th it of regular solids there can be fust so 
many these and no others was known the doctrine of these 
solids was already applied in a way fanciful and arbitrary no 
doubt but ingenious and lively to the theory of the universe in 
the timaus the elements have these forms assigned to them re 
spectively earth has the cube fire has the pyramid water has 
the octahedron air has the icosahedron and the dodecahedron 
is tlie plan of the universe itself this application of the doctrine 
of the regular solids shows that the knowledge of those figures 
was already established and that plato had a right to speak of 
solid geometry as a real acd interesting science and that this 
subject was so recondite and profound — that these five regular 
solids had so little application in the geometry which has a bearing 
on man ordinary thoughts and actions — made it all the more 
natural for plato to suppose that these solids had a bearing on the 
constitution of the universe and we shall find that such a belief 
in later times found a ready acceptance in the minds of mathemati 
cians who followed in the platonic line of speculation 

plato next proceeds to consider astronomy and here we have 
can amusing touch of philosophical drama glaucon the hearer and 
pupil in the dialogue is desirous of showing that he has profited 
by wat his instructor had said about the real uses of science he 
sys astronomy is a very good branch of education it is such a 
yevj useful science for seamen and husbandmen and the like 
socrates says with a smile as w may suppose you are very 
amusing with your zeal for utility suppose you are afirald of 
being condemned by the good people of athens for diffusing use 
less knowledge a little afterwards glaucon tries to do better 
but still with no great soeoess he says you blamed me for 
praring astronomy awkwardly but now i will fdllow your lead 
astronomy is one of the sciences which you require because it 
makes mens minds look upwards and study things above any one

except me — i oannot eee it glauoon is surprised but socrates 
gdes on “your notice of ‘the study of things aboye is certainly 
a very magnidcent one you seem to think that if a roan bends hia 
head back and looks at the ceiling he looka upwards with his 
mind as well as his eyes you may be right and may be wrong 
but i liave no notion of any science which makes the mind look 
upwards except a science which is abput the permanent and the 
inr ibible it makes no difference as to that matter whether a man 
gapes and looks up or shuts bis mouth ami looks down if a roan 
merely look up and stare at sensible objects his mjnd does not look 
upwards even if he wore to pursue his studies swimming on his back 
in the sea’ 

the astronomy then which merely locks at phenomena does 
not satisfy plato he wants something more what is it as 
glaucon very naturally asks 

plato then describes astrouoroy as a real science h the 
variegated adornments which appear in the sky the risible lomina 
ries we must judge to be the most beautiful and the most perfect 
things of their kind but since they are mere visible bgures we 
must suppose them to be far inferior to the true objects namely 
those spheres which with their real proportions of quicknese and 
slowness their real number their real figures revolve and carry 
luminaries in their revolutions these objects are to be apprehend 
ed by reason and mental conception not by vision and he then 
goes on to say tliat the vavied figures which the skies present to the 
eye are to be used as diagram to assist the study of that higher 
truth just as if any ofie were to study geometry by means of beau 
tiful diagrams constructed by dsdalus or any other consummate 
artist 

here then plato points to a kind of astronomical science whici 
gqea beyond the mere arrangement of phenomena an astronomy 
which it would seem did not exist at the time when he wrofe it 
is natural to inquire whether we cau determine mlre precisely 
what kind of astronomical science he meant and whether euch 
fioience has been brought into existence since his time 

hp gives us soma further features of the philosopldcal astronomy 
wbick he requires as you do not expect tof find in the most 
exquisite geometrical diagrams the true evidence of quantities beinp 
equal or double or in any other relation so the true ostropomet 
wl not think that the proportion of the day to the mopthi or the 
month to the year and the like are real and immutable things 
iu will seek a deeper truth than ese we must treat astronomy 
like geometry as a series of problems suggested by vleltde things 



 


appendix b 


we muit apply the intelligent portion of our mind to the sub 
ject 

here we really come in view of a class of problems which astro 
nomical speculators at oeftain periods have proposed to thcmsdres 
what is the real ground of the proportion of the day to the month 
and of the mohtb to the year do not know that any writer of 
great name has tried to determine but to ask the reason of these 
proportions namely that of the revolution of the earth on its axis 
of the moon in its orbit and of the earth in its orbit are questions 
just of the same kind as to ask the reason of the proportion of 
the rerolutions of the planets in their orbits and of the proportion 
of the orbits themselves now who has attempted to assign such 
reasons 

of coarse we shall answer kepler not so much in the laws of 
the planetary motions which bear his name as in the law which 
at an earlier period he thought he had discovered determining the 
proportion of the distances of the several planets from the sun 
an curiously enough this solution of a problem which we may 
conceive plato to have had in his mind kepler gave by means of 
the five regular solids which plato had brought into notice and 
had employed in his theory of the universe given in the tvnkeiff 

kepler’s speculations on the subject just mentioned were given to 
the world in the mysterium cosmographicum published in in 
his preface he says ln the beginning of the year brooded 
with the whole energy of my mind on the subject of the copernioan 
system there were three things in particular of which pertina 
ciously sought the causes why they are not ofiier than they are the 
number the size and the motion of the orbits we see how 
strongly ho had his mind impressed with the same thought which 
plato had so confidently uttered that there must be some reason 
for those proportions in the scheme of the universe which appear 
caaualand vague he as confident at this period that he had 
solved two oi the three questions which haunted him that he 
oonld account for the number and the sise of the planetary orbits 
his acootidt was given in this waytbe orbit of the earth is a 
circle round the sphere to whieh thie circle belongs deaeribsr a 
dodecahedron ttkp sphere including this will give the orbit of 
mars bound mars inscribe a tetrahedron the circle incktdidg 
this will be the orbit of jupiter describe a cube round jupiters

it ihll be the orbit of venns inscribe an octahedron in the orbu 
ot venus the circle inscribed in it will be mercury’s orbit this is 



ox platos survey of the sciences 

the reason of the number of the planets and also of the magni 
tudetfof their orbits 

these proportions were only approximations and the role thus 
asserted has been shown to be unfoundodf by the discovery of new 
planets this law of repler has been repudiated by succeeding 
astronomers so far then tlie astronomy which plato reuires 
as a part of true philosophy has not been brought into being but 
are we thence to conclude thatthe demand for such a kind of 
astronomy was a mere platouio imagination — was a mistake 
which more recent and sounder views have corrected we can 
hardly venture to say that for the questions which kepler thus 
asked and which he answered by the assertion of this erroneous 
law are questions of exactly the same kind as those which he asked 
and answered by means of the true laws which still fasten his 
name upon one of the epochs of astronomical history if he was 
wrong in assigning reasons for the number and size of the planetary 
orbits he was right in assigning a reason for the proportion of the 
motions this he did in the harnianice mundi published in 
where he established that the squares of the periodic times of the 
different planets are as the cubes of their mean distances from the 
central sun of this discovery he speaks with a natural exultation 
which succeeding astronomers have thought well founded he 
says what prophesied two and twenty years ago as soon as i 
had discovered the five solids among the heavenly bodies what 
firmly believed before i had seen the harmonics of ptolemy what 
 promised my friends in the title of this book on the perfect harm 
mony of the celestiul ikotions which i named before l was sure of 
my discovery what sixteen years ago i regarded as a thing to be 
sought that for which i joined tycho brahe for which settled in 
prague for which devoted the best part of my life to astronomical 
contemplations at length have brought to light and have recog 
nised its truth beyond my most sanguin expectations’ fiarm 
jhundu lib v • 

thus the platonic notion of an astronomy which deals with 
doctrines of a more exact and determinate kind than the obvious 
relations of phenomena may be found to tend either to error or to 
truth uoh aspirations point equally to the five regular solids 
which kepler imagined as determining the planetary orbits and to 
the laws of kepler in which newton detected the effect of nuiver 
sal gravitation the realities which plato looked for as something 
ineompsrably more real than the visible luminaries are fbund when 
wc find geometrical figures epicycles and eccentrics laws of motion 



 


appendix b 


and laws of force which explain the appearances hia realities are 
theories which account for the phenomena ideas which connect 
the facts 

but is plato right intiolding that such realities as these are 
more real than the phenomena and constitute an astronomy of a 
higlier kind than that of mere appearances to this we shall of 
course reply that theories and facts have each their reality but 
that these are realities of different kinds kepler’s laws are as real 
as day and night tiie force of gravity tending to the sun is as real 
as the sun but not more so true theories and facts are equally 
real for true theories are facts and facts are familiar theories 
astronomy is as plato says a series of problems suggested by visi 
ble things and the thoughts in our own minds which bring the 
solutions of these problems have a reality in the things which sug 
gest them 

but if we try os plato does to separate and oppose to each other 
the astronomy of appearances and the astronomy of theories we 
attempt that which is impossible there arc no phenomena which 
do not exhibit some law no law can lie conceived without pheno 
mena the heavens offer a series of problems but however many 
of these problems we solve there remain still innumerable of them 
unsolved and these unsolved problems have solutions and are not 
different in kind from those of which the extant solution is most 
complete 

ndr can we justly distinguish with plato astronomy into tran 
sient appearances and permanent truths the theories of astro 
nomy are permanent and are manifested in a leries of changes but 
the change is perpetual just because the theory is permanent the 
perpetual change is the permanent fheory the perpetual changes 
in the poiitioiis and movements of the planets for instance manifest 
the permanent machinery the macbpiery of cycles and epicycles as 
plato srould have said as copernicus would have agreed while 
kepler with profound admiration for both would have asserted 
that the motions might be represented by ellipses more exactly if 
not more truly the cyeles and epicycles or the ellipses are as 
real as space and time tn which the footions take place but we 
cannot justly say that space and time and motion are more real than 
the bodies which move in space and time or than the appearances 
which these bodies present 

thus plato with his tendency to exalt ideas above facts to find 
a reality which is more real than phenomena— to take hold of a 
permanent truth which is more true than truths of obiervatioq— 



on platos survey op the sciences 

attempts vhat is impossible he tries to separate the poles of the 
fuqjdaiueqtal antithesis which however antithetical are insepa 
rable 

at the same time we must rllect thai this tendency to find a 
reality which is something beyond appearance a permanence which 
is involved in the changes is the genuine spring of scientifio dis 
covery such a tendency has been the cause of all the astronomical 
science which we iosmess it apsred in plato himself in hippar 
ohns in ptolemy in copernicus and most eminently in kepler and 
in him perhaps in a manner more accordant with platos aspirations 
when he found the five regular solids in the ‘‘universe than when 
he found there the conio sections which determine the form of the 
planetary orbits the pursuit of this tendency has been the source 
of the mighty and successful labours of succeeding astronomers and 
the anticipations of pinto on this head were more true than he him 
self could have conceived 

when the above view of the nature of true astronomy has been 
proposed glaucon says 

 that would be a task much more laborious than the astronomy 
now cultivated” socrates replies believe so and such tasks 

mast be undertaken if our researches are to be good for any 
thing’ 

after astronomy there comes under review another science 
which is treated in the same manner it is presented as one of the 
sciences which deal with real abstract truth and which are there 
fore suited to that development of the phijosophio insight into 
the liigliest truth which is here plato’s ihain object this science 
is harmonies the doctrine of the mathematical relations of musical 
sounds perhaps it may be mre difficult to explain to a general 
audience plato’s views on this than on the previous subjects for 
though harmonics is still acknowledged as a science including th 
mathematical truths to which plato here refers these truths are less 
generally known than those of geometry ot astronomy • pythagoras 
is reported to have been the discoverer of the cardinal proposition in 
this mathematics of music — namely that the musical notes which 
the ear recognizes as having thht definite and hammnious relation 
which we call an octave ajifth a fourth a third have also insome 
way or other the numerical relation of to to i to 
 say ’bome way or other” because the statements of ancient writ 
era on this subject are physically inexact but are right in the essen 
tial point that those simple numerical ratios are oharacteristio of 
the mosimarked harmonic relations the numeeical ratios really 
represent the rate of vibration of the air when thpse harmonics 



appendix b 


 

are produced this perhaps plato did not know but he knew 
or assumed that those numerical ratios were cardinal truths ki har 
monjr and he conceived that the exactness of the ratios rested on 
grounds deeper and more intellectual than any testimony which the 
ear could give tliis is the main point in his mode of applying the 
subject which will be best understood by translating with some 
abridgement what he says socrates proceeds 

§ near the end motion appears in many aspects it 
would take a very wise man to enumerate them all but there are 
two obvious kinds one which appears in astronomy the revolu 
tions of the heavenly bodies and another which is the echo of that 
as the eyes are made for astronomy so are the ears made for the 
motion which produces harmony and thus we have two sister 
sciences as the pythagoreans teach and we assent 

s to avoid unnecessary labour let us first learn what 
they can tell us and see whether anything is to be added to it 
retaining our own view on such subjects namely this — that those 
whose education we are to superintend — real philosopherare 
never to learn any imperfect truths — anything which does not tend 
to that point exact and permanent truth to which all our know 
ledge ought to tend as we said concerning astronomy now 
those who cultivate music take a very different course from this 
you may see them taking immense pains in measuring musical notes 
and intervals by the car as the astronomers measure the heavenly 
motions by the eye 

‘tes says glauoon they apply their ears close to the instrument 
as if they could catch the note by getting iear to it and talk of 
some kind of recurrences some say they can distinguish an 
intervid and that this is the smallest possible interval by which 
others are to be measured while others say that the two notes are 
identical both parties alike judging by the ear not by the 
intelledt 

toa mean says socrates those fipe musicians who torture their 
notes and screw their pegs and pinch their strings and speak of 
the resulting sophds in grand terns of art we will leave them 
and address oorjnipurieb to our other teachers the pythagoreans’ 

the expressions alamt the smttl interval in glaucons eecb 
appear to me to refer to a curious question which we know was 
discussed among the greek mathematicians if we take akeyad 


vpbv kvapyjoviav opav fsra iraiyirwu

instramdnt and ascend from a key note by two oetavet and a third 
say from ai to cg we arrive at the tame nominal note os if we 
ascend four times by fifth ai to jsi hi to bgt to f to c 
hence one party might call this the sanfr note but if the oc 
tate fifths and third be perfectly true intervals the notes 
arrived at in the two ways will not be really the same in the one 
case the note is it x i x in th other § x j x f x which are j 
and if or in the ratio of to this small interval by which 
the two notes really differ the greeks called a cmma and it was 
the smallest musical interval which they recognized plato disdains 
to see anything important in this controversy though the con 
troversy itself really a curious proof of his doctrine that there 
is a mathematical truth in harmony higher than instrumental 
exactness can reach he goes on to say 

the musical teachers are defective in the same way as the 
astronomical they do indeed seek numbers in the harmonic notes 
which the ear perceives but they do not ascend from them to the 
problem what are harmonic numbers and what are not and what 
is the reason of each that says glaucon would be a sub 

lime inquiry 

have we in harmonics as in astronomy anything in the succeed 
ing history of the science which illustrates the tendency of plato 
thoughts and the value of such a tendency 

it is plain that the tendency was of the same nature as that which 
induced kepler to call his work on astronomy harmonice mundi 
and which led to many of the speculations of that work in which 
harmonical are mixecf with geometrical doctrines and if we are 
disposed to judge severely of such speculations as too fanciful for 
sound philosophy we may recollect that newton himself seems to 
have been willing to find an analogy between harmonic number 
and the differeht coloured spaces in the spectrum 

but wiu say frankly that do not believe there reallexlstf 
any harmonical relation in either of these cases nor an the prob 
lem proposed by plato be considered as having been solved sinoe his 
time any forther than the reourgence of vibrations when their ratios 
are so simple may be easily oopoeived as affectfug the ear in a 
peculiar manner the imperfection of musical scales which the 
eomeut indicates has not been removed but we may say that in 
the ease of this problem as in the other ultimate platonic prbbleida 
the duplication of the cube and the quadrature of the drde tho 


is rcnt ac 




appendix b 


 

impossibility of a solation has been already established the prob 
lem of a perfect musical scale is impossible because no power of 
can be equal to a power of and if we further take the multiplier 
 of course it also cannot bring about an exact equality this impos 
sibility of a perfect scale being recognized the practical problem is 
what is the system of temperament which will make the scale best 
suited for nmsical purposes this problem hak been very fully 
discussed by modern writers

cam phil soc may 


fhe survey of the sciences arithmetic plane jometry solid 
 geometry astronomy and harmonic— which is contained in the 
seventh book of the hepiihlic § c — and which has been dis 
cussed in the preceding paper represents them as instruments in 
an education of which the end is something much higher— ros steps 
in a progression which is to go further ‘‘do you not know’ says 
socrates § “that au this is merely a prelude to the etrain 
which we have to learn” and what that strain is he forthwith 
proceeds to indicate “that these sciences do not suffice you 
must be aware for — those who are masters of such sciences— do 
tliey seem to you to be good in dialectic deivol ia€ktikal

“in truths says glaucoh they are not with very few exceptions 
so far as have fallen in with them 

“and yet said persons cannot give and receive a reason 
they cannot attain that knowledge which as we have said men 
ought to have 

here it is evident that “to give and to receive a reason” is a 
phrase employed as coinciding in a general way at least with being 
“good in dialectic and accordingly this is soon after assented in 
another form the verb being now used instead of te adjective 
“it is dialectic discussion t daeyetrdai which executes the

progress it is added of course you call dialectic btaxeicvtku

but these assumptions they cannot to do so is uok in the 

province of eaow science it belongs to a higher scienedt totho

•eieikm of beal existences yon call the man dsalectioal who re 
quires a reason of the essence of each thing 

and as dialectic gives an account of other real existences so 
does it of that most impdtant reality the true guide of life and of 
philosophy the beal good he who cannot follow this through 
all the windings of tlie battle of life knows notjng to any pur 
pose and thus dialeetic is the pinnaele the top stone of the 
edifice of the sciences 

dialectic is here defined or described by plato according to the 
iulteci with which it treats and the object with which it is to be 
pursued but in other parts of the platonic dialognes dialectic 
appears rather to imply a certain method of investigation to de 
scribe the form rather than the matter of discussion and it will 
perhaps be worth while to compare these different accounts of 
dialectic 

phadrue one of the cardinal passages on this point is in the 
phmdrus and may be briefly quoted phecdrus in the dialogue 
which bears his name appears at first as an admirer of lysias a 
celebrated writer of orations the contemporary of plato in order 
to expose uiis writers style of composition as frigid and shallow a 
specimen of it is given and socrates not only criticises this but 
delirers as rival compositious two discourses on the same subject 
of these discourses gisen as the inspiration of the moment the 
first is animated and vigorous the second goes still farther and 
clothes its meaning in a gorgeous dress of poetical and mythical 
images phsedrus acknowledges that bis favourite is ontshone 
and socratee then proceeds to point out that thb real superiority of his 
own discourse condstsltn its having a dialectical structure leath 
its outward aspect of imagery and enthusiasm he says 
bekker it is to be remembered that the subject of all the die 
oourses was love under certain supposed conditions 

thu rest of the performance may be taken as play but there 
were in was thus thrown out by a random impulse two 
features of whieb if any one could reduce the effect to an art 
it would be a rmy agreeable and usqfhl task 

 what aie they phiedroi asks 

the ftpit place socrates replies the taking a connected view 
of thfi scattered elements of a snljeot so as to bring them into one

idea and thus to a definition of the subject so as to make it 
clear what we are speaking of as was then done in regard to xoee 

a definition was given of it what it iss whether the definition 
was good or bad at any rate there was a dcanition and hence in 
what followed we were able to say what was clear and consbtent 
with itself 

 and what pheedras asks was the other feature 

the dividing the subject intodiinds or elements according to 
the nature of the thing itself — not breaking its natural mem 
bers like a bad carver who cannot hit tlie joint bo the two dis 
courses which wo have delivered took the irrational part of the 
mind as their common subject and as the body has two different 
sides the right and the left with the same names for its parts so 
the two discourses took the irrational portion of man and the one 
took the lefthand portion and divided this again and again sub 
divided it till among the sutidi visions it found a lefthanded kind 
of love of which nothing but ill was to be said hile the dis 
course that followed out the righthand side of phrenzy the 
irrational portion of mans nature was led to something which 
bore the name of aove like the other but which is divine and was 
praised as the source of the greatest blesing’ 

now socrates goes on to say am a great admirer of these 
processes of division and comprehension by which i endeavour to 
speak and to think correctly and if x can find any one who is 
able to see clearly what is by nature reducible to one and mani 
fested in many elements follow his footsteps as a divine guide 
those who can do this call — whether rightly or not ood knows 
—but i have hitherto been in the habit of calling them dialechcal 
men 

it is of no consequence to our present purpose whether either of 
the discourses of socrates in the phedrus or the two together as 
is here assumed do contain a just division and subdivision of that 
part of the human soul which is distinguishable fromlreason and 
do thus exhibit in its trus relations the affection of lore it is 
evident that division and subdivjsion of this kind is here presented 
as in platos opinioir a most valuable inethod and those who 
could successfully practise this inethod are those whom he admires 
as dialectical men this is here his ditdechc 

thitus we are naturally led to ask whether this method of 
dividing a subject as the best way of examining t be lo any other 
part of the platonic dialogues more fully explained than it is in 
the phasdros whether any rules are given for this vm of 
dialectic 



 


appendix bb 


to this we may reply that in the dialogue eniitled the sophies 
a method of dividing a subject in order to examine it is explajned 
and exemplified with extraordinary copiousns and ingenuity 
the object proposed iif that dialogue is to define what a sophist 
is and with that view the principal speaker who is represented 
as an kleatic stranger begins by first exemplifying what is his 
method of framing a definition and by applying it to define an 
angler the course fallowed thongh it now reads like a burlesque 
of philosophical methods appears to have been at that time a bona 
fide attempt to be philosophical and methodical it proceeds thus 

have to inquire coiirerning angling is it an art it is 
now whnt hind of art all art is an art of making or an art of 
gettings poietie or icteiic it is ktetio now the art of getting 
is the art of getting by exchange or by capture metahletic or 
chirotic getting by capture is by contest or by chase agonistic 
or thereutic getting by chase is a chase of lifeless or of living 
things tho first has no name the sec‘ond is zooihcric the chase 
of living things is the chase of land animals or of water animals 
pezotherie or enygrotheric chase of water animals is of birds 
or of fish omithothereutic and ijalieutic chase offish is by 
inclosing or by striking them hercotheric or plectie wo strike 
them by day with pointed instruments or by night using torches 
hence the division aikhistreutic and pyreuiic of ankistreutic one 
kind consists in spearing the fish downwards from above tho other 
in twitching them upvards from below these two arts are wo 
dontic and aspalieutic and thus we have what we sought the 
notion and the description of angling namely that it is a itetic 
chirotic thereutic zootheric enygrotheric halieutic pleotio 
ankistreutic aspalieutic art’ 

h several other examples are given of this ingenious mode of defini 
tion but they are all introduced with reference to the definition of 
the sophist and it will further illustrate this method to show 
how according to it the sophist is related to the angler 

the sophistical art is an art of getting by capture living things 
namely men it is thus a ktetic qhirotic thereutic art and so far 
agrees with that of the angler but here the two arts diverge 
since thatof the sophist is pexothcric that of the angler enygro 
theric to determine the sophist still more exactly observe that 
the chase of landaninmls is either of tame anmaineluding man 
or of wild animals jlemerotheric and agriotherie tlie chase of 
tame animals is either by violence as kidnapping tyranny and war 
in general or by persuasion as by the arts of speech that is it 
is siaiolheric or pithanurgie the art of persiiasidn isa private or 



on platos notion of dialectic 

a public proceeding idiothereutic or demosiothereutic the art of 
private persuasion is accompanied with the giving of presents as 
lovers do or with the receiving of pay thus it is doropkoric or 
misthamiutic to receive pay as the rcilblt of persuasion is the 
course cither of those who merely earn tiieir bread by snppling 
pleasure namely flatterprs whose art is ifedyniic or of those who 
profess for pay to teach virtue and who are they plainly the 
sophists and tlius sophistic i that kind of ictelic chirotic 
therrntic zootherio pezotiioric hemerotheric pithannrgic idio 
thereutic mitharnoutic art which professes to teach virtue and 
takes money on that account 

the same process is pursued aong several other lines of inquiry 
and at the end of each of them the sophist is detected involved in 
a number of somewhat obnoxious characteristics this process of 
division it will be observed is at every step bifurcate or as it is 
culled dichotomous applied as u is in these examples it is rather 
the vehicle of satire than of philosophy yet i have no doubt that 
this bifurcate method was admired by some of the philosophers of 
plato’s time as a clever and effective philosophical invention we 
may the more readily believe this inasmuch as one of the most acute 
persons of our own time who has come nearer than any other to 
the ancient heads of sects in the submission with which his followers 
have accepted his doctrines inis taken up this diehotonions method 
and praised it as the only philosophical mode of dividing a sub 
ject i refer to mr lercniy benthani’s published 

originally in isld in which this exhaustive bifurcate method as he 
calls it was applied t classify sciences and arts with a view to a 
scheme of education hov exactly the method as recommended by 
him agrees with the method illustrated in tho sophist an examina 
tion of any of his examples will show thus to take mineralogy ah 
an example according to benihani ontology is coenoscopic or 
idioscopic the idioscopic is somatoscopic or piicumatoscopiif the 
somatoseopic is pososcopic or poioscopic puioscopi is piiysiur 
goscopic or aiithropurgoscopic physiurgoscopic is uranoscopic or 
bpigeoscopic epigeoscopio is abioscopic or embioscopic and 
thus mineralogy is the science iaoscopic somatoscopic poioscopic 
fhysiurgoscopic epigeoscopic abioscopic inasmuch as it is the 
soience which regards bodies with reference to their qualities — 
bodies namely thovorks of nature terrestrial lifeless 

 conceive that this bifurcate method is not really philosophical or 
valuable but that is not our business here what we have to con 
sider is whether this is what plato meant by the term dialectic 

the general description of dialectic in the sophistes agrees very 



 


appendix be 


closely with that quoted from the pkadrus that it is the separation 
of n subject according to its natural divisions 

thus see in the sophist the passage § ‘to divide a subject 
according to the kindsof things so as neither to make the same 
kind different nor different kinds identical is the office of the 
dialectical science’ and this is illiistruted by observing that it 
is the uihcc of tlie science of grammar tq determine what letters 
may he combined and what may qot it is the office of the science of 
lusic to determine what sounds differing as acute and grave may 
be combined and what may not and in like manner it is the office 
of the science of dialectic to determine wliat kinds may be com 
bined in one subject and what may not and the proof is still fur 
ther explained 

in many of the platonic dialogues the dialectic which socrates 
is thus represonted as approving appears to include the form of 
dialogue as well as the subdivision of the subject into its various 
branches socrates is presented as attaching so much importance to 
this form tliat in the protagoras § ho rises to dciirt because 
his opponent will not conform to this practice and generally in 
plato dialectic is opposed to rhetoric as a string of short ques 
tions and answers to a continuous dissertation 

xenophon also seems to imply mem iv that socrates 
included in his nation of dialectic the form of dialogue as well as 
the di ision of the subject 

but that the meilod of close dialogue was nut called diahciic 
by the author of the sophist we have good evidence in the work 
itself among other notions which are aiulysed hy the bifurcate 
division here exhibited is that of getting by contest agonistic 
previously given us a division of kteliti now getting by contest 
may be by peaceful trial of superiority or by fight hamilutic or 
machetic the figlit may be of body against body or of words 
agaiiut words these may be called jjiastic and amphisbetic the 
light of viojus about right and wrong may be by long discourses 
opposed to each other as injudicial cases or bsiiort questions 
and answers the former may be called dicanic the latter anti 
logic of these colloquies about right and wrong some are 
natural and spontaneous otliers artificial and studied the former 
need no special name the latter are commonly called eiistic of 
kristic colloquies some are a source of expense to those who hold 
them some of gain that is they are chrematophthoric or chrema 
tisiic the former the occupation of those who talk for pleasure’s 
and for companys sake is adoleschic wasteful garrulity the 
latter that of those who talk for the sake of gain is sophistic 



on plato’s notion of dialectic 

and thus sopliistic is an art eristic which is part of antilojjic 
which is part of arnphihetic which is part of ajonistic which is 
part of cliiiotic wiiich is a part of ktttio § i 

we may notice here an indication that lutire rather than exact 
reason directs these niiilyses in that sophistic which was before 
a part of tiie ihercuilc branch of chirotic and ktetic is here a part of 
lie ohcr biiiiieli 

but the remark wirn h i espceiadly wish to make here is that the 
art of disciissitif‘ points of right and wrong by short ipiesions and 
answer being here brought into view not called dialectic 
w’hirh we might have expected but anihofjic it would seem 
therefore that the author of the sophitt did not understand by 
nialaciic such a jiroccas as socrates dosciib‘s in ximinphon mem 
iv o wlicrelic says it was railed diajectic bcciusc it was 
followed by persons dividing things into their hinds in conversation 
koivti iacyoitai or sucb as the socrates of plato 
insisted upon in the protagoras and the jorgias of the two 
elements which the dialectical process f socrates implied divi 
sion of the subject and dialogue the author of the sophistos does 
not cliiin tiio name of dialectic for cither and seems to reject it 
for the second 

put without insisting upon the name are we to suppose that the 
dichotomous imefhoil of the sophistes dialogue may add of the 
politicus for the method is the same in this dialogue also is the 
metliod of dlvisioii of a subject according to its natural members of 
wliieli plato speaks in the lhrdnisf 

if tlie sophistes be lie work of plato the answer is difiticuu 
either way if tliis method be plato’s dialectic how came he to 
omit to say so theie how cme he even to seem to deny it but 
on the other hand if this dichotomons division be a ditferent pro 
ccss from the division called dialectic in the phrcdriis had plato 
two methods of division of a subject and yet has he never spoken 
of them ns two or marked their distinction 

this difficulty would be removed if wo were to adopt the opinion 
to which others on other groundg have been led that the sophistes 
though of plato’s time is not plato’s work the grounds of this 
opinion are — tiiat the doctrines of the sophistes arc not platonic 
the doctrine of ideas is strongly impugned and weakly defended 
socrates is not the principal speaker but an elcatic stranger and 
there is in the dialogue none of tlie dramatic character which we 
generally have in plato the dialogue seems to be the work of 
some eleiitic opponent of plato rather than ins 

rep b vii blit we can have no doubt that the phxdrus 

fp

contains plato’s real view of the nature of dialectic ns to its form 
let us see how this ajree with the view of dialectic as to its 
matter and ohjcct given in the seventh book of the uepubhc 

according to plato real existences ore the objects of the exact 
sciences as number and figure of aritinnetic and cjeoinctry 
the things which are the objects of sense aie transitory pheiio 
ineiia wiiich have no reality because no cnnanrnce dialectic 
deals with realities in a more general manner this doctrine is 
cvcrywlierc inculcated by plato and particularly in this part of the 
uepuhliti he does not tell ns how we arc to obtain a view of the 
liigher realities which are the objects of dialectic only he here 
assuines that it will result from the ediiratioii which he enjoins 
lie says § that the dialectic process j duthtxtihtj icfionov 
alone leads to true science it makes no assumptions but goes to 
first piinciples that its doctriiics may be firmly grounded and 
thus it jmrges the eye of the soul which wis immersed in barbaric 
mild and turns it upward using for this purpose the aid of the 
sciences which have been mentioned but when haucon iinpiircs 
about the details of this dialectic socrates says he will not then 
answer the inquiry we may venture to say that it does not ap 
pear that he had any answer ready 

let us consider for a iiionient what is said about a philosophy 
rendering a reason for the first principles of each science w hich 
the science itself cannot do that there is room for such a branch 
of philtsopliy in some sciences we easily see jpometry for 
instanfc procoedi from axioms definitions and postulates but by 
the very nature of these terms does not pove these first prin 
ciples these — the axioms definitions and postulates — are i 
conceive what plato here calls the jfpotheses upon which jco 
iiietry proceeds and for which it is not tlie business of geometry to 
render a reason according to him it is the business of dialec 
tic” to give a just account of these “hypotheses” what then is 
dialectic 

 aristotle it is think weil worthy of remark that aristotle 
giving an account in many respect difterent from that of plato of 
the nature of dialectic is still led in the same manner to consider 
dialectic as the branch of philosophy which renders a reason for 
first principles in the topics we have a distinction drawn be 
tween reasoning demonstrative and reasoning dialectical and the 
distinction is tyki—top i that demonstration is by syllogistns 
from true first principles or from true deductions from such prin 
ciples and that the dialectical syllogism is that which syllogizes 
li‘om probable propositions ef evdowv and he adds that 



on platos notion of dialectic 

probable propositions are those wliieli are accepted by all or by the 
reatoat part or by the wie in the next chapter he speaks of 
the uses of dialectic which he says are three mental discipline 
dclate and philosophical science andhe adds top i 
that it is also useful with reference to the first principles in eacli 
science for from the appropriate piinciples of each science we 
cannot deduce unythiiif cmcerninij first principles since tlicso 
piiuciples are the beginnirij of wasoning but from the probable 
iinciplcs in each province of science wt rniist n ‘oncerning 
first principle and this is either the pecuibir office of dialectic 
or the fficc most appropriate to it tor it is a process of investigation 
and must lead to the pnnciiles of all methods 

that a demonstrative scaenee as sncli docs not explain the origin 
of its own i’iist principhs is niuloubtedly true geometry docs 
not undertake to give ii reason for the axioms tcfiuirion and 
jostulates this has been attempted both in ancient and in modern 
times by tiic metaphysicians but the mctiidisics emjiloyed on 
such subjects has not commonly been called dialectic the term 
has certainly been usually einployd rather as describing a method 
than as determining the siihjcct of iiivestigation of the faculty 
which approhcmls first prineifdes both according to plato and to 
aristotle will hereafter say a few words 

the object of tlic dichotonious firocess pnrued in the sopliistes 
and its result in each case i a definition definition also was one 
of the mum features of the impiirics pursued by socrates induclion 
being the other ami imlecil in many cases induction was a horicr 
of steps which fndciii definition ami aristotle also taught a 
peculiar method the object and result of which was the construc 
tion of dofimtiona — namely his udeyones this method ia one 
of division hut very difteroni from the divisions of the sophiatea 
his method begins fy diiding the wliole subject of possible inipiiry 
into ten lieads or cjtcjories — suhtance quantity quality relation 
place i’ime position habit action pasaion tlie again ore 
subdivided thus quality is habit or disposition power affection 
form and we have an exainjje of the aplieutitn of this method 
to the construction of a dehnition in the ethics where he deter 
mines virtue to he a habit with certain additional limitations 

thus the induction of socrates the dichotomy of the elcatics 
the categories of aristotle may all he eonaidered as methods by 
which we proceed to the construction of definitions if by any 
method plato could proceed to the construction of a definition or 
rather of an idea of the absolute realities on which first princi 
ples depend such a method would correspond with the notion of 



appendix bb 


 

dialectio in the republic and if it was a method of division like 
the eleatic or aristoteliu it would correspond with the notion of 
dicilectic in the phccdrus 

that plato’s notion ifbwever cannot have been exactly either of 
these is i think plain the colloquial method of stiiniilatin and 
testing the proress of the student in dialectic is implied in the 
sequel of this discussion of the effect of scientific study and the 
metliod of dialogue us the instraiinent of instruction being thus 
supposed the continuation of tho account in the republic implies 
that plato expected persons to be inado dialectical by tlie study of 
the exact sciences in a comprehensive spirit after insisting on 
geometry and other sciences he says rep vii § ‘the 
synoptical man is dialectical and he who is not the ono is not 
the other” 

but we may ask does a knowledge of sciences lead naturally to 
a knowledge of ideas as absolute realities from which firt prin 
ciples how and supposing this to be true as the platonic phi 
losophy supposes is the idea of the good as the source of moral 
truths to be thus attained to that it is is the teaching of 
plato here and elsewhere but have the speculations of subsequent 
philosophers in the same direction given any confirmation of this 
lofty assumption 

in reply to this inquiry i should venture to say that this 
assumption appeai s to he a reinnaut of the socratic doctrine from 
which plato hogaii his speculations that virtue is a kind of know 
ledge and that all attempts to verify the assumption have failed 
v’hat plato added to the socratic notion ws that the inquiry 
after the good tho supreme good was to he aided by the 
analogy or suggestions of those sciences which deal with neces 
sary and eternal truths the supreme good being of the nature 
of those necessary and eternal truths this notion is a striking 
one da a suggestion but it has always failed i think in the 
attempts to urk it out those who in modern times as cudworth 
and samuel clarke have supposed an analogy between the neces 
sary trpths of geometry and the truths of morality though they 
have used the like expressions concerning the one and the other 
class of truths have failed to convey clear doctrines and steady con 
victions to their readers and have now believe few or no 
followers 

the result of our investigation appears to be that though plato 
added much to the matter by means of which the mind was to 
be improved and disciplined in its research after principles and 
definitions he did not establish any form of method according 



on platos notion op dialectic 

to which the inquiry must be conducted and by which it miht 
bo aided the most definite notion of dialectic still remained 
the same with the original informal view which socrates hod 
taken of it as xenophon tells us mem when he says 
“lie said that dialectic xd diaxeyeortlat was so called because 
it is an inquiry pursued by persons who take counsel together 
heparating the subjects considered according to their kinds dia 
xcyovta lie held accordiiigythat men should try to bo well 
prepared for such a process and should pursue it with diligence 
by this means he thought they would become good men fitted 
for responsible offices of command and truly diulcctical’ dtaeic 
ttkoitatous and this is i conceive the answer to mr grote’s 
interrogatory exclamation vol viii p “surely the ety 
mology here given by xenophon or socrates of the word ta 
xeyevdai cannot he considered as satisfactory the two notions 
of investigatory dialogue and distribution of notions according 
to their kinds which are thus asserted to be connected in etymology 
were among the followers of socrates connected in fact the 
dialectic dialogue was supposed to involve of course the dialectic 
division of the subject

or the intellectual poweiis accord 
ing to plato 

ctna pild soc nov 


jn the seventh book of plato’s we have certain seienees 

described as the instruments of a philosophical aid intelloctiial 
education and we have a certain other intclletual einloymont 
spoken of namely biuleetie as the means of carrying the mind 
beyond these sciences and of cnablinj ir to see the sources of 
those truths which the sciences assume as their firt principles 
these points have been discussed in the two prccedinj papers 
but this scheme of the highest kind of philosophical education 
proceeds upon a certain view of the nature and dejjrecsof knovvledje 
and of the powers by which we know wdiich view had been pre 
sented in a great measure in the sixth book this view shall 
now attempt to illustrate 

to analyse the knowing powers of man is a task so diflficulfc that 
wc need not ho surprised if there is much obscurity tii this portion 
of plato’s writings but as a reason for amining what he has 
said we must recollect that if there bo in it anything on this sub 
ject which was true then it is true still and also that if wo know 
 any truth on that subject now we shall find something correspond 
ing to that truth in the best speculations of sagacious ancient 
writef like plato it may therefore be worth while to discuss 
the platoiiiddoctrines on this matter and to inquire how they are 
to be expressed in modern phraseology 

plaljp’s doctrine will perhaps be most clearly understood if we 
begin by considering the diagram by which ho illustrates the 
different degrees of knowledge lie sets out from the distinction 
of visible and intelligible things there arc viihlo objects squares 
and triangles for instance but these are not the squares and tri 
angles about which the geometer reasons the exactness of his 
reasoning does not depend on the exactness of his diagrams he 


 pol vl § 



of the intellectual poweus 


reasons from certain mental squares and triangles as he conceives 
and understjinds them thiis there are visible and there are 
intelligible things there is a visible and an intelligible ’orld‘ 
and there are two didereiit regions aboiitwhich our knowledge is 
concerned now take a line divided into two unequal segments to 
represent these two regions and again divide each segment in the 
same ratio the parts of each segment are to rcprestuif differences 
of clearness and distinctness atl in the visilde world these parts 
are things and images by images i mean shadows and rehectiuiis 
in witer and in polished bodies and by ihings mean tliat of 
which these images are the resemblances as animals plants 
things made by man this diiference corresponds to the diflereiice 
of knoivlctige and mere opinion and the opinahle is to the know 
able as the image to the beality 

tiiis analogy is assented to by olaucon and thus there is as 
sumed a ground for a further construction of the diauratn 

“now’ he says “we have to divide the segment which repre 
sents intelligible things in the same way in which wo have divided 
that which represents visible things the one part must repre 
sent the knowledge which the mind gets by dealing as it were with 
images and by reasoning downwards from principles the other 
that which it lias by dealing with the ideas themselves and going 
to first principles 

“the one part defiends upon assumptions or hypotheses the 
other is unhypothetical or absolute truth 

“one kind of intelligible things then is conceptions for in 
stance geometrical isnceptions of figures by means of which we 
reason downwards assuming certain first principles 

‘nuw the other kind of intelligible things is this — that which 
the reason includes in virtue of its power of reasoning when it 


s lie adds “this orahw this visi 
ble worj i will not say has any 
connexion with onranon heaven 
that may not be accused of plray ag 
upon word” 

 it is plain that plato hy hypo 
ihesesf in this place means the usual 
foundations of arithmetic and geo 
metry namely definitions and pos 
tulates he says that “the arith 
meticians and geometers take as hypo 
theses vtroeroi odd and even and 


the three kinds of angles riglit acute 
and obtuse and figures las a trian 
gle a square and tlie like” i say 
his “hypotheses” are the definitions 
and poituiate‘ not the axioms for 
the axioms of aritliinetic and geo 
metry belong to the higher faculty 
whirh ascends to first principles 
but this fjuhilty operates rather in 
using these axioms than in enunciat 
ing them it knows them implicitly 
rather than expresses them explicitly

rejards the assumptions of the sciences as what they are assump 
tions onl and uses them as occasions and starting points that 
from these it may ascend to the absolute diwirooetoi unhy 
pothcticul which does not depend upon assumption but is the 
orifn of scientific truth the lieason takes hold of this first prin 
ciple of truth and availing itself of all the connections and rela 
tions of this principle it proceeds to the conclusion using no 
sensible image in doing this biitcontenipiating the meas alone 
and with these ideas the process begins goes on and terminates ” 

this account of the mutter will proliably seem to require at least 
further explanation and that accordingly is acknowledged in the 
dialogue itself glaueon says 

• i apprehend your iiicaning in a certain degree but no very 
clearly for the tnatter is somewhat abstruse you wish to prove 
that the knowledge which by the reason we acquire of real 
existence and intelligible things is of a higher degree of certainty 
than the knowledge which belongs to what are commonly called 
sciences such sciences you say have certain assuiiiptiuns for 
their bases and these assumptions are by the students of such 
sciences apprehended not by sense that is the bodily senses 
but by a mental operation — by conception but inasmuch as 
such students ascend no higher than the assuintions and do not go 
to the first principles of truth they do not seem t you to have 
true knowledge— intuitive insight — nous — on the suqjcct of iheir 
reasonings though the subjects are intelligible along with their 
principle and you call this habit and practice of the geometers 
and others by the name conception not naition taking con 
ception to be something between opinion on the one side and 
intuitive insight on the other 

 “you have explained it well said i and now consider the 
four sections of the line of which we have spoken as corresponding 
to four affections in the mind intuition the highest’ conception 
the next th third belief and the fourth conjecture from 
likenesses and arrange them in order so that they may have more 
or less of certainty as their objects hive more or less of truth

understand said he i agree to what jrou say and arrange 
them as you direct” 

and so the sixth book ends and the seventh book opens 
with tlie celebrated image of the cave in hich men are confined 
and see all exlernul objects only by the shadows which they cast 
on the walls of their rison and this imperfect knowledge of 
things is to the true vision of them which is attained by those 
who ascend to the light of day as the ordinary knowledge of men is 
to the knowledge attainable by those whose minds are purged and 
illiiiniriuled by a true jdiilosophy 

confining ourselves at present to the part of plato’s speculations 
which we have mentioned namely the degrees of knowledge 
and tle division of our knowing faculties we may understand 
and may in a great degree accept plato’s scheme we have already 
in the preceding papers seen that by the knowledge of real 
things he means in the first place the knowledge of universal 
and necessary trutiis such as geometry and the other exact scieneea 
deal with these we call sciences of demonstration and we 
are in the habit of contrasting the knowledge which constitutes 
such sciences with the knowledge obtained by the senses by ex 
perience or mere observation this distinction of demonstrative 
and kiiipirlcul knowledge is a cardinal point in plato’s scheme 
also the former alone being allowed to deserve the name of 
knowledgcf and the latter being only opinion the objects with 
which demonstration deals may be termed conceptions uiid the 
objects with which obscrvatiuii or sense has to do however 
much speculation may ftduce them to mere sensations are commonly 
described as things of these things there may be shadows or 
images os plato says and us we may obtain a certain kind of 
knowledge namely opinion or belief by seeing the things them 
selves we may obtain an inferior kind of opinion or belief by seeing 
their linages which kind of opinion we may for the inoraeflt call 
conjecture whether then we regard the distinctions knowledge 
itself or of the objects of it we have three terms before us 

if we consider the kinds of knowledge they are 
demonstration belief conjecture 

if the objects of this knowledge they are 
conceptions things images 


plato supposes the whole and each of the two parts to be divided in the 
same ratio in order that the aiiolopy of the division in each case may be 
represented 




 


appendix c 


but in each of these scries the first term is evidently wanting for 
demonstration supposes principles to reason from conceptions 
suppose some basis in the mind which gives them their evidence 
what then is the tirst tcam in each of tliese two series 

the principles of demonstration must be seen by intuition 
conceptions deiive their properties from certain powers or 
attributes of the mind wliich we may term ideas 

therefore the two scries are 

intuition demonstration belief conjecture 

ideas conceptions things 

plato further teaches that the two former terms in each series 
belong to tlic intelligible the two latter to the visible world 
and ho siipjioses that the ratio of these two irimary segments 
of the line is the same as the ratio in wdiich each segment is 
dividcml 

 using the term ideas to describe the mental sources from 
which conceptions derive their validity in deinontration am 
employing a pliiaseology which have already introduced in the 
philosophy of the inductive sciences but indepcnfuntly altogether 
of this do not see what other term could be employed to denote 
the mental objects attriluites or powers whatever they lie from 
which conceptions derive their evidence as demonstrative truths 
derive their evidence from intuitive truths 

that the scheme just presented is pluto’s doctrine on this subject 
i do not conceive ticro can be any doubt ’j’liere is a little want 
of precision in his ilirascology arising froj his mixing together 
the two series in fact his final series 

nolsis pianoia pislis eikasia 
is made by putting in the second place instead of demonstration 
‘which is the process pursued or science which is the knowledge 
obtained conception which is the object with which the mind 
deals sucljf deviations from exact symmetry and correlation in 
speaking of the faculties of the mind aro almost unavoidable in 
every langiiugc and there is yet another source of such inac 
curacies of language for we have to speak not only of the 
process of acquiiing knowledge and of the objects with which 
the mind deals but of the faculties of the mind which are 
thus employed thus intuition is the process ideas are the 


the four kednients might be os s z or as g or generally 
as a ar ar ar 



of the intellectual powers 


object in the first term of our series the faculty also we 
may call intuifitm but the greek offers a distinction noesis 
is the process of intuition but the faculty is nous if we 
wish to preserve this distinction in enlfth what must we call 
the faculty conceive we must call it the intuitive reason a 
term well known to our older pliilosopliical writers again 
taking the second term of the series demonstration is the process 
science the result and conceptions are the objects with wtiich 
the mind deals but what is the faculty ihus eindnyod what 
is the faculty emjdoycd in demonstration the hanie philosophical 
writers of whom i spoke would have answered at once the dis 
cursive reason and i do not know that even now we can suggest 
any better term the faciiltv employed in aeipiiring the two lower 
kinds of knowledge the faculty which deals with things and 
their images is of course sense or smsation 

the assertion of a faculty of the mind hy which it appre 
hends truth which faculty is higher than the discursive reason 
as the truth apprehended by it is higher than more demonstrative 
truth agrees as it will at once occur to several of my renders 
with the doctrine taught and iniled upon by the late samuel 
taylor coleridge and so far as he was the means of inculcating 
this doctrine which as we see is the doctrine of plato and 
might add of arntotle and of many other philosophers let him 
have due honour but in his desire to impress the doctrine upon 
men’s minds he combined it with several other tenets whirh will 
not bear examination he held that the two faculties by which 
these two kinds of taith are apprehended and which as i have 
said our pliilosopliical writers call ike intuitive reason and the 
discursive reason may be called and ought to be called respectively 
the reason and the understanding and that the second of thes 
is of the nature of the instinct of animals so as to be something 
intermediate between hetison and instinct these opinion i may 
venture to say are altogether erroneous the intuiti reason and 
the discursive reason are not by any english writers called the 
reason and the understnndii and accordingly coleridge has 
had to alter all the passages namely those taken from leighton 
harrington and bacon from which his exposition proceeds the 
umlerstanding is so far from being especially the discursive or 


hence the mind reason receives 
intuitive or discursive

reasoning faculty that it in univernal and by our best 

writers opposed to the discursive or ucasonin faculty thus this 
is expressly declared by sir john davis in his poem on the immor 
tality of the soul he inys of the soul 

wlii‘ she rales things and moves from ground to ground 

 the nriiue of heason iliatio kbo acquires from this 

but when by rojison she truth hath found 

and stjuuleth flt she lodt rstamling is 

instead of the reason beinjf fixed and the understandinfr discur 
sive as mr coleridpfe says the reason is distinctively discursive 
that is it obtains conclusions by running from ono point to another 
this is what is meant by diseursus or trikinci the full term dw 
cursns itatiums discourse of reason understand in is fixed that 
is it dwells ui one view of a subject and not upon the steps by 
winch that view is obtained the verb to reason implies the snb 
stantive the reason though it is nut coevtenivc with it for as 
have said there is the intuitive reason as well as the discursive 
reason but it is by the faculty of reason that we are capable of 
reasoning thoufli undoubtedly the practice or the pretence of rea 
soninpf may he carried so fur us to seem at variance with reason in 
the more familiar sense of the term as is the case also iii french 
moliero’s crisale says in the femmes savantes 

lla onner est vomploi lc toute ma maisoi 

ft lo raisoiiuemeut en baniiit la raison 

if mr coleridfe’s assertion were true that the understanding is 
the discursive and the reason the fixed faenfty we should bo justi 
fied in sayinc that the under standituj is the faculty hy which lee 
reason and the reason is the faculty hy which toe understand but 
this is not so 

nor is the understanding of the nature of instinct nor does it 
approach nearer than the reason to the nature of instinct but tbe 
contrary fie instincts of animals bcar a very obscure resem 
blance to any of man’s speculative faculties but so far as there is 
any siioh resemblance instinct is obscure image of reason not 
of understanding animals are said to act as if they reasoned 
rather than as if they understood the verb understand is especially 
applied to man as distinguished from animals mr coleridge tfclls 
a tale from huber of certain bees which to prevent a piece of 
honey from fulling balanced it by tlieir weight w hile they built a 
pillar to suport i they did this by instinct not understanding 
what they did men doing the same would have understood what 
they were doing our translation of the scriptures in making 



of tie intellectual powers 


it the spcdal lustinction of man and animals that he has under 
standing and they have not speaks quite consistently with good 
philosophy and good english 

air coleridges object in his specnlatims is nearly the same as 
platos namely to declare that there is a truth of a higher kind 
than can be obtained by mere reasoning and also to claim as por 
tions of this higlier truth certain fundamental doctrines of morality 
among these mr coleridge places the authority of conseience 
and plato the supremo gool mr coleridge also holds as plato 
held thjt the reason of man in its highest una most comprehensive 
form is a ortioii of a supreme and universal reason and lends to 
truth not in virtue of its special attributes in each person but by 
its own nature 

many of the opinions which are combined with these doctrines 
both in plato and in coleridge are such as we should i think find 
it impossible to accept upon a careful philosophical examination of 
them but on these t shall not here dwell 

i will only further observe that if any one were to doubt whether 
the term noijs is rightly rendered intuitive reason we may find 
proof of the propriety of a rendering in the remarkable discus 
sion concerning the intellectual virtues which we have in the 
sixtli hook of the niconiachcan ethics it can hardly be question 
ed that aristotle had in lils mind in writing that passage the 
doctrines of plato •as expounded in the passage just examined and 
similar passages aritotlc there says that tliero are five intellee 
tuui viitucs or faculties by which the mind aims at truth in 
asserting or den yingj— namely art science prudence wisdom 
nous in this enumeration passing over art prudence and wis 
dom as virtues wdiich are mainly concerned from practical life we 
have in the region of speculative truth a distinction propounded 
between science and nous and this distinction is further explained 
c g by the remarks that science reasons with principles aad that 
these principles cannot be given hy science because sfjence reasons 
from them nor by art nor prudence for these are conversant with 
matters contingent not with matters demonstrable nor can the 
first principles of the reasoniligs of science be given by w’isdom 
for wisdom herself has often to reason from principles therefore 
tli first principles of demonstrative reasoning must be given by 
a peculiar faculty nous as we have said intuitive reason is the 
most appropriate english term for this faculty 

the view thus given of that higher kind of knowledge which 
plato and aristotle place above ordinary science as being the 
knowledge of and faculty of learning first principles will enable 



appendix c 


 

u to explain some expressions which might otherwise be misunder 
stood socrates in the concluding part of this sixth book of the 
liepublic says that this kind of knowledge is that of which the 
reason xdyos takes hfcld in virtue of us power of reasoning 
here we are plainly not to understand that we arrive at first prin 
ciples by reasoning for the very opposite is true and is here taught 
— namely that first principles are not what we reason to but what 
we reason ftorn the meaning o this passage plainly is that first 
principles are those of which tlie reason takes hold in virtue of its 
power of reasoning — they are the conditions which must exist in 
order to make any reasoning possible — they are the propositions 
which the reason must involve implicitly in order tliat we may 
reason explicitly — they are the intuitive roots of the dialectical 
power 

in accordance with the views now explained platos diagram 
may be thus further expanded the term lhea is not used in this 
part of the liepublic but as is well known occurs in its peculiar 
platonic sense in the tenth book

criticism of aristotle’s account of 

induction 

 

cam phd soc feb 


rphe cambridge philosophical society has willicgly admitted 
among its proceedings not only contributions to science but also 
to the philosophy of science and it is to be presumed that this 
vriuingness will not be less if the speculations concerning the philo 
sophy of science which are offered to the society involve a reference 
to ancient authors induction the process by which general truths 
are collected from particular examples is one min point in such 
philosophy and the comparison of the views of induction enter 
tained by ancient and modern writers has already attracted much 
notice do not intend now to go into this subject at any length 
but there is a cardinal passage on the subject in aristotles analytics 
analyl prior ii which wish to explain and discuss i will 
first translate it maki such emendations as are requisite to render 
it intelligible and consistent of which i shall afterwards give an 
account 

i will number the sentences of this chapter of aristotle in order 
that i may afterwards bo able to refer to them readily 

 we must now proceed to observe that we have to esftimine 
not only syllogisms according to the aforesaid yfzrcysyllogisms 
logical and demonstrative — but also rhetorical syllogisms— and 
speaking generally any kind of proof by which belief is influenced 
following any method 

§ all belief arises either from syllogism or from induction 
we must now therefore treat of induction 

§ induction and the inductive syllogism is when by means of 
one extreme term we infer the other extreme term to be true of the 
middle term 

§ thus if a c bo the extremes and b the mean we have 
to show by means of c that a is true of b 



 


appendix d 


§ thus let a be longlived that lohich has no gall 
bladder and c particular longlived animals us elephant horse 
mule 

§ then everjr ci a for all the animals above named are 
longlived 

§ also every c is b for all those animals arc destitute of 
gallbladder 

§ then j and c arc convertible and the mean docs 
not extend further than extreme c it necessarily follows that 
every ji is a 

§ ‘hor it was shown before that if any two things be 
true of tho same and if either of them be convertible with the ex 
treme tho other of the things predicated is true of the convertible 
extreme 

§ but wc must conceive tliat c consists of n collection of 
all tho particular cases for induction is applied to all the cases 

§ “ but such a syllogism is an iuierciice of a first truth and 
immediate proposition 

§ “lor when there is a mean term there is a demonstrative 
iiyllogisni through the mean but when there is not a mean there is 
proof by inductign 

§ “ and in a certain way induction is contrary to syllogism 
for syllogism proves by the middle term that the extreme is true of 
the third thing but induction proves by means of the third thing 
that the extreme is true of the mean 

§ and syllogisn concluding by means of a middle term is 
prior by nature and more usual to us but fiio proof by induction 
is more luminous” • 

 think that the chapter thus interpreted is quite coherent and 
intelligible although at first there seems to be some confusion 
from the author sometimes saying that induction is a kind of syllo 
gism and at other times that it is not tlio amount of the doctrine 
is this 

when wc collect a general proposition by induction from par 
ticular cases as for instance thit all animals destitute of gall 
bladder acaolous are longlived if this proposition were true of 
which hereafter wc may express the process in the form of a syllo 
gism if we will agree to make a collection of particular cases our 
middle term and assume that the proposition in which tho second 
extreme term occurs is convertible thus the known propositions 
are 

elephant horse male c are longlived 

elephant horse mule c are aeholous 



criticism op aristotles iisduction 

but if we suppose that the latter proposition is convertible we 
shall have these propositions 

elephant horse mule c are lolivcd 

all acholoub animals are elephant horse mule c 
from whence we infer quite rigorously as to form 

all acholoiib animals are longlived 

this mode of putting the induetive inference shows both the 
strong and the weak point of the illustration of induction by means 
of syllogism the strung point is this that we make the inference 
perfect as to form by including an indefinite collection of particular 
cases elephant horse mule c in a single term c the syllo 
gism then is 

all c are longlived 

all acholous animals are c 

therefore all acholous animals are longlived 

the weak point of this illustration is that at least in some 
instances when the number of actual cases is necessarily indefinite 
the representation of them as a single thing involves an unauthorised 
htep in order to give the reasoning which really passes in the 
mind we must say 

elephant horse c are longlived 

all acholous animals arc is elephant horse cr 

therefore all acholous animals arc longlived 

this must be introduced iu order that the “all c of the 
first proposition may be justified by the of the second 

this step is i say necessarily unauthorized where the number of 
particular cases is indefinite in the instance before us the species 
of acholous animals wo do not know how many such species there 
are yet we wish to be able to assert that all acholous animals are 
longlived in the proof of such a proposition put in a syllogistic • 
form there must necessarily be a logical defect and the aboe dis 
cussion shows that this defect is the substitution of thejpruposition 

“ all acholous animals are as elephant c’ for the converse of 
the experimentally proved proposition elephant c arc acholous 

in instances in which the number of particular cases is limited 
the necessary existence of a logical flaw in the syllogistic translation 
of the process is not so evident but in truth such a flaw exists in 
all cases of induction proper for induction by mere enumeration 
can hardly be called induction will however consider for a 
moment the instance of a celebrated proposition which has often 
been taken as an example of induction and in which the number of 
particular cases is or at least is at present supposed to be limited 
keplers laws for instance the law that the planets describe ellipse 


qq 



 


appendix d 


may be regarded as examples of induction the law was inferred 
we will suppose from an examination of the orbits of mars earth 
venus and the syllogjstic illustration which aristotle gives will 
with the necessary addition to it stand thus 

mars earth venus descnbc euipscs 

mars earth venus are planets 

assuming the convertibility of this last proposition and its unixter 
sality which is the necessary addition in order to make aristotle’s 
syllogism valid we say 

all the planets are as mars earth venus 

whence it follows that all the planets describe ellipses 

if instead of this assumed universality the astronomer had made 
a real enumeration and had established the fact of each particular 
he would be able to say 

saturn jupiter mars earth venus mercury describe 
ellipses 

saturn jupiter mars earth venus mercury arc all the 
planets 

and he would obviously be entitled to convert the second proposi 
tion and then to conclude that 

all the planets describe ellipses 

but then if this were given as an illustration of induction by 
means of syllogism we should have to remark in the first place that 
the conclusion thac all the planets describe ellipses” adds nothing • 
to the major proposition that s j m e v m do so” it is 
merely the same proposition expressed in ther words so long as 
 j m e y m are supposed to be all the planets and in 
the next place we have to make a remark which is more important 
that the minor in such an example must generally be either a very 
precarious truth or as appears in this case a transitory error ’ for 
that the planets known at any time are all the planets must always 
be a doubtful assertion liable to be overthrown tonight by an astro 
nomical observation and the assertion as received in kepler’s 
time has been overthrown for saturn jupiter mars earth 
venus mercury are not all the planets iot only have several new 
ones been discovered at intervals as uranus ceres juno fallas 
vesta but we have new ones discovered every day and any conclu 
sion depending upon this premiss that a b c d o to 
z are all the planets is likely to be falsified in a few years by tho 
discovery of a b c if therefore this were the syllogistic 
analysis of induction keplers discovery rested upon a false propo 
sition and even if the analysis were now made conformable to our 
present knowledge that induction analysed as above would still 



criticism of aristotles induction 

involve a proposition which tomorrow may show to be false but 
yet no one suppose doubts that keplers discovery was really a 
discovery — the establishment of a scieiitibc truth on solid grounds 
or that it is a scientihc truth for us notwithstanding that we are 
constantly discovering new planets therefore the syllogistic ana 
 ’sis of it now discussed namely that which introduces simple enu 
neratiun as a step is not the right analysis and does not represent 
the grounds of the inductive truth that all the planets describe 
ellipses 

it may be said that all the planets discovered since keplers time 
conform to his law and thus confirm his discovery this we grant 
hut they only confirm the discovery they do not make it they are 
not its groundwork it was a discovery before these new cases 
were known it was an inductive truth without them still an 
objector might urge if any one of these new planets had contradict 
ed the law it would have overturned the discovery but this is too 
boldly said a discovery which is so precise so complex in the 
phenomena which it explains so supported by innumerable observa 
tions extending through space and time is not so cosily overturned 
if we find that uranus or that enekes comet deviates from kep 
ler’s and newton’s laws we do not infer that these laws must be 
false we say that there must be some disturbing caute in these 
cases wo seek and we find these disturbing causes in the case of 
uranus a new planet in the case of encke’s comet a resisting 
medium even in this case therefore though the number of parti 
culars is limited the induction was not made by a simple enumera 
tion of all the particulars it was made from a few cases and when 
the law was discerned to be true in these it was extended to all the 
conversion and assumed universality of the proposition that these 
are planets giving us the proposition which we need for the syllo 
gistic exhibition of induction all the planets are as these 

i venture to say further that it is plain that aristotle did not 
regard induction as the result of simple enumeration jbis is plain 
in the first place from his example any proposition with regard 
to a special class of animals cannot bo proved by simple enumera 
tion for the number of particfllar cases that is of animal species 
in the class is indefinite at any period of zoological discovery and 
must be regarded os infinite in the next place aristotle says § 
of the above extract we must conceive that ccousists of a col 
lection of all the particular cases for induction is applied to all tlie 
eases we must conceive ioctv that c in the major consists of all 
the cases in order that the couclusion may be true of all the cases 
but we cannot observe all the cases but the evident proof that 
aristotle does not contemplate in this chapter an induction by siin 



 


appendix d 


pie enumeratiod is the contrast in which he places induction and 
syllogism for induction by simple enumeration stands in no con 
trust to syllogism the syllogism of such induction is quite logi 
cal and conclusire butdnduction from a comparatively small num 
ber of particular cases to a general law does stand in opposition 
to syllogism it gives us a truth — a truth which as aristotle 
says § is more luminous than a truth proved syllogisticolly 
though syllogism maybe more natural and usual it gives ns g 
immediate propositions obtained directly from observation and not 
by a chain of reasoning first truths the principles from which 
syllogistic reasonings may be deduced the syllogism proves by 
means of a middle term § that the extreme is true of a third 
thing thus acholous being the middle term 

achfilous animals are longlived 

all elephants are acholous animals 

therefore all elephants are itfnglived 

but induction proves by means of a third thing namely particular 
cases that the extreme is true of the mean thus acholous still 
being the middle term 

elephants are longlived 

elephants are acholous animals 

therefore acholous animals are longlived 

it may be objected such reasoning as this is quite inconclusive 
and the answer is thart this is precisely what we and as believe 
aristotle are here pointing out induction is inconclusive as rea 
sonimj it is not reasoning it is another way of getting at truth 
as we have seen no reasoning can prove snos an inductive truth as 
this that all planets describe ellipses it is known from observation 
but it is not demonstrated nevertheless no one doubts its uni 
versal truth except as aforesaid when disturbing causes intervene 

 and tlicnco induction is as aristotle says opposed to syllogistic 
rcasonf ng and yet is a means of discovering truth not only so but 
a means of liscovering primary truths immediately derived from 
observation 

i hare elsewhero taught that all induction involves a conception 
of the mind applieil to facts it mky be asked whether this applies 
in such a case as that given by aristotle and i reply that 
aristotle instance is a very instructive example of what i mean 
the conception which is applied to the facts in order to make the 
induction possible is the want of the gallbladder — and aristotle 
supplies us with a special term for this conception ackotous but 


i this term occurs in other parts of aristotle boe the additional noisl 




criticism of aristotles iisduction 

it may be said that the animals observed the elephant horse mule 
c are acholous is a mere fact of observation not a conception 

 reply that it is a selected fact a fact selected and compared in 
several cases which is what we mean by a onception that there 
is needed for such selection and comparison a certain activity of the 
mind is evident but this also may become more clear by dwelling 
 little further on the subject suppose that aristotle having a 
desire to know what class of animals are longlived had dissected 
for that purpose many animals elephants horses cows sheep 
goats deer and the like ilow many rcsem i lances how many dif 
ferences must he have observed in their anatomy he was very 
likely long in fixing upon any one resemblance which was common 
to ail the longlived probably he tried several other characters 
before he tried the presence and absence of the gallbladder — per 
haps trying such characters ho found them succeed for a few cases 
and then fail in others so that he had to reject them as useless for 
his purpose all the while the absence of the gallbladder in the 
longlived animals was a fact but it was of no use to him because 
he had not selected it and drawn it forth from the mass of other 
facts he was looking for a mean term to connect his first extreme 
long liredf with his second the special cases lie sought this mid 
dle term in the entrails of the many animals which he used as 
extremes it was there but he could not find it the fact existed 
blit it was of no use for the purpose of induction because it did 
not become a special conception in his mind he considered the 
animals in various points of view it may be as ruminant as 
horned as hoofed awh the contrary but not as acholous and the 
contrary when he looked at animals in that point of view — 
when he took up that character as tho ground of distinction he 
forthwith imagined that he found a separation of longlived and 
shortlived animals when that fact became a conception he ob 
tained an inductive truth or at any rate an inductive proposition 

he obtained an inductive proposition by applying tlv conception 
acholous to liis observation of animals this conception divided 
them into two classes and these classes were he fancied longlived 
and shortlived respectively tliat it was the conception and not 
the fact which enabled him to obtain his inductive proposition is 
further plain from this that tho supposed fact is not a fact 
acholous animals are not longerlived than others the presence 
or absence of the gallbladder is no character of longevity it is 
true that in one familiar class of animals the herbivorous kind 
there is a sort of first seeming of the truth of aristotle’s asserted 
rule for the horse and mule which have not the gallbladder aro 



appendix d 


 

longerlived than the cow sheep and goat which have it bnt if 
we pursue the investigation further the rule soon fails the deer 
tribc that want the gallbladder are not longerlived than the other 
ruminating animals whiisti have it and as a conspicuous evidence 
of the falsity of the rule man and the elephant are perhaps for 
their size the longestlived animals and of these man has and the 
elephant has not the organ in question the inductive proposition 
then is false but what we have mainly to consider is where the 
fallacy enters according to aristotle’s analysis of induction into 
syllogism for the two premisses are still true that elephants c 
are longlived and that elephants c are acliolous and it is 
plain that the tallacy comes in with that conversion and generaliza 
tion of the latter proposition which wo have noted as necessary to 
aristotle’s illustration of induction when we say all achulous 
animals are as elephants that is as those in their biological 
conditions wo say what is not true aristotles condition § is 
not complied with that the middle term shall not extend beyond 
the extreme por the character acholotts does extend beyond the 
elephant and the animals biologically resembling it it extends to 
deer c which are not like elephants and horses in the point in 
question and thus we see that the assumed conversion and 
generalization of the minor proposition is the seat of the fallacy of 
false inductions as it is the scat of the peculiar logical character of 
true inductions 

as true inductive propositions cannot be logically demonstrated 
by syllogistic rules so they cannot be discovered by any rule there 
is no foimula for the discovery of inductive tluth it is caught by 
a peculiar sagacity or power of divination for which no precepts 
can be given but from what has been said we see that this saga 
city shows itself in the discovery of propositions which are both 
 frue and convertible in the sense above explained both these steps 
may bc difficult the former is often very laborious and when the 
labour has lioen expended and a true proposition obtained it may 
turn out useless because the proposition is not convertible it was 
a matter of great labour to kepler to prove from calculation of 
observations that mars moves elliptically before he proved this 
he had tried to prove many similar propositions — that mars moved 
according to the bisection of the eccentricity” — according to the 
vicarious hypothesis” — according to the physical hypothesis” — 
and the like but none of these was found to be exactly true the 
proposition that mars moves elliptically was proved to bo true 
but still there was the question is it convertible do au the 
planets move as mars moves this was proved suppose to be 



criticism of aristotles induction 

true for the earth and venub but still the question remains do 
all the planets move as mars earth venus do the inductive 
generulizinf impulse boldly answers yes to this question though 
the rules of syllogism do not authorize the answer and though there 
remain untried cases the inductive philosopher tries the cases as 
fast as they occur in order to confirm his previous conviction but 
if he hud to wait for belief and conviction till he had tried every 
case he never could have belief or conviction of such a proposition 
at all lie is prepared to modify or add to his inductive truth 
according as new cases and new observations instruct him but he 
does not fear that new coses or now observations will overturn an 
inductive proposition established by exact comparison of many com 
plex and various phenomena 

aristotles example oifers somewhat similar reficctions lie had 
to establish a proposition ceuceriiing longlived animals which 
should be true and should be susceptible of generalized conversion 
to prove that the elephant horse and mule are destitute of gall 
bladder required at least the labour of anatomizing those animals 
in the seat of that organ but this labour was not enough for he 
would find those animals to agree in many other things besides in 
being uohulous c must have selected that character somewliat at 
a venture and the guess was wrong as a little more labour ivould 
have shonii him if for instance he had dissected doer for they are 
acholous and yet shortlived a trial of this kind would have shonn 
him that the extreme term acholous did extend beyond the mean 
namely aniniuls such as elephant horse mule and therefore that 
the conversion was nqt allowable and that the induction was unten 
able in truth there is no relation between bile and longevity 
and ibis example given by aristotle of generalization from induction 
is an unfortunate one

appendix d 


in discussing this passage of aristotle hare made two atera 
lions in the text one oftyhih is necessary on account of the fact 
the otlieron account of the sense in the received text the parti 
cular examples of longlived animals given are man horse and mule 
to de r to kaockatrtov fiakpofiiov otou avopwjroi kui llriro 
kai tjpioiov and it is afterwards said that all these are acholom 
dwd kai t b ttj fxfi eypv irairl btrdpcl tw p but 

man has a gallbladder and the fact was well known in aristotle’s 
time for instance to hippocrates so that it is not likely that 
aristotle would have made the mistake which the text contains 
but at any rate it is a mistake if not of the transcriber of aristotle 
and it is impossible to reason about the passage without correcting 
the mistake the substitution of execjar for dtoptoiros makes the 
reasoning ooberent but of course any other achulous longlived 
animal would do so equally avell 

the other emendation which have made is in § in the re 
ceived text § g and stand thus 

‘ c then every c is a for evejj adiolous animal is longlived 
rip dn r ow vwdpxci t a jrdv yap ts doxov fjlakpojiiop 

 also every c is for all c is destitute of bile 

whence it may uc inferred says aristotle under certain condi 
tions that every ji is a tw a ti b vjrdpxeiu that is that every 
acholohs animal is longlived but this conclusion is according to 
the common reading identical with the majof’premiss so that the 
passage is manifestly corrupt correct it by substituting for 
dxoavf p and thus reading nrdv yap to p fiakpoftiov “ for every 
c is longlived” just as hi the parallel sentence we have axa 
vot to b td pij expv travrl virdpci tp p in this way 

the reaioning becomes quite clear the corrupt substitution of 
dyoxov for may have been made in various ways which need 
not suggest as my business is with the sense of the passage and 
as it makes no sense without the change and very good sense with 
it cannot hesitate to make the emendation and these emenda 
tions being made aristotle’s view of the nature and force of in 
duction becomes i think perfectly clear and very instructive

the following is the import of these passages 

a “ of viviparous quadrupeds the deer roe horse mule ass 
seal and some of the swine have not the gallbladder 

the elephant also has the liver without gallbladder c’ 

£ the external parts of man are well known the internal 
parts arc far from being so the parts of man are in a great mea 
sure unknown so that we must judge concerning them by refer 
ence to tbe analogy of other animals 

c somc animals are altogether destitute of gallbladder as 

the horse the mule the ass the deer the roc but in some kinds 
rt appears that some have it and some have it not as the mice kind 
and aiqpng these is man for some men appear to have a gall 
bladder on th liver and some not to have one and thus there is 
a doubt as to the species in general for those who have happened 
to examine examples of either kind hold that all the cases are of 
that kind’ 

d those of the ancients speak most plausibly who say that 
the absence of the gallblodder is the cause of long life looking 
at animals with uncloven hoof and deer for these are destitute of 
gallbladder and live a long time and further those animals in 
which the ancients had not the opportunity of ascertaining that 
they have not the gallbladder os the dolphin and the camel are 
also longlived animals” 



criticism op aristotle’s induction 

it appears from those passages that aristotle was aware that 
some persons had asserted man to have a gallbladder but that he 
also conceived this not to be universally true he may have in 
clined tc the opinion that the opposite case was the more usual 
and may have written dvopunrovt in the passage which have been 
didlussing another mistake of his is the reckoning deer among 
longlived animals 

it appears probable from the context of the passages c and

 a ll persons who have attended in any dereo to the views 
generally current of the nature of reasoning are familiar 
with the distinction of necessary truths and iriiths of ctvperience 
and few such persons or at least few students of mathematics 
require to have this distinction explained or enforced all geome 
tricians are satisfied that the geometriciil truths with which they 
are conversant are necessarily true they not only are true but 
they must bo true the neaning of the terms being understood 
and tho proof being gone through the truth of the proposition 
inust be assented to that parallelograms upon the same base and 
between the same parallels arc equal — that angles in the same 
segment are equal j —these are propositions which we learn to be 
true by demonstrations deduced from definitions and axioms and 
which when we have thus learnt them we se could not bejothcr 
wisq on the other hand there are other truths which we learn 
from experience as for instance that the stars revolve round the 
pole in one day and that the moon goes through her phases from 
full to full again in thirty days these truths we see to be true 
but wd know them only by experience men never could have 
discovered tbfm without looking at the stars and the moon and 
having so learnt them still no one will pretend to say that they are 
necesearily true for aught we can see things might have been 
otherwise and if we had been placed in another part of the solar 
system then accordinto the opinions of astronomers experience 
would have presented them otherwise 

 i take the astronomical truths of experience to contrast with 
the geometrical necessary truths as being both of a familiar defi 
nite sort we may easily find other examples of both kinds of tnith 
the truths which regard numbers are necessary truths it is a 
necessary truth that and are equal to g that half the sum 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy 

of two numbers added to half their difference is equal to the 
greater number on the other hand that sugar will dissolve in 
water that plants cannot live without light and in short the 
whole body of our knowledge in chemist physiology and the 
other inductive sciences consists of truths of experience if there 
be any science which offer to us truths of an ambiguous kind with 
regard to which we may for a moment doubt whether they are 
necessary or experiential we willdefer the consideration of tliem 
till we have marked the distinction of the two kinds mre clearly 

 one mode in which we may express the difference of necessary 
truths and truths of experience is that necessary truths are those 
of which we cannot distinctly conceive the contrary nv e can very 
readily conceive the contrary of experiential truths wo can 
conceive the stars moving about tlie polo or across the sky in any 
kind of curves with any velocities we can conccjvc the moon 
always appearing during the whole month as a luminous disk as 
she might do if her light were inherent and not borrowed but 
we cannot conceive one of the parallelograms on the same base 
and between the same parallels larger than the other for wo 
tiiid that if we attempt to do this when vc separate the paral 
lelograms into parts wo have to conceive one triangle larger than 
another both having all their parts equal which we cannot 
conceive at all if avo conceive the triangles distinctly wc make 
this imp ssibility more clear by conceiving the triangles to be 
placed so that two sides of the one coincide with two sides of 
the other and it is then seen that in order to conceive tho tri 
angles unequal we ufust conceive the two bases which have the 
same extremities both ways to be different lines though both 
straight lines this it is impossible to conceive we assent to the 
impossibility as an axiom when it is expressed by saying that two 
straight lines cannot inclose u space aud thus we cannot distinctly 
conceive the contrary of the proposition just mentioned reccting 
parallelograms 

 but it is necessary in applying this distinction to bear in 
mind the terms of it that we cannot distinctly conceive the con 
trary of a necessary truth por in a certain loose indistinct way 
persons conceive the contrary of necessary geometrical truths when 
they erroneously conceive false propositions to be true thus 
hobbes erroneously held that he had discovered a means of geo 
metrically doubling the cube os it is called that is finding two 
mean proportionals between two given lines a problem which can 
not be solved by plane geometry hobbes not only proposed a 
construction for this purpose but obstinately maintained that il 



appendix e 


 

was right when it had been proved to bo wrong but then the 
discussion showed how indistinct tho geometrical conceptions of 
hobbes were for when his critics had proved that one of the lines 
in his diagram would tiot meet tho othef in the point which his 
reasoning supposed but in another point near to it he maintained 
in reply that one of these points was large enough to include 
tho other so that they might be considered as the same point 
such a mode of conceiving tho opposite of a geometrical tnith 
forms no exception to tho assercion that this opposite cannot be 
distinctly conceived 

 in liko manner tho indistinct conceptions of children and of 
rnde savages do not invalidate the distinction of necessary and ex 
periential truths children and savages mako mistakes even with 
regard to numbers and might easily happen to assert that 
and are equal to or but siirh mistakes cannot make 
such arithmetical truths cease to be necessary truths when any 
person conceives these numbers and their addition distinctly by re 
volving them into parts or in any other way he sees that their sum 
is necessarily if on the ground of the possibility of children 
and savages conceiving something different it be held that this is 
not a necessary truth it must be held on the same ground that 
it is not a necessary truth that and are equal to for children 
and savages might be found so unfamiliar with numbers as not to 
reject the assertion that and are or even that and are 
or but i suppose that no persons would on such grounds hold 
that these arithmetical truths are truths known only by expe 
rience 

 necessary truths are established as has already been said 
by demonstration proceeding from definitions and axioms accord 
ing to exact and rigorous inferences of reason truths of experi 
 ence ore collected from what we see also according to inferences 
of reason but proceeding in a less exact and rigorous mode of 
proof theformer depend upon the relations of the ideas which 
we have in our minds the latter depend upon the appearances or 
phenomena which present themselves to our senses necessary 
tmths are formed from our thougfits the elements of tho world 
within us experiential truths are collected from things the ele 
ments of the world without us the truths of experience as they 
appear to us in the external world wo call facts and when we 
are able to find among onr ideas a train which will conform them 
selves to the apparent faots we call this a theory 

 this distinction and opposition thus expressed in various 
forms as necessary nd experiential truth ideas and senses 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy 

thoughts and things theory and fact may be termed the 
fundamental antithesis of philosophy for almost all the discus 
sions of philosophers have been employed in asserting or denying 
explaining or obscuring this antithesis jt may be expressed in 
many other vtrays but is not difficult under all these different 
forms to recognize the same opposition and the same remarks 
apply to it under its various forms with corresponding modifica 
tions thus as vre have already seen the antithesis agrees with 
that of iteasoning and observation again it is identical with the 
opposition of keilcciion and sensation again sensation deals 
with objects facts involve objects and generally all things with 
out us are objects — objects of sensation of observation on the 
other hand we ourselves who thus observe objects and in whom 
sensation is may be called the subjects of sensation and observa 
lion and this distinction of subject and object is one of the most 
general ways of expressing the fundamental antithesis although 
not yet perhaps quite familiar in knglish i shall not scruple 
however to speak of the subjective and objective clement of this 
antithesis where the expressions are convenient 

 all these forms of antithesis and the familiar references to 
them which men make in all discussions show the fundamental 
and necessary character of the antithesis ave can have no know 
ledfo without ho union no philosophy without tho separation of 
the two elements we can have no knowledge except we have 
both impressions on our senses from the world without and 
thoughts from our minds within — except we attend to things and 
to our ideas — exceptpre are passive to receive imprcssions and 
active to compare combine and mould them but on the other 
hand philosophy seeks to distinguish the imprcssions of our senses 
from tho thoughts of our minds — to point out the difference of 
ideas and things — to separate the active from the passive faculties 
of our being the two elements sensations and ideas are both 
requisite to the existence of our knowledge as both matter and 
form are requisite to tho existence of a body but philosophy 
considers tho matter and the form separately the properties of 
the form are the subject of geouijetry the properties of the matter 
are the subject of chemistry or mechanics 

 but though philosophy considers these elements of know 
ledge separately they cannot really be separated any more than 
can matter and form wo cannot exhibit matter without form or 
form without matter and just as little can we exhibit sensations 
without ideas or ideas without sensations — the passive or the 
active faculties of tho mind detached from eac other

in ercry act of my knowledgo there must be concerned the 
things whereof i know and thoughts of me who know i must 
botli passwely receive or have received imprcssiona and must 
actively combine them nd reason on them no apprehension of 
things is purely ideal no experience of external things is purely 
sensational if they be conceived as things the mind roust have 
been awakened to the conviction of things by sensation if they be 
conceived as things the expressions of the senses must have been 
bound together by conceptions if we think of any thing we must 
recognize the existence both of thoughts and of things the 
fundamental antithesis of philosophy is an antithesis of inseparable 
ekments 

 not only cannot these elements be separately exhibited but 
they cannot bo separately conceived and described the descrip 
tion of them must always imply their relation and the names by 
which they are denoted will consequently always bear a relative 
significance and thus the terms which denote the fundamental an 
iithesis of philosophy cannot he applied absolutely and exclusively 
in any case ave may illustrate this by a consideration of some of 
the common modes of expressing the antithesis of which we speak 
the terms theory and fact are often emphatically used as opposed 
to each other and they arc rightly so used but yet it is im 
possible to say absolutely in any case this is a fact and not a 
theory this is a theory and not a fact meaning by theory true 
tlieory is it a fact or a theory that the stars appear to revolve 
round the pole is it a fact or a theory that the earth is a globo 
revolving round its axis is it a fact or p theory that the earth 
revolves round the sun is it a fact or a theory that the sun 
attracts the earth is it a fact or a theory that a loadstone attracts 
a needle in all these cases some persons would answer one way 
and some persons another a person who has never watched the 
stars nd has only seen them from time to time considers their 
circnlar motipn round the pole os a theory just as ho considers the 
motion of the sun in the ecliptic as a theory or the apparent 
motion of the inferior planets round the sun in the zodiac a 
person who has compared the measures of different parts of the 
earth and who knows that these measures cannot be conceived dis 
tinctly without supposing the earth a globe considers its globular 
form a fact just as much as the square form of his chamber a 
person to whom the grounds of believing the earth to revolve round 
its axis and round the snn are as familiar ar the grounds for be 
lieving the movements of the mailcoaches in this country con 
ceives the former ents to be facts just as steadily os the flatter 



rundamentalantithesis of philosophy 

and a person who believing the fact of the earth’s annual motion 
refers it distinctly to its mechanical course conceives the sun’s 
attraction os a fact jnst as he conceives os a fact the action of the 
wind which turns the sails of a mill weee then that in these 
cases we cannot apply absolutely and exclusively either of the terms 
fact or theory theory and fact are the elements which cor 
respond to our ideas and our senses the facts are facts so far as 
the ideas have been combined with the sensations and absorbed 
in them the theories are theorrcs so far a the ideas are kept 
distinct from the sensations and so far as ii is considered as still 
a question whether tliey can be made to agree with them a true 
theory is a fact a fact is a familiar theory 

in like manner if we take the terms reasoning and observa 
tion at first sight thev appear to be very distinct our observa 
tion of the world witiiout us our reasonings in our own minds 
appear to he clearly separated and opposed but yet we shall find 
that we cannot apply these terms absolutely and exclusively see 
a book lying a few feet from me is this a matter of observeation 
at first perhaps we might be inclined to say that it clearly is so 
but yet all of us who have paid any attention to the process of 
vision and to the mode in which we are enabled to judge of the 
distance of objects and to judgo them to be distant objects at all 
know that this judgment involves inferences drawn from various 
sensations from the impressions on our two eyes — from our 
muscular sensations and the like these inferences are of the 
nature of reasoning ns much os when we judge of the distance 
of an object on the oihc side of a river by looking at it from differ 
ent points and stepping the distance between them or again we 
observe the setting sun illmninatc a gilded weathercock but this is 
us much a matter of reasoning as when wo observe the phases 
of the moon and infer that she is illuminated by the sun all ob 
servation involves inferences and inference is reasoning • 

 even the simplest terms by which the antithesis expressed 
cannot be applied ideas and sensations thoughts and things sub 
ject and object cannot inny case be applied absolutely and ex 
clusively our sensations reqiffre ideas to bind them together 
namely ideas of space time number and the like if not 
bound together sensations do not give us any apprehension of 
things or objects all things all objects must exist in space and 
in time — must be one or many now space time number are not 
sensations or things they are something different from and op 
posed to sensations and things we have termed them ideas it 
may be said they are relations of things orof sensations bat

granting this form of expression still a relation is not a thing 
or a sensation and therefore we must still have another and 
opposite element along with our sensations and yet though 
wo have thus these tws elements in every act of perception wo 
cannot designate any portion of the act as absolutely and exclu 
sively belonging to one of the elements perception involves sen 
sation along with ideas of time space and the like or if any 
one prefers the expression involves sensations along with the ap 
prehension of relations perception is sensation along with such 
ideas as make sensation into an apprehension of things or objects 

 and as perception of objects implies ideas as observation 
implies reasoning so on the other hand ideas cannot exist where 
sensation has not been reasoning cannot go on when there has not 
been previous observation this is erider from the necessary 
order of development of the human faculties sensation necessa 
rily exists from the first moments of our existence and is constantly 
at work observation begins before we can suppose the exist 
ence of any reasoning which is not involved in observation hence 
ut whatever period we consider our ideas we must consider them 
as having been already engaged in connecting our sensations and 
as inoditied by this eniploynient by being so employed our ideas 
are unfolded and defined and such development and definition 
cannot be separated from the ideas themselves wo cannot con 
ceive space without boundaries or forms now forms involve sen 
sations we caunt conceive time without events which mark 
the course of time but events involve sensations we cannot 
conceive number without conceiving tiling which are nnnibcrod 
and ihings imply sensations and the forms things events which 
are thus implied in our ideas having been the objects of sensa 
tion constantly in every part of our life have modiiied unfolded 
and fixed our ideas to an extent which wo cannot ostiinato but 
which sve must suppose to be essential to the processes which at 
present go n in our minds wo cannot say that objects create 
ideas for to perceive objects we must already have ideas but wo 
may say that objects and the constiynt petception of objects have so 
far modified our ideas that we cannot even in thought separate 
our ideas from the perception of objects 

we cannot say of any ideas as of the idea of space or time or 
number that they are absolutely and exclusively ideas we cannot 
conceive what space or time or number would be in our minds 
if we hod never perceived any thing or things in space or time 
we cannot conceive ourselves in such a condition as never to have 
perceived any thing or things in space or time but on the other 



fundamextaf antithesis op philosophy 

hand just as little can we conceive ourselves becoming acquainted 
with space and time or numbers as objects of sensation we can 
not reason without having the operations of our minds affected by 
previous sensations but we cannot conceive reasoning to be merely 
a series of sensations in order to be used in reasoning sensa 
tion must become observation and as we have seen observation 
already involves reasoning in order to be connected by our ideas 
sensations must be things or objects and things or objects already 
include ideas and thus as we have said none of the terms by 
which the fundamental antithesis is expressed can be absolutely 
and exclusively applied 

 x now proceed to make one or two remarks suggested by 
the views which have thus been presented and first i remark 
that since as we have just seen none of the terms which express 
the fundamental antithesis can be applied absolutely and exclu 
sively the absolute application of the antithesis in any particular 
case can never be a conclusive or immoveable principle this 
remark is the more necessary to be borne in mind as the terms of 
this antithesis are often used in a vehement and peremptory man 
ner thus we arc often told that such a thing is a fact and not a 
tlieory with all the emphasis which in speaking or writing tone 
or italics or capitals can give we see from what has been said 
that when this is urged before we can estimate the truth or the 
value of the asscrtioti we must ask to whom is it a fact what 
habits of thought what previous information what ideas does it 
imply to conceive the fact as a fact does not the apprehension 
of tho fact imply asaimptions vvhich may with equal justice be 
called theory and which are perhaps false theory in which case 
the fact is no fact did not the ancients assert it as a fact that tho 
earth stood still and the stars moved and can any fact have 
stronger apparent evidence to justify persons in asserting it empha 
tically than this had these remarks ore byno means ifrged in 
order to show that no fact can be certainly known tibe true but 
only to show that no fact can be certainly shown to be a fact 
merely by calling it a fa however emphatically there is by no 
moans any ground of general skepticism with regald to truth 
involved in the doctrine of the necessary combination of two ele 
ments in all our knowledge on the contrary ideas are requisite 
to the essence and things to the reality of our knowledge in every 
case the proportions of geometry and arithmetio are examples of 
knowledge respecting our ideas of space and number with regard 
to which there is no room for doubt the doctrines of astronomy 
are examples of truths not less certain respeoting the external world 



 


appendix e 


 i remark further that since in every act of knowledge 
observation or perception both the elements of the fundamental 
antithesis are involved and involved in a manner inseparable even 
in our conceptions it nfhst always be possible to derive one of these 
elements from the other if we are satisfied to aceept as proof of 
such derivation that one always coexists with and implies the 
other thus an opponent may say that our ideas of space time 
and number are derived from oj sensations or perceptions because 
we never w ere in a condition in which we had the ideas of space 
and time and had not sensations or perceptions but then we 
may repl to this that we no sooner perceive objects than we per 
ceive them as existing in space and time and therefore the ideas of 
space and time are not derived from the perceptions in the same 
manner an opponent may say that all knowledge which is involved 
in our reasonings is the result of experience for instance our 
knowledge of geometry for every geometrical principle is pre 
sented to us by experience as true beginning with the simplest 
from which all others are derived by processes of exact reasoning 
but to this we reply that experience cannot bo the origin of such 
knowledge for though expcrienco shows that such principles are 
true it cannot show that they must be true which we also know 
we never have seen as a matter of observation two straight lines 
inclosing a space but we venture to say further without tfie 
smallest hesitation that wo never shall see it and if any one were 
to tell iis that according to his experience such a form was often 
seen we should only suppose that he did not know what ho was 
talking of no number of acts of experieifco can add to the cer 
tainty of our knowledge in this respect which shows that oiur 
knowledge is not made up of acts of experience wo cannot test 
such knowledge by experience for if wo were to try to do so we 
must first know that the lines with which we make the trial are 
straight and wo have no test of straightness better than this that 
two such lies cannot inclose a space since then experience can 
neither destroy add to nor test our axiomatic knowledge such 
knowledge cannot be derived fromexpeaence since no one act of 
experience can affect our knowledge no numbers of acta of expe 
rience can make it 

 to tliis a reply has been offered that it is a characteristic 
property of geometric forms that the ideas of them exactly resemblo 
the sensations so that these ideas are as fit subjects of experi 
mentation as the realities themselves and that by such experi 
meiitation we learn the truth of the axioms of geometry might 
very reasonably ask thosewbo use this language to explain how a 



fundamental antithesis op philosophy 

particular class of ideas can be said to resemble sensations how if 
they do we can hnow it to be so how we can prove this resem 
blance to belong to geometrical ideas and sensations and how it 
comes to be an especial characteristic of tle bat i will put the 
argument in another way experiment can only show what is 
not what must be if experimentation on ideas shows what must 
be it is different from what is commonly called experience 

 may add that not only the mre use of our senses cannot show 
that the axioms of geometry must be true but that without the 
light of our ideas it cannot even show that they are true if we 
had a segment of a circle a mile long and an inch wide we should 
have two lines inclosing a space but we could not by seeing or 
touching any part of either of them discover that it was a bent line 

ig that mathematical truths arc not derived from experience 
is perhaps still more evident if greater evidence be possible in the 
case of numbers we assert that and are we find it so if 
we try with counters or in any other way but we do not on that 
account say that the knowledge is derived from experience we 
refer to our conceptions of seven of eight and of addition and as 
soon as we possess these conceptions distinctly we see that the 
sum must be fifteen we cannot be said to make a trial for we 
should not believe the apparent result of the trial if it were different 
if any one were to say that the multiplication table is a table of 
the results of experience wc should know that he could not be 
able to go along with us in our researches into tiie foundations of 
human knowledge nor indeed to pursue with success any specu 
lations on tlio subject 

 attempts have also been made to explain the origin of 

axiomatic truths by referring them to the association of ideas but 
this is one of the cases in which the word association has been 
applied so widely and loosely that no sense can be attached to it 
those who have written with any degree of distinctness on the 
subject have truly taught that the habitual associatijh of the ideas 
leads us to believe a connexion of the things but they have never 
told us that this association gave us the power of forming the ideas 
association may determine belief but it cannot determine the pos 
sibility of oar conceptions the african king did not believe that 
water could become solid because he had never seen it in that 
state but that accident did not make it impossible to conceive it 
so any more than it is impossible for us to conceive frozen quick 
silver or melted diamond or liquefied air which we may never 
have seen but have no difficulty in conceiving if there were a 
tropical philosopher really incapable of conceiving water solidified 



 


appendix b 


he must have been brought into that mental condition by abstruse 
bpeculations on the necessary relations of solidity and fluidity not 
by the association of ideas 

 to return to the results of the nature of the fundamental 
antithesis as by assuming unirersal and indissoluble connexion 
of ideas tvith perceptions of knotvledge with experience as an 
evidence of derivation we may assert the former to be derived from 
the latter so might we on the sane ground assert the latter to be 
derived from the former we sec all forms in space and we 
might hence assert all forms to be mere modifications of our idea 
of space we see all events happen in time and wo might hence 
assort all events to be merely limitations and boundary marks of 
our idea of time we conceive all collections of things as two or 
three or some other number it might hence be asserted that we 
have an original idea of number which is reflected in external 
things in this case as in the other we are met at once by the 
impossibility of this being a complete account of our knowledge 
our ideas of space of time of number however distinctly reflected 
to us with limitations and modifications must be reflected limited 
and modified by something diflvrent from themselves we must 
have visible or tangible forms to limit space perceived events to 
mark time distinguialiablo objects to exemplify number but still 
in forms and events and objects we have a knowledge which they 
themselves cannot give us for we know without attending to 
them that whatever they are they vill conform and must conform 
to the truths of geometry and arithmetic there is an ideal por 
tion in all our knowledge of the external world and if we were 
resolved to reduce all our knowledge to one yf its two antithetical 
elements we might say that all our knowledge consists in the rela 
tion of our ideas wherever there is necessary trntb there muit 
be something more than sensation can supply and the necessary 
truths f£ geometry and arithmetic show us that our knowledge of 
objects in spabe and time depends upon necessary relations of ideas 
whatever other element it may involve 

 this remark may be carried pauch further than the domain 
of geometry apd arithmetic our knowledge of matter may at first 
sight appear to be altogether derived from the senses tet we 
cannot derive from thoensea our knowledge of a truth which we 
accept as nniversally certain — namely that wo cannot by any pro 
cess add to or diminish the quantity of matter in the world this 
truth neither is nor can be derived from experience for the experi 
ments which we make to verify it presuppoae its truth when 
the philosopher was asked what was the weight of smoke he bade 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy 

the inquirer subtract the weifht of the ashes from the weight of 
the fuel every one who thinks clearly of the changes which take 
place in matter assents to the justice of this reply and this not 
because any one had found by trial that auh was the weight of tho 
smoke produced in combustion but because tho weight lost was 
assumed to have gone into some other form of matter not to have 
been destroyed when men began to use the balance in chemical 
analysis they did not prove by tryd but took for granted as self 
evident that the weight of the whole must be found in the aggre 
gate weight of the elements thus it is involved in the idea of 
matter that its amount continues unchanged in all changes which 
tiike place in its consistence this is a necessary truth and thus 
our knowledge of matter as collected from chemical experiments 
is also a modification of our idea of matter as tho material of the 
world incapable of addition or diminution 

 a similar remark may be made with regard to tho mecha 
nical properties of matter our knowledge of these is reduced in 
our reasonings to principles which we call tho laws of motion 
these laws of motion os have endeavoured to show depend 
upon the idea of cause and involve necessary truths which are 
necessarily implied in tho idea of cause — namely that every 
change of motion must have a cause — that tho effect is measured 
by the cause — that reaction is equal and opposite to action 
these principles aro not derived from experience no one i sup 
pose would derive from experience the principle that every event 
must have a cause every attempt to sec the traces of cause in 
the world assumes tfiis principle do not say that these prin 
ciples are anterior to experience for i have already i hope shown 
that neither of the two elements of our knowledge is or can be 
anterior to the other but tho two elements are coordinate in the 
development of the human mind and the ideal element may bo 
said to be the origin of our knowledge with the more fropriotj 
of the two inasmuch os our knowledge is tho relsfjion of ideas 
the other element of knowledge in which sensation is concerned 
and which embodies linats aqd defines tho necessary truths which 
express the relations of our ideas may be propefy termed ex 
perience and have in the discussion just quoted endeavoured 
to show how the principles concerning mechanical causation 
whioh have jnst stated are by observation and experiment 
limited and defined so that they become the laws of motion

and thus we see that such knowledge ia derived from ideas in 
a sense quite as general and rigorous to say the least as that 
in which it is derived from experience 

 will take anotller example of this although it is one less 
familiar and the consideration of it perhaps a little more difficult 
and obscure the objects which we find in the world for in 
stance minerals and plants are of different kinds and accord 
ing to their kinds they are called by various names by moans of 
which wc know what we mean when we speak of them the 
discrimination of these kinds of objects according to their differ 
ent forms and other properties is the business of chemistry and 
botany and this bnsiness of discrimination and of consequent 
classification has been carried on from the first periods of the 
development of the human mind by an industrious and compre 
hensive series observations and experiments the only way in 
which any portion of the task could have been effected but as the 
foundation of all this labour and as a necessary assumption during 
every part of its progress there has been in mens minds the 
principle that objects are so distinguishable by resemblances and 
differences that they may be named and known by their names 
this principle is involved in the idea of a name and without 
it no progress could have been made the principle may be 
briefly stated thus iutclligibie names of kinds are possible if 
we suppose this not to be so language can no longer exist nor 
could the business of human life go on if instead of having 
certain definite kinds of minerals gold iron copper and the like 
of which the external forms and characterl are constantly con 
nected with the same properties and qualities there were no con 
nexion between the appearance and the properties of the object 
if what seemed externally iron might turn ont to resemble lead in 
it hardness nnd what seemed to be gold daring many trials 
might at the next trial be found to be like copper not only all the 
uses of thesoiitiinerala would fail but they would not be distin 
guishable kinds of things and the names would be unmeaning 
and if this entire uncertainty as to kind find properties prevailed 
for all objects the world would no longer be a world to which lan 
guage was applicable to man thus unable to distinguish objects 
into kinds and call them by names all knowledge would be im 
possible and all definite apprehension of external objects would 
fade away into an inconceivable confusion in the very apprehen 
sion of objects as intelligibly sorted there is involved a principle 
which springs within us contemporaneous in its efficacy with out 
first intelligent perceptipn of the kinds of ihinga of which the world 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy 

consists we assume as a necessary basis of our knowledge that 
tilings are of definite kinds and the aim of chemistry botany and 
other sciences is to find marks of these kinds and along with 
these to learn their definitelydistinguishdl properties even here 
therefore where so large a portion of our knowledge comes from 
experience and observation we cannot proceed without a neces 
sary truth derived from our ideas as our fundamental principle 
of knowledge 

 what the marks arc which distinguish the constant differ 
ences of kinds of things definite marks selected from among many 
unessential appearances and what their definite properties arc 
when they are so distinguished are parts of our knowledge to 
be learnt from observation by various processes for instance 
among others by chemical analysis we find the differences of 
bodies as shown by such analysis to be of this nature — that there 
are various elementary bodies which combining in different definite 
proportions form kinds of bodies definitely different but in arriv 
ing at ibis conclusion we introduce a new idea that of elementary 
composition which is not extracted from the phenomena but sup 
plied by the mind and introduced in order to make the phenomena 
intelligible that this notion of elementary composition is not sup 
plied by the chemical phenomena of combustion mixture c as 
merely an observed fact we see from this that men had in ancient 
times performed many experiments in which elementary composition 
was concerned and had not seen the fact it never was truly seen 
till modern times and when seen it gave a new aspect to the whole 
body of known facts this idea of elementary composition then is 
supplied by the mind in order to make the facts of chemical analy 
sis and synthesis intelligible as analysis and synthesis and this 
idea being so supplied there enters into otir knowledge apng with 
it a corresponding necessary principle — that the elementary com 
position of a body determines its kind and properties vliis is 
say a principle assumed as a consequence of tlic ida of composi 
tion not a result of experience for when bodies have been divided 
into their kinds we taw for granted that the analysis of a single 
specimen may serve to deterilline the analysis of all bodies of the 
same kind and without this assumption chemical knowledge with 
regard to the kinds of bodies would not be possible it has been 
said that we take only one experiment to determine the composition 
of any particular kind of body because we have a thousand experi 
ments to determine that bodies of the same kind have the same 
coinposition but this is not so our belief in the principle that 
bodies of the same kiud have the same composition is not established 



appendix e 


 

by experiments but is assumed as a necessary consequence of the 
ideas of kind and of composition if in our experiments wo 
found that bodies suposed to be of the same kind had not tlie same 
composition wo should hot at all doubt of the principle just stated 
but conclude at once that the bodies were not of the same kind — 
that tho marks by which the kinds are distinguished had been 
wrongly stated this is what has very frequently happened in the 
course of the investigations of chemists and mineralogists and 
thus we have it not as an experiential fact but as a necessary 
principle of chemical philosophy that the elementary composition 
of a body determines its kind and properties 

 how bodies differ in their elementary composition experi 
ment must teach us as we have already said that experiment has 
taught us but as we have also said whatever be the nature of 
this difference kinds must be dehnito in order that language may 
be possible and hence whatever be the terms in which we aro 
taught by experiment to express the elementary composition of 
bodies the result must be conformable to this principle that tho 
differences of elementary composition aro definite the law to 
which we are led by experiment is that the elements of bodies 
continue in definite proportious according to weight experiments 
add other laws as for instance that of multiple proportions in 
different kinds of bodies composed of the same elements but of 
these we do not heo speak 

 we are thus led to see that in our knowledge of mechanics 
chemistry and the like there ore involved certain necessary princi 
ples derived from our ideas and not from experience but to this 
it may be objected that the parts of our knowledge in which these 
principles are involved has in historical fact all been acquired by 
cxperieice the laws of motion tho doctrine of definite propor 

tions and the like have all become known by experiment and 
observaon and so far from being seen as necessary truths have 
been discoveid by longcontinued labours and trials and through 
innumerable vicissitudes of confusion error and imperfect truth 
this is perfectly true but does not at al disprove what has been 
said perception of external objeofs and experience experiment 
and observation are needed not only as we have said to supply the 
objective element of au knowledgeto embody limit define and 
modify our ideas but this intercourse with objeots is also requisite 
to unfold and fix our ideas themselves as we have already said 
ideas and facts can never be separated our ideas cannot be exer 
cised and developed in any other form than in their combination 
with facts and therefore the trials corrections controversies by 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy 

which the matter of our knowledge is collected is also the only way 
in which the form of it can be riglitly fashioned experience is 
requisite to the clearness and distinctness of our ideas not because 
they are derived from experience but bcause they can only be 
exercised upon experience and this consideration suibciently ex 
plains how it is that experiment and observation have been the 
means and the only means by which men have been led to a 
knowledge of the laws of nature in reality however the neces 
sary principles which flow from oftr ideas and which are the basis 
of such knowledge have not only been incttably assumed in the 
course of such investigations but have been often expressly pro 
mulgated in words by clearminded phiosoihers long before their 
true interpretation was assigned by experiment this has happened 
with regard to such principles as those above mentioned that every 
event must have a cause that reaction is equal and opposite to 
action that the quantity of matter in the world cannot be in 
creased or diminished and there vould be no dilhculty in finding 
similar enunciations of the other principles above mentioned — 
that the kinds of things have definite differences and that these 
differences depend upon their elementary composition in general 
however it may bo allowed that the necessary principles which 
are involved in those laws of nature of which we have a knowledge 
become then only clearly known when the laws of nature are dis 
covered which thus involve the necessary ideal element 

 but since this is allowed it may be further asked how we 
are to distinguish between the necessary principle which is derived 
from our ideas and tiio law of nature which is learnt by experience 
and to this wo reply that the necessary principle may be known by 
the condition vhich we have already mentioned ns belonging to such 
principles that it is impossible distinctly to conceive the contrary 
ave cannot conceive an event without a cause except we abandons 
all distinct idea of cause we cannot distinctly conceive twq straight 
lines inclosing space and if we seem to conceive is it is only 
because we conceive indistinctly we cunifbt conceive and 
making or if a pern were to say that he could conceive this 
we should know that he wasa person of immature or rude or be 
wildered ideas whose conceptions had no distinctness and thus 
wo may take it as the mark of a necessary truth that we cannot 
conceive the contrary distinctly 

 if it be asked what is the test of distinct conception since 
it is upon the distinctness of conception that the matter depends 
we may consider what answer we should give to this question if it 
were asked with regard to the truths of geometry if we doubted 



appendix e 


 

vrhether any ono had these distinct conceptions vhioh enable him to 
see the necessary nature of geometrical truth we should inquire if 
be could understand the axioms as axioms and could follow as 
demonstratire the reasenings which are founded upon them if 
this were so we should be ready to pronounce that he had distinct 
ideas of space in the sense now supposed and the same answer 
may be giren in any other case that reasoner has distinct concep 
tions of mechanical causes who can see the axioms of mechanics as 
axioms and can follow the demdnstrations derived from them as 
demonstrations if it be said that the science as presented to him 
may be erroneously constructed that the axioms may not be axioms 
and therefore the demonstrations may be futile wc still reply that 
the same might bo said with regard to geometry and yet that the 
possibility of this does not lead as to doubt either of the truth or of 
the necessary nature of the propositions contained in euclids ele 
ments we may add further that although no doubt the authors 
of elementary boohs may be persons of confused minds who present 
as axioms what are not axiomatic truths yet that in general what 
is presented as an axiom by a thoughtful man though it may include 
some false interpretation or application of our ideas will also gene 
rally include some principle which really is necessarily true and 
which would still be involved in the axiom if it wero corrected 
so as to be true instead of false and thus we still say that if 
in any department of science a man can conceive ibtinctly at all 
there are principles the contrary of which he cannot distinctly con 
ceive and which are therefore necessary truths 

 but on this it may be asked whether tcuth can thus depend 
upon the particular state of mind of the person who contemplates 
it and whether that can be a necessary truth which is not so to all 
men and to this wc again reply by referring to geomdfcry and 
arithmetic it is plain that truths may be necessary truths which 
are not o to all men when we include men of confused and per 
plexed intellects for to such men it is not a necessary truth that 
two straight lines caffnot inclose a space or that and are 
it need not be wondered at therefore ifto such men it does not 
appear a necessary truth that reaction is equal and opposite to 
action or that the quantity of matter in the world cannot be 
increased or diminished and this view of knowledge and truth 
does not make it depend upon the state of mind of the student any 
more than geometrical knowledge and geometrioal truth by the 
confession of all depend upon that state we know that a man 
cannot have any knowledge of geometry without so much of atten 
tion to the matter of the science and so much of care in the 



fundamental antithesis op philosophy 

management of his own thoughts as is requisite to keep his ideas 
distinct and clear but we do not on that account think of main 
taining that geometrical truth depends merelj upon the state of 
the students mind we conceive that h knows it because it is 
true not that it is true because he knows it we are not surprised 
that attention and care and repeated thought should be requisite to 
the clear apprehension of truth for such care and such repetition 
are requisite to the distinctness and clearness of our ideas and yet 
the relations of these ideas and their consequences are not pro 
duced by the efforts of attention or repetition which we exert 
they are in themselves something which we may discover but 
cannot make or change the idea of space for instance which is 
the basis of geometry cannot give rise to any doubtful propositions 
what is inconsistent with the idea of space cannot be truly obtained 
from our ideas by any efforts of thought or curiosity if we blunder 
into any conclusion inconsistent with the idea of space our know 
ledge bo far as this goes is no knowledge any more than our 
observation of the external world would be knowledge if from 
haste or inattention or imperfection of sense we were to mistake 
the object which we sec before us 

 but further not only has truth this reality which makes it 
independent of our mistakes that it must be what is really con 
sistent with our ideas but also a further reality to which the 
term is more obviously applicable arising from the principle already 
explained that ideas and perceptions are inseparable for since 
when we contemplate our ideas they have been frequently em 
bodied and exemplified in objects and thus have been fixed and 
modified and since this compound aspect is that under which we 
constantly have them before us and free from which they cannot 
bo exhibited our attempts to make our ideas clear and distinct 
will constantly lead us to contemplate them as they are manifested 
in those external forms in which they are involved thus in study 
ing geometrical truth we shall be led to contemplate it as exhi 
bited in visible and tangible figures — not as if thse could be 
sources of truth but as enabling us more readily to compare the 
aspects which our ideal apied to the world of objects may 
assume and thus we have an additional indication of the reality 
of geometrical truth in the necessary possibility of its being capable 
of being exhibited in a visible or tangible form and yet even this 
test by no means supersedes the necessity of distinct ideas in order 
to a knowledge of geometrical truth for in the case of the dupli 
cation of the cube by hobbes mentioned above the diagram which 
he drew made two points appear to coincide which did not really 



appendix k 


 

and by the nature of onr idea of space coincide and thus con 
firmed him in hfs error 

thxts the inseparable nature of the fundxmmtal antithesis of 
ideas and things gives reality to our hnotoledge and makes objecm 
live reality a corrective of our subjective imperfections in the pursuit 
of knowledge but this objective exhibition of knowledge can by no 
means supersede a complete development of the subjective condition 
namely distinctness of ideas and that there is a subjective condu 
tiouj by no means makes knowledge altogether subjective and thus 
deprives it of reality because as we have said the subjective and 
the objective elements are inseparably bound together in the funda 
mental antithesis 

 it would be easy to apply these remarks to other oases for 
instance to the case of the principle we have just mentioned that 
the differences of elementary composition of different kinds of bodies 
must be definite we have stated that this principle is necessarily 
true — that the contrary proposition cannot be distinctly conceived 
but by whom evidently according to the preceding reasoning by 
a person who distinctly conceives kinds as marked by intelligible 
names and composition as determining the kinds of bodies per 
sons new to chemical and cassificatory science may not possess 
these ideas distinctly or rather cannot possess thorn distinctly 
and therefore cannot apprehend the impossibility of conceiving the 
opposite of theabovo principle just as the schoolboy cannot appre 
hend the impossibility of the numbers in his multiplication table 
being other than they are but this inaptitude to conceive in 
either case does not alter the necessary character of the truth 
although in one case the truth is obvious to all except schoolboys 
and the like and the other is probably not clear to any except those 
who have attentively studied the philosophy of elementary com 

 positions at the same time this difference of apprehension of the 
truth in different persons does not make the truth doubtful or 
dependint upon personal qualiqcations for in proportion as per 
sons attain f distinct ideas they will see the truth and cannot 
with such ideas see anything as truth which is not truth when 
the relations of elements in a compounctbecome as familiar to a 
person as the relations of factors in a multiplication table he will 
then see what are the necessary axioms of chemistry as he now sees 
the necessary axioms of arithmetic 

 there is also one other remark which i will here make in 
the progress of science both the elements of our knowledge are 
constantly expanded and augmented by the exercise of observa 
tion and experiment we have a perpetual accumulation of facts the 



fundamental antithesis of philosophy i 

materials of cnovlede the objective element bj thought and 
discussion we have a perpetual development of mans ideas going 
on theories are framed the materials of knowledge are shaped into 
form the subjective element is evolved and by the necessary 
coincidence of the objective and subjective elements the matter and 
the form the theory and the facts each of these processes furthers 
and corrects the other each element moulds and unfolds the other 
now it follows from this constant development of the ideal portion 
of our knowledge that we shall constantly lie brought in view of 
new necessary principles the expression of ihe conditions belong 
ing to the ideas which enter into onr expanding knowledge these 
principles at first dimly seen and hesitatingly asserted at last be 
come clearly and plainly selfevident such is the case with the 
principles which are the basis of the laws of motion such may 
soon be the case with the principles which arc the basis of the 
philosophy of chemistry such may hereafter be the case with 
the principles which are to be the basis of the philosophy of the 
connected and related polarities of chemistry electricity galvanism 
magnetism that knowledge is possible in these cases we know 
that our knowledge may be reduced to principles gradually more 
simple wo also know that we have reached the last stage of 
simplicity of our principles few cultivators of the subject will bo 
disposed to maintain and that the additional steps which lead 
towards very simple and general principles will also lead to prin 
ciples which recommend themselves by a kind of axiomatic charac 
ter those who judge from the analogy of the past history of science 
will hardly doubt that the principles thus axiomatic in their 
form do also express some relation of our ideas of wdiich experi 
ment and observation have given a true and real interpretation 
is the doctrine which have here attempted to establish and illus 
trate in the most clear and undoubted of the existing sciences and 
the evidence of this doctrine in those cases seems to be unexcep 
tionable and to leave no room to doubt that sncli is e universal 
type of the progress of science such a doctrine as w’c have now 
seen is closely connected with the views here presented of the 
nature of the fundamental antithesis of fhilosophy which have 
endeavoured to illustrate

eemaeks on a eeview of the philo 
sophy of the inductive sciences 


trinity zudg ajtritluh 

mt dear heasciieii 

teng about to send you a copy of a paper on a philosophical 

question just printed in the transactions of our cambridge 
society am tempted to add as a private communication a few 
kemarks on another aspect of the same question these rernarkif 
i think may properly address to you they will refer to an 
article in the quarterly lieview for june respecting xny 
history and philosophy of the inductive sciences and without 
assigning any other reasoii may say that the interest i know you 
to take in speculations on such subjects makes me confident that 
you will give a reasonable attention to what may have to say od 
the subject of that article with the keviewal itself i am so far 
from haying any quarrel that when it appeared received it as 
affording all that hoped from jublic criticism the degree and 
the kind of admiration bestowed upon my works by a writer so 
familiar with science so comprehensive in his views and so equit 
able in his decisions as the reviewer manifestly was accepted 
as giving ray work a stamp of acknowledged value which few other 
hands doiild have bestowed 

you may rhaps recollect however that the reviewer dissented 
altogether from some of the general views which i had maintained 
and especially from a general view which is also in the main 
that presented in the accompanying memoir namely that besides 
facts ideas are an indispensable source of our knowledge that 
ideas are the ground of necessary truth that the idea of space in 
particular is the ground of the necessary truths of geometry this 
question and especially as limited to the last form will be the sub 
ject of my remarks in the first place and i wish to consider the 
reviewers objections with the respect which their subtlety and 
depth of thought well deserve 



remarks on a review c 

the reyiewer makes objections to the account which i haye 
given of the source whence geometrical truth derives its characters 
of being necessary and universal but he is not one of those meta 
physicians who deny those characters to tlie truths of geometry 
lie allows in the most ample manner that the truths of geometry 
art necessary the question between us tlierefore is from what 
this character is derived the reviewer prefers indeed to have it 
considered that the question is not concerning the necessity but as 
he snys the universality of these truths or laiher the nature and 
grounds of our conviction of their universality he might have 
said with equal justice the nature and grounds of our conviction 
of their necessity for liis objection to the term necessity in this 
case — that all the propositions about realities are necessarily true 
since every reality must be consistent with itself’ pg — does not 
apply to our conviction of necessity since we may not be able to 
see what are the properties of real things and therefore may have 
no conviction of their necessity it may be a necessary property of 
salt to be soluble but we sec no such necessity and therefore the 
assertion of such a property is not one of ‘the necessary truths with 
which we are here concerned but to turn back to the necessary 
or universal truths of geometry and the ground of those attributes 
the main difference between the author and the reviewer is 
brought into view wheri the reviewer discusses the general argu 
ment w’htch had used in order to show that truths which we seo 
to be necessary and universal cannot be derived from experience 
the argument is this — 

 experience must afways consist of a limited number of observa 
tions and however numerous these may be they can show nothing 
with regard to the infinite number of cases in which the experiment 
has not been made truths can only be known to be general not 
universal if they depend upon experience alone experience can 
not bestow that universality which she herself cannot have nor 
that necessity of which she has no comprehension” pfiil i pp 
go cl 

here is that which mult be considered as the cardinal argument 
on this subject it is therefore important to attend to the answer 
which the reviewer makes to it lie says— 

 we conceive that a full answer to this argument is afforded by 
the nature of the inductive propensity — by the irresistible impulse 
of the mind to generalize ad infinitum when nothing in the nature 
of limitation or opposition offers itself to the imagination and by 
our involuntary application of the law of continuity to fill up by 
the same ideal substance of truth every interval which uncontra

dieted expel ience may hae left blank in our inductive conclusion” 
p 

now here we have two rival explanations of the same thing — 
the conviction of the universality of geometrical truths the one 
explanation is that this universality is imposed upon such truths 
by their involving a certain element derived from the niiivcrgal 
mode of activity of the mind when apprehending surh truths which 
clement have termed an idea the other explanation is that this 
universality arises from the inductive propensity — from the irresist 
ible impulse to generalize ad infinitum — from the involuntary appli 
cation of the law of continuity— ieoiw the filling up all intervals with 
the same ideal substance of truth 

with regard to these two explanations i may observe that so 
far as they are thus stated they do not necessarily diiler they 
both agree in expressing this that the ground of the universality 
of geometrical truths is a certain law of the mind’s activity which 
dutei mines its procedure when it is concerned in apprehending the 
external world one explanation soys that we impress upon the 
external world the relations of onr ideas and tluis believe more 
than we see — the other says that we have an irresistible impulse 
to introduce into our conviction a relation between what we do 
observe and what we do not namely to generalize ad infinitum 
from what we do see one explanation says that we perceive all 
external objects as included in absolute ideal space — the other 
that we fill up tlie intervals of the objects which w’e perceive with 
the same ideal substance of truth both sets of expressions may 
perhaps be admissible and if admitted may be understood as ex 
pressing the same opinions or opinions which have much in com 
mon the author’s expressions have the advantage which ought 
to belong to them as the expressions employed in a systematic 
work of being fixed expressions technical phrases intentionally 
seleetetl uniformly and steadily employed wdienevcr the occasion 
recurs tli reviover’s expressions are more lively and figurative 
and such as well become an occasional composition hut imrdly 
such as could be systematically applied to the subject in a regular 
treatise we could not as a standard and technical phrase talk of 
filling np the intervals of observation with the same ideal substance 
of truth and the inevitable impulse to generalize would hardly 
sufliciently express that we generalize according to a certain idea 
namely the idea of space perhaps that which is suggested to us 
as the common import of the two sets of expressions may be con 
veyed by some other phrase in a manner free from the objections 
nrhich lie against both the author’s and the critic’s terms perhaps 



remaeks on a review c 

tlie mental idea governing our experience and the irresistible im 
pulse to generalize our observation ma both be superseded by our 
speak ing of a law of the mind’s activity which is really implied in 
both there operates in observing the acternol world a law of 
the mind’s activity by which it connects its observations and this 
law of the mind’s activity may be spoken of either as the idea of 
jpace or as the irresistible impulse to generalize the relations of 
space which it observes and this expression — the laws of the 
minds activity — thus opposed tothat merely passive function by 
which the mind receives the impressions of sense may be applied to 
other ideas as well as to the idea of space and to the impulse to 
generalize in other truths as well as those of geometry 

so far it would seem that the author and the critic may be brought 
into much nearer agreement than at first seemed likely with regard 
to the grounds of the necessity and universality in our knowledge 
but even if we adopt this conciliatory suggestion and speak of the 
ncccsbity and universality of certain truths as arising from the laws 
of the mind’s activity wc cannot without producing great con 
fusion allow ourselves to say as the critic says that these truths 
are thus derived from experience or from observation it will 
say be found fatal to all philosophical precision of thought and 
language to say that the fundamental truths of geometry the 
axioms with the conviction of their necessary truth are derived 
from experience let us take any axiomatic truth of geometry 
and ask ourselves if this is not so 

it is for example an axiom in geometry that if a straight line 
cut one of two parallel straight lines it must cut the other also 
is this truth derived or derivable from observation of actual parallel 
lines and a line cutting them exhibited to our senses let those 
who say that we do acquire this truth by observation imagine 
to themselves the mode in which the observation must be made 
we have before us two parallel straight hues and we secs that a 
straight lino which cuts the one cuts the other also s we see this 
again in another case it may be the angles and the distances being 
different and in a third and in a fourth and so on and generaliz 
ing we are irresistibly led to believe the assertion to be universally 
true but can any one really imagine this to be the mode in which 
we arrive at this truth ‘we see” says this explanation “two 
parallel straight lines cut by a third” but how do we know that 
the observed lines are parallel if we apply any test of parallelism 
we must assume some property of parallels and thus involve some 
axiom on the subject which we have no more right to assume than 
the one now under consideration we should thus destroy our 



appendix f 


 

explanation as an account of the mode of arrixing at independent 
geometrical axioms but probabiy those who would give such an 
explanation would not do this they would not suppose that in 
observing this property f parallels we try by measurement whether 
the lines are parallel they would say i conceive that we suppose 
lines to be parallel and that then we see that the straight line 
which cuts the one must cut the other that when we make this 
supposition we are persuaded of the truth of the conclusion is 
certain but what i have to remark is that this being so the con 
elusion is the result not of observation but of the hypothesis 
the geometrical truth here spoken of after this admission no 
longer flows from experience but from supposition it is not that 
we ascertain the lines to be parallel and then find that itiey have 
this property but we suppose the lines to be parallel and therefore 
they have this property this is not a truth of experience 

this it may bo said is so evident that it cannot have been over 
looked by a very acute rcasoner such as you describe your critic to 
be what it may be asked is the answer which he gives to so 
palpable an objection as this how does ho understand his asser 
tion that we learn the truth of geometrical axioms from experience 
p bo as to mako it tenable on his own principles what 
account does he give of the origin of such axioms which makes them 
in any sense to be derived from experience 

in justice to the reviewer’s fairness which is unimpeachable 
throughout his argumentation it must be stated that he does give 
an account in which he professes to show how this is done and 
the main step of his explanation consists iif introducing the con 
ception of directionj and unity of direction he says p “ tho 
unity of direction or that we cannot march from a given point by 
more than one path direct to the same object is a matter of practical 
experience long before it can by possibility become matter of ab 
stract thought” we might ask here ais in the former case how 
this can be oanatter of experience except we have some independ 
ent test of directness and we might demand to know what this 
test is or do we not rather here in the other case suppose the 
directness of the path and is not the singleness of the direct path 
a consequence not of its observed form but of its hypothetical di 
rectness and thus by no means a result of experience but we 
may put our remark upon this deduction of ttie geometricid axiom 
in another form we generalize it is said the observations which 
we have made ever since we were born but this term generalize 
is far too vague to pass for an explanation without being itself ex 
plained we are impelled to believe that to be true in general 



remarks on a review c 

which we see to be true in particular but how do we see any 
truth how do wo pick out any proposition with respect to a 
diagram which we see before us we see in particular and state 
in general some truth respecting straigh twines or parallel lines or 
concerning direction but where do we find the conception of 
straightness or parallelism or direction these conceptions are 
not upon the surface of things the child does not from his birth 
see straightness and parallelism so as to know that he sees them 
how then does his experience bbar upon a proposition in which 
these conceptions are involved it is said that it is a matter of 
experience long before it is a matter of abstract thought but how 
can there bo any experience by which we learn these properties of 
a straight line till our thoughts are at least so abstract as to con 
ceive what straightness is if it bo said that this conception grows 
with our experience and is gradually unfolded with our unfolding 
materials of knowledge so as to give import and significance to 
them i need make no objection to such a statement except this — 
that this power of unfolding out of the mind conceptions which give 
meaning to our experience is something in addition to the mere 
employment of our senses upon the external world it is what i 
have called the ideal part of our knowledge it implies not only 
an impulse to generalize from experience but also an impulse to 
form conceptions by which generalization is possible it requires 
not only that nothing should oppose the tendency but that the 
direction in which the tendency is to operate should be determined 
by the laws of the mind’s activity by an internal not by an ex 
ternal agency a 

one main ground on which the reviewer is disposed to quarrel 
with and reject several of the expressions used in tho philosophy — 
such as that space is an idea a form of our perception and tho 
like — is this that such expressions appear to deprive the externa 
world of its reality to make it or at least most of its properties a 
creation of the observing mind fle quotes the follo’ipng argument 
which is urged in the philosophy in order to prove that space is 
not a notion obtained friim experience “ experience gives us infor 
mation concerning things without us but our apprehending them 
as wiriiout us takes for granted their existence in space experience 
aciuaints us with the form position magnitude c of particular 
objects but that they have form position magnitude presupposes 
that they are in space’’ from this statement he altogether dissents 
no says he hhe reason why we apprehend things as without us is 
that they are without us we take for granted that they exist in 
space because they do so exist and because such their existence is 



appendix f 


 

a matter of direct perception which can neither be explained in 
words nor contravened in imagination because in short space is a 
realuy and not a mere matter of convention or imagination’ 

now if bv calling spfree an idea we suggest anj doubt of its 
reality and of the reality of the external world we certainly run the 
risk of misleading our readers for the external world is real if 
anything be real the bodies which exist in space are things if 
things are anywhere to be found that bodies do exist in space 
and that that is tlio reason why wo aprehend them as existing 
in space readily grant but conceive that the term idea ought 
not to suggest any such doult of the reality of the knowledge in 
which it is involved ideas are always in our knowledge conjoined 
with facts our real knowledge is knowledge because it involves 
ideas real because it involves facts wo apprehend things as ex 
isting in space because they do so exist and our idea of space 
enables us so to observe them and so to conceive them 

but we want further a reason why apprehending them as they 
are we also apprehend that in certain relations they could not be 
otherwise that two straight linear objects could not inclose a space 
for instance this circunistaneo is no way accounted for by saying 
that we apprehend them as they are and is presume to say in 
explicable except by supposing that it arises from some property 
of the observing mind an idea as have termed it — an irresis 
tible impulse to generalize as the reviewer expresses it or us 
 have suggested we may adopt a third phrase a law of the 
mind’s activity and in order that no question may remain whe 
ther we ascribe reality to the objects and rektions which we oh 
serve we may describe it as ‘a law of the mind’s activity in 
appreheikling what is” and thus the real existence of the object 
and the ideal element which our apprehension of it introduces 
vould both be clearly asserted 

 am ready to use expressions which recognize the reality of space 
and other external things more emphatically than those expressions 
which i have employed in the philosophy if expressions can be 
found which while they do this enable us lo explain the possibility 
of knowledge and to analyze the structure of truth it is indeed 
extremely difficult to find in speaking of this subject expressions 
which are satisfactory the reality of the objects which we per 
ceive is a profound apparently an insoluble problem we cannot 
but suppose that existence is something different from our know

ledge of existence — that which exists does not exist merely in our 
linuwiiij that it does— truth is truth whether we know it or not 
yet how can we conceive truth otherwise than as something known 
how can wo conceive things as existing without conceiving them 
as objects of perception ideas and things are constantly opposed 
yet necessarily coexistent how they are thus opposite and yet 
idgntica is the ultimate problem of all philosophy the successive 
jihases of philosophy have consisted in separating and again uniting 
these two opposite elements in dwelling somotimes upon the one 
and sometimes upon the other as the principal or original or only 
element and then in discovering that such an account of the stale 
of the cose was insufficient knowledge requires ideas keality 
requires things ideas and things coexist truth and is known 
but the complete explanation of these points njipears to be beyond 
our reach at least it is not necessary for the purposes of our 
philosophy the separation of ideas and sensations in order to 
discover the conditions of knowledge is our main task how ideas 
and sensations are united so as to form things docs not so imme 
diately concern us 

 have stated that we may without giving up any material por 
tion of the philosophy of science to which have been led 
express the conclusions in other phraseology and that instead of 
saying that all our knowledge involves certain fundamental ideas 
the sources from which all universal truth is derived we may ay 
that there are certain laws of mental activity according to which 
alone all the real relations of things are apprehended if this 
alteration in the phrdbeology will make the doctrines more generally 
intelligible or acceptable there is no reason why it should not be 
adopted but may remark that a main purpose of the philo 
sophy was not merely to prove that there are such fundamental 
ideas or laws of mental activity but to enumerate those of theia 
which are involved in the existing sciences and to state the funda 
mental truths to which the fundaiental ideas lead this was the 
tak which was attempted and if this have been executed with any 
tolerable success it mays perhaps be received as a contribution to 
the philosophy of science of which the value is not small in what 
ever terms it be expressed and this enumeration of fundamental 
ideas and of truths derived from them must have something to 
correspond to it in any other mode of expressing that view of the 
nature of knowledge which we ore led to adopt if instead of 
fundamental ideas we speak of impulses of generalization or of 
zaws of nental activity we must still distinguish such impulses 
or such laws according to the distinctions of ideas to which tha

survey of scienco led us we shftll thus have a series of groups of 
laws or of classes of generalizing impulses corresponding to the 
series of fundamental ideas already given if we employ the 
language of the reviewer we shall we one generalizing impulse 
which suggests relations of space another which directs ns to 
properties of numbers another which deals with time another 
with cause another which groups objects according to ykeness 
another which suggests a purpose as a necessary relation among 
them to which may be added even while we confine ourselves to 
the physical sciences several others as may be seen in the philo 
sophy now when the fundamental conditions and elements of 
truth are thus arranged into groups it is not a matter of so much 
consequence to decide whether each group shall be said to be bound 
together by an idea or by an impulse of generalization as it is to 
see that if this happen in virtue of ideas here are so many distinct 
ideas which enter into the structure of science and give universality 
to its matter and again if this happen in virtue of an irresistible 
impulse of generalization in each case wo have so many different 
kinds of impulses of generalization the main purpose in the 
philosophy was to analyze scientific truth into its conditions and 
elements and did not content myself with saying that those ele 
ments are sensations and ideas the ideas being that element 
which makes universal knowledge conceivable and possible i went 
further enumeinted the ideas which thus enter into science i 
showed that in the sciences which passed in review the most 
acute and profound inquirers had taken for granted that certain 
truths in each science are of universal and ntoesaary validity and 
 endeavoured to select the idea in which this universality and 
necessity resided and to separate it from all other ideas involved 
in other sciences if therefore it be thought better to say that those 
frinciples in each science upon which as upon the axioms in geo 
metry tho universality and necessity of scientihe truth depends are 
arrived at noijthy ideas but by ail irresistible impulse of generali 
zation those who employ such phraseology if they make a classifi 
cation of such impulses corresponding to mf classification of ideas 
will still adopt the greater port of m philosophy altering only the 
phraseology or if as suggested instead of fundamental 
ideas we use the phrase ‘‘laws of mental activity then our 
primary intellectual codethe constitution of our minds as it 
may be termed— will consist of a body of laws of which the titles 
correspond with the fundamental ideas of the philosophy 

my object was from the writings of the most sagacious and pro 
found philosophers who have laboured on each science to extract 



remarks on a review c 

such a code such a constitution if i have in anj degree succeeded 
in this the result must hajre a reality and a value independently of 
all forms of expression still i do not think that any language can 
ever serve for such legislation in which ie two elements of truth 
are not distinguished even if we adopt the phraseology which i 
have just employed we shall have to recollect that law and fact 
must be kept distinct and that the constitution has its principles 
as well as its history 

but i will not longer detain yhu by seeking other modes of ex 
pressing the fundamental antithesis to which the accompanying

ideas enter into theif respective sciences namely by the statement 
or use of axioms which involve the ideas and which form the basis 
of each science when systematically exhibited a number of these 
axioms belonging to most of the physical sciences are stated in the

cam phil soc may 


 history of scicnco suprests the reflection that it is very 

lifficuu for the same person at the same time to do justice 
to two conflicting theories take for example the cartesian hypo 
thesis of vortices and the newtonian doctrine of universal gravi 
tation the adherents of tlie earlier opinion resisted the evidence 
of the newtonian theory with a degree of obstinacy and captious 
neas which now appears to ui quite marvellous while on the other 
hand since the complete triumph of the newtonians they have 
been unwilling to allow any merit at all to the doctrine of vortices 
it cannot but sceiu strange to a calm observer of such changes 
that in a matter which depends upon mathematical proofs the 
whole body of the mathematical world should pass over as in this 
and similar cases they seem to have done fbom an opinion con 
fidently held to its opposite no doubt this must be in part 
ascribed to the lasting effects of education and early prejudice 
the old opinion passes away with the old generation the new 
theory grows to its full vigour when its congenital disciples grow 
to be masters john bernoulli continues a cartesian to the last 
daniel his soqi is a newtonian frfim the first newton’s doctrines 
are adopted at once in england for they are the solution of a pro 
blem at which his contemporaries have bei labouring for years 
they find no adherents in france whhre descartes is supposed to 
have already explained the constitution of the world and fon 
tenelle the secretary of tho academy of sciences at paris dies a 
cartesian seventy years after the publication of newtons principia 
this is no doubt a part of the explanation of the pertinacity with 
which opinions are held both before and after a scientific revolu 
tion but this is not the whole nor perhaps the most instructive 
aspect of the subject there is another feature in the change 



transformation op hypotheses c 

which explains in some degree how it is possible that in subjects 
mainly at least mathematical and therefore claiming demonstrative 
evidence mathematicians should hold different and even opposite 
opinions and the object of the prescntaper is to point out this 
feature in the successions of theories and to illustrate it by some 
prominent examples drawn from the history of science 

 the feature to which i refer is this that vidien a prevalent 

theory is found to be untenable and consequently is succeeded by 
a different or even by an opposite one the change is not made 
suddenly or completed at once at least in the minds of the most 
tenacious adherents of the earlier doctrine but is effected by a 
transformation or series of transformations of the earlier hypo 
thesis by means of which it is gradually brought nearer and 
nearer to the second and thus the defenders of tite ancient doc 
trine are able to go on as if still asserting their tirst opinions and 
to continue to press their points of advantage if they have any 
against the new theory they borrow or imitate and in some 
way accommodate to their original hypothesis tlie new explana 
tions which the new theory gives of the observed facta and lliiis 
they maintain a sort of verbal consistency till the original hypo 
thesis becomes inextricably confused or breaks down under the 
weight of tlio auxiliary hypotheses thus fastened upon it in order 
to make it consistent with the facts 

tliis oftenoccurring course of events might be illustrated from 
the history of the astronomical theory of epicycles and eccentrics 
as is well known but my present purpose is to give one or two 
brief illustrations of somewhat similar tendency from other parts 
of scientific history and in tiic first place from that part which 
has already been referred to the battle of the cartesian and new 
tonian systems 

 the part of the cartesian system of vortices which is mo 
familiarly known to general readers is the explanation of the motiotis 
of the planets by supposing themcarried round tho ajn by a kind of 
whirlpool of fluid matter in which tliey are immersed and the ex 
planation of the motioss of the satellites round their primaries by 
similar subordinate whirlpools turning round the primary and 
carried along with it by tho primary vortex but it should be 
borne in mind that a part of the cartesian hypothesis which was 
considered quite as important as the cosmical explanation was the 
explanation which it was held to afford of terrestrial gravity ter 
restrial gravity was asserted to arise from the motion of the vortex 
of subtle matter which revolved round the earth’s axis and filled 
the surrounding space it was maintained that by the rotation of 



 


appendix g 


such a tortex the particles of the subtle matter would exert a 
centrifugal forcej and by virtue of that force tend to recede from 
the center and it was held that all bodies which were near the 
earth and therefore immersed in the vortex would be pressed to 
wards the center by the effort of the subtle matter to recede from 
the center 

these two assumed effects of the cartesian vortices — to carry 
bodies iu their stream as straws are carried round by a whirlpool 
and to press bodies to the center by the centrifugal effort of the 
whirling matter — must be considered separately because they were 
modified separately as the progress of discussion drove the carte 
sians from point to point the fornmr effect indeed the dragging 
force of the vortex as we may call it would not bear working out 
oil mechanical principles at all for as soon as the law of motion 
was acknowledged which descartes himself was cue of the loudest 
in proclaiming that a body in motion keeps all the motion which it 
has and receives in addition all that is impressed upon it as soon 
in short as philosophers rejected the notion of an inertness in 
matter which constantly retards its movements — it was plain that 
a planet perpetually dragged onwards in its orbit by a fluid moving 
quicker than itself must be perpetually accelerated and therefore 
could not follow those constantlyrecurring cycles of quicker and 
 loweimotion which the planets exhibit to us 

the cartesian mathematicians then left untouch d the calcu 
lation of the progressive motion of the planets and clinging to 
the assumption that a vortex would produce a tendency of bodies 
to the center made various successive efforki to construct their 
vortices in such a manner that the centripetal forces produced by 
them should coincide with those which the phenomena required 
and therefore of course in the end with those which the newtoniaii 
theory asserted 

la trah the cartesian vortex was a bad piece of machinery fur 
producing a citral force from the first objections were made to 
the sufficiency of its mechanism and most of these objections were 
very unsatisfactorily answered even granting the additional machi 
nery which its defenders demanded sjne formidable objection was 
soon started and continued to the last to be the torment of the 
cartesians if terrestrial gravity it was urged arise from the 
centrifugal force of a vortex which revolves about the earths axis 
terrestrial gravity ought to act in planes perpendicular to the

teassformation of hypotheses c 

earths axi instead of tending to the earths center this oiijec 
tiun was taken by james bernoulli and by huygliens not long 
after the publication of descartess prindpia huyghens who 
adopted the theory of vortices with modiacations of his own sup 
poses that there are particles of the fluid matter which move about 
the earth in every possible direction within the spherical space 
which includes terrestrial objects and that the greater part of 
these motions being in spherical surfaces concentric with the earth 
produces a tendency towards theearth center 

this was a procedure tolerably arbitrary but it was the best 
which could be done saurin a little later gave nearly the same 
solution of this difficulty the solution identifying a vortex of 
some kind with a central force made the hypotliesis of vortices 
applicable wherever central forces existed but then in return it 
deprived the image of a vortex of all that clearness and simplicity 
wliich had been its first great recommendation 

but still there remained difficulties not less formidable accord 
ing to this explanation of gravity since the tendency of bodies to 
the earths center arose from the superior centrifugal force of the 
whirling matter which pushed them inward as water pushes a light 
body upward bodies ought to tend more strongly to tlie center in 
proportion as they are less dense the rarest bodies should be the 
heaviest contrary to what we find 

descartess original solution of this difficulty has a certain degree 
of ingenuity according to him princip v a terrestrial body 
consists of particles of the third clement and the more it has of such 
particles the inoresit excludes the parts of the celestial matter 
from the revolution of which matter gravity arises and therefore 
the denser is ihe terrestrial body and the heavier it will be 

but though this iiiiglit satisfy him it could not satisfy the matho 
maticians who followed him and tried to reduce his system tft 
calculation on mechanical principles jfor how could th do this 
if the celestial matter by the opillration of which thmphenomcna of 
force and motion w’ere produced watf so entirely ditferent from

illustrations of mechanical principles in order that the celestial 
 matter by its whirling might produce the gravity of heavy bodies 
it was mechanically necessary that it must be very dense and dense 
in the ordinary sense of the term for it was by regarding density 
in the ordinary sense of the term that the mechanical necessity had 
been established 

the cartesians tried to escape this result ituyghens pesantcur 
p and john ilcrnoulli nouvelles pensees art by saying 
that there were two meanings of density and rarity that sonic 
fluids might be rare by having their particles far asunder others by 
having their particles very small though in contact but it is diffi 
cult to think that they could as persons well acquainted with 
mechanical principles satisfy themselves with this distinction for 
they could hardly fail to see that the mechanical eft’ect of any por 
tion of fluid depends upon the total mass moved not on the size of 
its particles 

attempts made to exemplify the vortices experimentally only 
showed more clearly the force of this difficulty iluyghens bad 
found that certain bodies immersed in a whirling fluid tended to 
the center of the vortex but when saulmou a little later made 
similar experiments he had ihe mortification of finding that tho 
heaviest bodies had the greatest tendency to recede from the axis 
of the vortex the result is’ as the secretary of the academy 
fontenelle says exactly the opposite of what wc could have 
wished for the cartesian system of gravity but wc are not to 
despair sometimes in such researches disappointment leads to ulti 
male success” 

but passing by this difficulty aud aisuming that in some way or 
otlier a centripetal force arises from the centrifugal force of the 
vortex the cartesian mathematicians were naturally led to calcu 
vite the circumstances of the vortex on mechanical principles espe 
cially huyghens who had successfully studied tho subject of centri 
fugal force accordingly in hi little treatise on the cause of 
gravitation p be calculates the velocity of ihe fluid matter of 
the vortex and finds that at a point in tlp equator it is times 
the velocity of the earth’s rotation 

it may naturally be asked how it comes to pass that a stream of 
fluid dense enough to produce the gravity of bodies by its centri 
fugal force moving with a velocity times that of the earth and 
therefore moving round tho earth in minutes does not sweep

transformation of hypotheses c 

oil terrestrial objects before it but to this hnjghens had already 
replied p that there are particles of the fluid moving in all 
directions f and therefore that they neutralize each other’s action so 
far as lateral motion is concerned • 

and thus as early as this treatise of huyghens that is in three 
years from the publication of newton’s principuiy a vortex is made 
to mean nothing more than some machinery or other for producing 
i central force and this is so much the case tat huyghens com 
mends p as confirming histwn calculation of the velocity of 
his vortex newton’s proof that at the moon’s orbit the centripetal 
force is equal to the centrifugal and that thus this force is less 
than the centripetal force at the earth’s surface in the inverse pro 
portion of the squares of the distances 

john bernoulli in the same manner but with far less clearness 
and less candour has treated the hypothesis of vortices as being 
principally a hypothetical cause of central force ito had repeated 
occasions given him of propounding his inventions for propping up 
the cartesian doctrine by the subjects proposed for prizes by the 
paris academy of sciences in which competition cartesian specu 
lations were favourably received thus the subject of the prize 
hissays for was the explanation of the elliptical form of the 
planetary orbits and of the motion of their aphelia and the prize 
was assigned to john bernoulli who gave the explanation on car 
tesian principles be explains the elliptical figure not os descartes 
himself bad done by supposing the vortex wdiich carries the planet 
round the sun to be itself sipieczed into an elliptical form by the 
pressure of contiguoiti vortices but he supposes the planet while 
it is carried round by the vortex to have a limited oscillatory 
motion to and from the center produced by its being originally 
not at the distance at which it would float in equilibrium in the 
vortex but above or below that point on this supposition the® 
planet would oscillate to and from the center bernoulli says like 
the mercury when deranged in a barometer and it isevident that 
such an oscillation combined with a motion round the center 
might produce an oval cjirve either with a fixed or with a move 
able aphelion all this howeter merely amounts to a possibility 
that the oval may be an ellipse not to a proof that it will be so 
nor does bernoulli advance further 

it was necessary that the vortices should be adjusted in such 
a manner as to account for kepler’s laws and this was to be done 
by making the velocity of each stratum of the vortex depend in 
a suitable manner on its radius the abbd de molieres attempted 
this on the supposition of elliptical vortices but could not reconcile

keplers first two laws of equal elljptlcal areas in equal times with 
his third law that the squares of the periodic times are as the cubes 
of the mean distances bernoulli with his circular vortices could 
accommodate the velocities at different distances so that they should 
explain keplers laws he pretended to prove that newtons in 
vestigations respecting vortices in the ninth section of the second 
book of the principia were mechanically erroneous and in truth 
it must bo allowed that besides several arbitrary assumptions there 
are some errors of reasoning in tliem but for the most part the 
more enlightened cartesians were content to accept newtons ac 
count of the motions and forces of the solar system as part of their 
scheme and to say only that the hypothesis of vortices explained 
the origin of the newtonian forces and that thus theirs was a 
philosophy of a higher kind thus it is asserted mem acad 
that m de molicres retains the beautiful theory of newton en 
tire only he renders it in a sort less newtonian by disentangling 
it from attraction and transferring it from n vacuum into a plenum 
this plenum though not its native region frees it from the need of 
attraction which is all the better for it these points were the 
main charms of the cartesian doctrine in the eyes of its followers 
—the getting rid of attractions which were represented as a revival 
of the aristotelian “occult qualities “substantial forms’ or 
wliatever else was the most disparaging way of describing the bad 
philosophy of the dark ages — and the providing some material 
intermedium by means of which a body may affect another at a 
distance and thus avoid the reproach urged against the newton 
ians that they made a body act where it wasnot and we are the 
less called upon to deny that this last feature in the newtonian 
theory was a difficulty inasmuch as newton himself was never

unwilling to allow that gravityiglit be merely an effect produced 
by some ulterior cause 

with such admissions on the two sides it is plain that the new 
tonian and cartesian systems would coiiyide if the hypothesis of 
vortices could be modified in such a way as to produce the force 
of gravitation all attempts to do this however failed and 
even john bernoulli the most obstinate of the mathematical cham 
pions of the vortices was obliged to give them up in his prize 
essay for on the inclinationa of the planetary orbits he 
says art viii the gravitation of the plaiels towards the center 
of the sun and the weight of bodies towards the center of the earth 
has not for its cause either the attraction of m newton or the 
centrifugal force of the matter of the vortex according to m des 
cartes ” and lie then goes on to assert that these forces are pro 
duced by a perpetual torrent of matter tending to the center on 
all sides and carrying all bodies with it such a hypothesis is very 
difficult to refute it has been taken up in more modern times by 
lo sage with some modifications and may be made to account 
fur the principal facts uf the universal gravitation of matter the 
great difficulty in the way of such a hypothesis is the overwhelming 
thought of the whole universe filled with torrents of an invisible but 
material and tangible substance rushing in every direction in infi 
nitely prolonged straight lines and with immense velocity whence 
can such matter como and whither can it go where can be its 
perpetual and infinitely distant fountain and where the ocean into 
which it pours itself wlien its infinite course is ended a revolv

central torrent of bernoulli the infinite streams of particles of

or a uoiirbilloii when tlie system was applied thus in the case 
of the last act of homage to the cartesian theory which the french 
academy rendered in the distribution of its prizes the designa 
tion of a cartesian ksy in along with three newtonian 
ones as worthy of a prize for an explanation of the tides the 
difference of high and low water was not explained as descartes 
has explained it by the pressure on the ocean of the terrestrial 
vortex forced into a strait where it passes under the moon but 
the waters were supposed to risetowards the imoon the terrestrial 
vortex being disturbed and broken by the moon and therefore less 
effective in forcing them down and in giving an account of a 
tourmaline from ceylon acad sc when it has been ascer 
tained that it attracts and repels substances tho writer adds ns 
a matter of course “it would seem that it has a vortex” as 
another example the elasticity of a body was ascribed to vortices 
between its particles and in general us i have said a vortex 
implied what we now imply by speaking of a central force 

 in the same manner vortices were ascribed to the magnet 
in order to account for its attractions and repulsions but we may 
note a circumstance udiieh gave a special turn to the hypothesis 
of vortices us applied to this subject and which may serve os a 
further illustration of the manner in which a transition may be 
made from one to the other of two rival hypotheses 

if iron tilings be brought near a magnet in such a manner 
as to be at liberty to assume the position which its polar action 
asigis to them for instance by strewing them upon a sheet of 
pater while the two poles of the magnet are clise below the paper 
they will arrange themselves in certain curves each proceeding 
from the n to the s pole of the magnet like the meridians in 
a map of the globe it is easily shown on the supposition of 
magnetic attraction and repulsion that these magnetic curves as 
they are ermed are each a curve whoso tangent at every point is 
the dircctionf a small lino of particle as determined by the 
attraction and repulsion of the two poles but if we suppose a 
magnetic vortex constantly to flow out ofi one polo and into the 
other in streams which follow such cflrves it is cviment that such a 
vortex being supposed to exercise material pressure and impulse 
would arrange the iron filings in corresponding streams nd would 
thus produce the phenomenon which have described and the 
hjrpothesis of central torrents of bernoulli or le sage which have 
referred to would in its application to magnets really become this 
hypothesis of a magnetic vortex if we farther suppose that the 
matter of the torrents which proceed to one pole and from the 



transformation of hypotheses c i 

 

other mingles its streams so as at each point to produce a stream 
in the resulting direction of course we shall have to suppose two 
sets of magnetic torrents a boreal toicnt proceeding to the 
north pole and from the south pole of a magnet and an austral 
torrent proceeding to the south and from the north pole— and 
with these suppositions we make a transition from the hypothesis 
of attraction and repulsion to the cartesian hypothesis of vortices 
or at least torrents which determine bodies to their magnetic 
positions by impulse 

of course it is to be expected that in this as in the other case 
whcn wo follow the hypothesis of impulse into detail it will need to 
be loaded with so many subsidiary hypotheses in order to accom 
modate it o the phenomena that it will no lunger seem tenable 
but the plausibility of the hypothesis in its first application cannot 
be denied — for it may be observed the two opposite streams 
would counteract each other so as to produce no local motion 
only direction and this case may put us on our guard against 
other suggestions of forces acting in curve lines which may at 
first sight appear to bo discerned in magnetic and electric phe 
nomena probably such curve lines will all be found to bo only 
resulting lines arising from the direct action and combination of 
elementary attraction and repulsion 

 there is another case in which it would not bo difficult 
to devise a mode of transition from one to the other of two rival 
theories namely in the case of the emission theory and the un 
dulation theory of lylit indeed several steps of such a transi 
tion have already appeared in the history of optical speculation 
and the conclusive objection to the emission theory of light as 
to the cartesian theory of vortices is that no amount of additional 
hypotheses will reconcile it to the phenomena its defenders hada 
to go on adding one piece of machinery after another as new 
classes of facts came into view tjll it became more complex and 
unmochanical than the theory of epicycles and eccentrics at its 
worst period otherwise as have said there was nothing to 
prevent the emission tlilory from migrating into the undulatorjr 
theory and aa the theory of vorticea did into the theory of attrac 
tion for the emissionists allow that rays may interfere and 
that these interferences may be modified by alternate fits in the 
rays now these fits are already a kind of undulation then again 
the phenomena of polarized light show that the fits or undulations 
must have a transverse character and there is no reason why emit 
ted rays should not be snbject to fits of transverse modification as 
well as to any other fits in short we may add to the emitted rays

of the one theory all the properties which belong to the nndula 
tions of the other and thus account for all the phenomena on tho 
emission theory with tjjlia limitation only that the emission will 
hare no share in the explanation and the undulations will have 
the whole if instead of conceiving the universe full of a sta 
horuiry ether we suppose it to be full of etherial particles moving 
in every direction and if wo suppose in the one cose and in the 
other this ether to be susceptible of undulations proceeding from 
every luminous point the results of tho two hypotheses will be the 
same and all we shall have to say is that the supposition of the 
emissive motion of the particles is superfluous and useless 

 this view of the manner in which rival theories pass into one 
another appears to be so unfamiliar to those who have only slightly 
attended to the history of pience that i havo thought it might bo 
worth while to illustrate it by a few examples 

it might be said for instance by such persons either the 
planets are not moved by vortices or they do not move by the law 
by which heavy bodies fall it is impossible that both opinions can 
be true” but it appears by what has been said above that tho 
cartesians did hold both odnions to be true and one with just ns 
much reason as the other on their assumptions it might be said 
in the same manner either it is false that the planets are made to 
describe their orbits by the above quasicartesian theory of ber 
noulli or it is false that they obey the newtonian theory of gravi 
tation but this would be said quite erroneously for if the hypo 
thesis of bernottlli be true it is so because agrees in its result 
with the theory of newton it is not only possible that both 
opinions may be true but it is certain that if the first bo so tho 
second is it might be said again either the planets dcscibo 
stheir orbits by an inherent virtue or according to the newton 
theory but this again would be erroneous for tho newtonian 
doctrine decided nothing as towhether the force of gravitation 
was inherent or not cotes held that it was though newton 
strongly protested against being supposed to hold such an opinion 
the word inherent is no part of the physical theory and will bo 
asserted or denied according to our metaphysical views of the 
essential attributes of matter and force 

of course the possibility of two rival hypotheses being tnie 
one of which takes the explanation a step higher than the otiier 
is not affected by the impossibility of two contradictory asser

tions of the same order of generalitj being both true if thero 
be a new discovered comet and if one astronomer asserts that 
it vrill return once in every twenty years and another that it 
will return once in every thirty years both cannot be right 
but if an astronomer says that though its interval was in the last 
instance years it will only be years to the next return in 
comseqnenoe of perturbation and resistance he may be perfectly 
right 

and thus when different and rival explanations of the same 
phenomena are held till one of them though long defended by 
ingenious men is at last driven out of the field by the pressure of 
facts the defeated hypothesis is transformed before it is extin 
guished before it has disappeared it has been modified so as to 
have all palpable falsities squeezed out of it and subsidiary provi 
siona added in order to reconcile it wiln the phenomena it has 
in short been penetrated infiltrated and metamorphosed by the 
surrounding medium of truth before the merely arbitrary and erro

on hegel’s criticism of newton’s 

principia 

• 

am phil soc may 


newtonian doctrine isf nnitersal gravitation as the cause of 
the motions which take place in the solar system is so entirely 
established in our minds and the fallacy of all the ordinary argu 
‘nients against it is so clearly understood among us that it would 
undoubtedly be deemed a waste of time to argue such questions in 
this place so far as physical truth is concerned but since in other 
parts of europe there are teachers of philosophy whose reputation 
and influence ore very great and who are sometimes referred to 
among our own countrymen as the authors of new and valuable 
views of truth and who yet reject the newtonian opinions and deny 
the validity of the proofs common j given of them it may be worth 
while to attend for a few minutes to the declarations of such 
teachers as a feature in the present conditionof european philo 
sophy i the more readily assume that the cambridge philosophical 
society will not think a communication on such a subject devoid of 
interest in consequence of the favourable reception which it has 
ven to philosophical speculations still more abstract which have 
on previous occasions offered to it will therefore proceed to 
make some repsarks on the opinfons concerning the newtonian 
doctrine of gravitation delivered by the celebrated hegel of berlin 
than whom no philosopher in modern and pkrhaps hardly any even 
in ancient times has had his teaching received with more reverential 
submission by his disciples or been followed by a more numerous 
and zealous band of scholars bent upon difpusing and applying his 
principles 

the passages to which i shall principally refer are taken from one 
of his works which is called f ac encyclopbdia encyklopudie of 
which the first part is the science of logic the second the philosophy 
of nature the third the philosophy of spirit the second part 



criticism of kewton’s principia 

¦with which i am here concerned has for an alitfr title lectures on 
natural philosophy vorlesungen iiber naturphilosophie and 
would through its whole extent oifer abundant material for criticism 
by referring it to principles with which waro here familiar but i 
shall for the present confine myself to that part which refers to the 
subject which have mentioned the newtonian doctrine of gravi 
tation § of the work nor shall i with regard to this 
part think it necessary to give a continuous and complete criticism 
of all the passages bearing upon the subject bu only such speci 
mens and such remarks thereon as may suffice to show in a general 
manner the value and the character of hegel’s declarations on such 
questions i do not pretend to offer here any opinion upon the 
value and character of llegol’a philosophy in general but think 
it not unlikely that some impression on that head may be suggested 
by the examination here offered of soac points in which we can 
have no doubt whore the truth lies and i am not at all persuaded 
tiiut a like examination of many other parts of the hegelian 
nncyclopredia would not confirm the impression which we shall 
receive from the parts now to be considered 

itegel both criticises the newtonian doctrines or what he states 
as such and also not denying the truth of the laws of phenomena 
which he refers to for instance kepler’s laws offers his own proof 
of these laws shall make a few brief remarks on each of these 
portions of the pages before me and i would beg it to be under 
stood that where i may happen to put my remarks in a short and 
what may seem a peremptory form du so for the sake of saving 
time knowing that among us upon subjects so familiar a few 
words will sutlico for the same reason shall take passages from 
hegel not in the order in which they occur but in the order in 
which they best illustrate what i have to say i shall do hegel no 
injustice by this mode of proceeding for i will annex a faithfd 
translation so far as i can make one of the whole of tho passages 
referred to with the context 

no one will bo surprised that a german or indeed any lover of 
science should speak vlith admiration of the discovery of kepler’s 
laws as a great event in the history of astronomy and a glorious 
distinction to the discoverer but to say that the glory of the dis 
covery of the proof of these laws has been unjustly transferred from 
kepler to newton is quite another matter this is ¦what hegel 
says a and we have to consider the reasons which he assigns 
for saying so 


 these letters refer to passages in tlie translation annexed to this memoiiw 



appendix h 


 

he says ft that it is allowed by mathematicians that the now 
tonian formula maybe derired from the keplerian laws’ and hence 
he seems to infer that the newtonian law is not an additional truth 
that is he does not alw that the discoreiy of the cause which 
produces a certain phenomenal law is anything additional to the 
discovery of the law itself 

the newtonian formula may be derived from the keplerian 
law” it was professedly so derived but derived by introducing 
the idea of force which idea an its consequences were not intro 
duced and developed till after keplers time 

the newtonian formula may be derived from the keplerian 
law and the keplerian law may be derived and was derived 
from the observations of the greek astronomers and their suc 
cessors but was not the less a new and great discovery on that 
account 

but let us see what he says farther of this derivation of the new 
tonian formula from the keplerian law it is evident that by 
calling it a formula he means to imply what he also asserts that it 
is no new law but only a new form and a bad one of a previously 
known truth 

how is the newtonian ‘formula” that is the law of the inverse 
squares of the central force derived from the keplerian law of the 
cubes of the distances proportional to the squares of the times 
this says hegel is the immediate derivation’ cby kepler 

a® 

law a being the distance and t the periodic time is constant 

but newton calls — universal gravitation whence it easily follows 
that gravitation is inversely as 

this is hegel’s way of representing newton’s proof reading 
ft any one who had never read the principia might suppose that 
c a 

newton definyf gravitation to bo we who have read the 

principia know that newton proves that in circles the central 

force not the universal gravitation is as that he proves this 

by setting out from the idea of force as that which deflects a body 
from the tangent and makes it describe a curved line and that in 
this way he passes from kepler’s laws of mere motion to his own 
law of force 

but hegel does not see any value in this such a mode of 
treating the subject he says f “offers tons a tangled web formed 
ef the lines of the mere geometrical construction to which a 



criticism of newton’s puincipia 

physical meaning of independent forces is given’ that a mjrosuve 
of forces is found in such lines as the sngitta of the arc described in 
a given time not such a meaning arbitrarily given to them is 
certainly true and is very distinctly provediin newton and in all our 
elementary books 

but says hegel as further showing the artificial nature of the 
newtonian formulae h analysis has long been able to derive tlc 
newtonian expression and the laws therewith connected out of the 
form of the keplerian laws” an assertion to verify which ho 
refers to francccur’s mecanique this is apparently in order to show 
that the “ lines of the newtonian construction are buperhuon 
we know very well that analysis dues not always refer to visiblo 
representations of such lines but we know too and franca nr 
would testify to this also that the analytical proofs contain cqiii 
valcnts to the newtonian lines we in this place are too familiar 
with the substitution of analytical for geometrical proofs to be led 
to suppose that such a substitution affects the substance of the 
truth proved the conversion of newton’s geometrical proofs of 
his discoveries into analytical processes by succeeding writers has 
not made them cease to be discoveries and accordingly those 
who have taken the most prominent share in such a conversion 
have been the most ardent admirers of newton’s genius and good 
fortune 

so much for newtons comiarison of the forces in different cir 
cular orbits and for hegel’s power of understanding and criticising 
it now lot us look at the motion in different parts of the same 
elliptical orbit as further illustration of the value of hegels 
criticism in an elliptical orbit the velocity alternately increases 
and diminishes this follows necessarily from kepler’s law of the 
equal description of the areas and so newton explains it hegel 
however treats of this acceleration and rcturdatioi as a separate 
fact and talks of another explanation of it founded uppn centri 
petal and centrifugal force o where he finds tlis explanation 
 know not certainly not in newton who in the second and third 
section of the principia explains the variation of the velocity in a 
quite different manner as f have said and nowhere i think em 
ploys centrifugal force in his explanations however the notion 
of centrifugal as acting along with centripetal force is introduced 
in some treatises and may undoubtedly be used with perfect truth 
and propriety how far hegel can judge when it is so used we 
may see from what he says of the confusion produced by such an 
explanation which is he says a maximum in the first place he 
speaks of the motion being uniformly accelerated and retarded in 



appendix n 


 

an elliptical orbit hicli in any exact use of the word uniformly 
it is not but passing by this he proceeds to criticise an explana 
tion not of the variable velocity of the body in its orbit but of the 
alternate access and reeoss of the body to and from the center 
let us overlook this confusion also and see what is the value of his 
criticism on the explanation he says p according to this ex 
planation in the motion of a planet from the aphelion to the peri 
lielion the centrifugal is less than the centripetal force and in the 
perihelion itself the centripetal force is supposed suddenly to 
become greater than the centrifugal ’ and so of course tho body 
reascends to the aphelion 

now will not say that this explanation has never been given in 
ii book professing to be scientific but have never seen it given 
and it never can liave been given but by a very ignorant and foolish 
person it goes upon the utterly unmechanicjil iiiposition that 
tho approach of abody to the center at any moment depends solely 
upon the excess of the centripetal over the centrifugal force and 
reversely but the most elementary knowledge of mechanics shows 
us that when a body is moving obliquely to the distance from the 
center it approaches to or recedes from the center in virtue of this 
obliquity even if no force at all act and the total approach to 
the center is the approach due to this cause plus the approach due 
to the centripetal force minus the recess due to the centrifugal force 
at the aphelion the centripetal is greater than the centiifugal 
force and hence the motion becomes oblique and then the body 
approaches to the center on both accounts and approaches on 
account of the obliquity of the path even wheithe centrifugal has 
become greater than the centripetal force which it becomes before 
the body reaches the perihelion this reasoning is so elementary 
that when a person who cannot see this writes on the subject with 
ail air of authority do not see what can be done but to point out 
the oversight and leave it 

but there ibfays hegel q anther way of explaining the mo 
tion by means of centripetal and centrifugal forces the two forces 
are supposed to increase and decrease gradually according to dif 
ferent laws in this case there must be i point where they are equal 
and in equilibrio and this being the case they will always continue 
equal for there will be no reason for their going out of equilibrium 

this which is put as emother mode of explanation is in fact the 
same mode for as have already said the centrifugal force which 
is less than the centripetal at the aphelion becomes the greater of 
the two before the perihelion and there is an intermediate position 
at which the two forces are equal but at this point is there no 



criticism op newton’s principia 

reason why being equal the forces should become unequal reason 
abundant for the body being there moves in a line oblique to the 
distance and so changes its distance and the centripetal and cen 
trifugal force depending upon the distance by difterent laws they 
forthwith become unequal 

blit these modes of explanation by means of the centripetal and 
centrifugal forces and their relation are not necessary to newtons 
doctrine and are nowhere used by newton and undoubtedly much 
confusion has been produced in other minds a‘i well as ijegers by 
speaking of the centrifugal force which is a mere intrinsic geome 
trical result of a body’s curvilinear motion round a center in con 
junction with centripetal force which is an extrinsic force acting 
upon the body and urging it to the center neither newton nor 
any intelligent newtonian ever spoke of the centripetal and cen 
trifugal force as two distinct forces both extrinsic to the motion 
which hegel accuses them of doing n 

i have spoken of the third and second of kepler’s laws of new 
ton’s exjjlanations of them and of ijegcl’s criticism let us now 
in the samo manner consider the first law that the planets move 
in ellipses newton’s proof that this was the result of a central 
force varying inversely as the square of the distance was the solu 
tion of a problem at wdiich his contemporaries had laboured in vain 
and is commonly looked upon os an iiiiortant step “but” says 
hegel d “ the proof gives a conic section generally whereas the 
main point which ought to be proved is that the path of the body 
is an ellipse only not a circle or any other conic section cer 
tainly if new’ton aad proved that a planet cannot move in a circle 
which hegel says he ouglit to have done his system would have 
perplexed astronomers since there are planets which move in orbits 
hardly distinguishable from circles and the variation of the extre 
mity from planet to planet shows that there is nothing to preveiiis 
the excentricity vanishing and the orbit becoming a circle 

“but” says hegel again c the conditions wlpch make the 
path to be an ellipse rather than any other conic section are empi 
rical and extraneous tue supposed casual strength of the im 
pulsion originally received” certainly the circumstances which 
determine the amount of excentricity of a planets orbit are de 
rived from experience or rather observation it is not a part of 
newtons system to determine d priori what the excentricity of a 
planets orbit must be a system that professes to do this will 
undoubtedly be one very different from his and as our knowledge 
of the excentricity is derived from observation it is in that sense 
empirical and casual the strength of the original impulsion is a 



 appendix h 

hypothetical and impartial way of expressing this result of observa 
tion and as we see no reason why the excentricity should be of 
any certain magnitude we see none why the fraction which ex 
presses the excentricityshould not become as large as unity that 
is why the orbit should not become a parabola and accordingly 
some of the bodies which revolve about the same appear to move 
in orbits of this form so little is the motion in an ellipse as hegel 
says the only thing to be proved” 

but hegel himself has offered roof of keplers laws to which 
considering his objections to newtons proofs we cannot help 
turning with some curiosity 

and drat let us look at the proof of the proposition which we 
have been considering that the path of a planet is necessarily an 
ellipse i will translate hegel’s language as well as i can but 
without answering for the correctness of my translation since it 
does not appear to me to conform to the first condition of transla 
tion of being intelligible the translation however such as it 
is may help us to form some opinion of the validity and value of 
hegel’s proofs as compared with newtons r 

 for absolutely uniform motion the circle is the only path 
the circle is the line returning into itself in which all the radii 
arc equal there is for it only dne determining quantity the 
radius 

 but in free motion the determination according to space and 
to time come into view with differences there must be a dif 
ference in the spatial aspect in itself and therefore the form re 
quires two determining quantities hence luie form of the path 
returning into itself is an ellipse” 

now even if we could regard this as reasoning the conclusion 
does not in the smallest degree follow a curve returning into 
itself and determined by two quantities may have innumerable 
forms beoides the ellipse for instance any oval form whatever 
besides that of the conic section 

but why must the curve be a curve returning into itself hegel 
has professed to prove this previously m fipom the determination 
of particularity and individuality of bodies in general so that 
they have partly a center in themselves and partly at the same 
time their center in another without seeking to find any precise 
meaning in this we may ask whether it proves the impossibility of 
the orbits with moveable apses which do not return into them 
selves such as the planets affected by perturbations really do 
describe and such as we know that bodies must describe in all 
cases except when the force varies exactly as the square of the 



criticism newton’s principia i 

distance it appears to do so and it proves this impossibility of 
known facts at least as much as it proves anything 

let us now look at hegers proof of kepler’s second law that 
the elliptical sectors swept by the radius yctor are proportional to 
the time it is this 

 in the circle the aic or angle which is included by the two 
radii is independent of them but in the motion of a planet as 
datcrriiined by the conception the distance from the center and the 
ore run over in a certain time usl be compounded in one deter 
mination and must make out a whole this whole is the sector 
a space of two dimensions and hence the arc is essentially a 
function of the radius vector and the former the arc being 
unequal brinp with it the inequality of the radii” 

as was said in the former case if we could regard this as reason 
ing it would not prove the conclusion but only that the arc is 
some function or other of the radii 

hegel indeed oilers t reason why there must be an arc in 
volved this arises he says from tho dcterminatencss of the 
nature of motion at one while as time in the root at another 
while as space in the square but here the quadratic character of 
the space is by the returning of the line of motion into itself 
limited to a sector” 

probably my readers have had a sufficient specimen of hegels 
mode of dealing with these matters i will however add his proof 
of kepler’s third law that the cubes of tbe distances are as the 
squares of the times 

hegel’s proof in jhis case u has a reference to a previous doc 
trine concerning falling bodies in which time and space have he 
says a relation to each other as root and square falling bodies 
however are tbe case of only halffree motion and the determina 
tion is incomplete • ‘ 

but in the case of absolute motion the domain of free masses 
the determination attains us totidity the time tlie root is a 
mere empirical magnitude but as a component of the developed 
totality it is a totality in itself it produces itself and therein has 
a reference to itself and i this process time being itself the 
dimensionless element only conies to a formal identity with itself 
and reaches the square space on the other hand as a positive 
external relation oomes to the full dimensions of the conception of 
space that is the cube the realization of the two conceptions 
space and time preserves their original difference this is the 
third keplerian law tlie relation of the cubes of the distances to 
the squares of the times’ 



 


appendix h 


and this he adds v tvith remarkable complacencj repre 
sents simply and immediately the reason of the thing — awhile on 
the contrary the newtonian formula by means of which the law 
is changed into a law the force of gravity shows the distortion 
and inversion of beflexion which stops halfway” 

i am not able to assign any precise meaning to the bejlewion 
which is here used as a term of condemnation applicable especially 
to the newtonian doctrine it is repeatedly applied in the same 
manner by hegel thus he aygp that what kepler expresses 
in a simple and sublime manner in the form of laws of the celes 
tial motions newton has metamorphosed into the rtfiexionform 
of the force of gravitation” 

though hegel thus denies newton all merit with regard to tlio 
explanation of kepler’s laws by means of the gravitation of the 
planets to the sun he allows that to the keplerian jaws newton 
added the principle of perturbations zc this principle he accepts 
to a certain extent transforming the expression of it after his 
peculiar fashion “it lies” ho says j “in this that matter in 
general assigns a center for itself the collective bodies of the sys 
tem recognise a reference to their sun and all the individual bodies 
according to the relative positions into which they are brought by 
their motions form a momentary relation of their gravity towards 
each other” 

this must appear to us a very loose and insiifhcicnt way of 
stating the principle of perturbations but loose as it is it recognises 
that the perturbations depend upon the gravity of the planets one 
to anotlicr unj to the sun and if the pertuations depend upon 
those forces one can hardly suppose that any one who allows this 
will deny that the primary undisturbed motions depend upon these 
forces and must be explained by means of them yet this is what 
jlegel denies 

it is evident on looking at hegel’s mode of reasoning on such 
subjects that his views approach towards those of aristotle and the 
aristotelians accordiug to which motions were divided into na 
tural and unnatural — the celestial mot jpns were circular and uni 
form in their nature — and the likej perlaps it may be worth 
whde to show how completely hegel adheres to these ancient 
views by an extract from the additions to the articles on celes 
tial motions made in the last edition of the bnoycjopcedia he 
says w 

“ the motion of the heavenly bodies is not a being pulled this 
way and that as is imagined by the newtonians they go ajbng 
oi the ancients said like blessed gods the celestial conformity is 



criticism or newton’s principu i 

not inch a one as has the principle of rest or motion external to 
itself xt is not right to aaj because a stone is inert and the whole 
earth consists of stones and the other heayenly bodies are of the 
same nature as the earth therefore the hrenly bodies are inert 
this conclusion makes the properties of the whole the same as 
those of the part itnpnlse pressure resistance friction pulling 
and the like are yalid only for other than celestial matter’ 

there can be no doubt that this is a very different doctrine from 
that of newton • 

 will only add to these specimens of hegel’s physics a specimen 
of the logic by which he refutes the newtonian argument which 
has just been adduced namely that the celestial bodies are matter 
and that matter as we see in terrestriid matter is inert he 
says xy 

doubtless both are matter as a good thought and a bed thought 
are both thoughts but the bad one is not therefore good because 
it is a thought”

this subject i refer to the elegant exposition in frane€burs

method of socalled proof is conspicuous as offering to us a 
tangled web formed of the lines of the mere geometrical 
construction to which a physical meaning of independent 
forces is given and of empty jleflexion determinations of 
the already mentioned accelerating force and vis inertiee 
and especially of the relation of the socalled gravitation itself 
to the centripetal force and centrifuged force and so on 

the remarks wmch are here made would undoubtedly have 
need of a further explication to show how well founded they 
are in a compendium propositions of this kind which do not 
agree with that which is assumed can only have the slape of 
assertions indeed since they contradict such high authori 
ties they roust appear as something worse as presumptuous 
assertions will not on this subject support myself by say 
hy the bye that an interest in these subjects has occupied 
me for years but it is more precisely to the purpose to 
remark that the distinctions and determinations which ma 
thematical analysis introduces and thecourse which it must 
take according to its method is altogether different from that 
which a physical reality must have the presuppositions the 
gonrse ahd the bosultb which the analysis necessarily has 
and gives remain quite extraneous to the considerations which 
detinniue the physioil value and the slgniffcation of those de

much which belonged to newtons essential principles and 
glory — has added to the keplerian laws is the principle of

perturbahoru — a principle whose importance we may here 
accept thus for hier in sofern anzufuhren ist namelyi so 
k far as it rests upon tlie proposition that the socalled attrac 
tion is an operation of all the indiviiaal parts of bodies as 
 being material it lies in thi that matter in general assigns 
a center for itself aich das centrum setzt and the figure of 
the body is an element in the determination of its place that 
collective bodies of the system recognize a reference to their 
sun sich ihre sonne setzen bat also the individual bodies 
themselves according to the relative position with regard to 
each other into which they come by their general motion 
form a momentary relation of their gravity schwere towards 
each other and are related to each other not only in abstract 
spatial relations but at the same time ossigu to themselves a 
joint center which howevw is agmn resolved into the general 
center in the universal system 

as to what concerns the features of the path to show how 
the fundamental determinations of free motion are connected 
with the conception cannot here be undertriten in a satisfac 
tory and detailed manner and must therefore be left to its fate 
the proof from reason of the quantitative determinations of 
free motion can only rest upon the determinations of conoqt 
hons of space and time the elements whose relation intrinsic 
not extrinsic motion is 

m that in the first place the motion in general if a motion 
returfang into itulf is founded on the determination of parti 
cularity and inaviduality of the bodies in general § so that 
partly they have a center in themselves and partly at the same 
time their center in another these are the determinations of 
conceptions which form the basis of the false representatives 
a of centripetal force and centrifugal force as if each of 
these were selfexistiog extraneous to the other jmd inde

decrease and increase of the magnitade of the centripetal 
force and centrifugal force the confiuim which the asintnp 
tion of such independent forces produces is at its greatest 

p height according to this explanation in the motion of a 
planet from the aphelion to the perihelion the centrifugal 
is ess than the centripetal force and on the contrary in the 
perihelion itself the centrifugal force is supposed to become 
greater than the centripetal for the motion arom the peri 
helion to the aphelion thia representation makes the forces 
pass into the opposite relation in the same manner it is ap 
parent that such a sudden conversion of the preponderance 
which a force has obtained over another into an inferiority to 
the other cannot be anything taken out of the nature of 
forces on the contrary it must be concluded that a pre 
ponderance which one force has obtained over another must 
not only be preserved but must go onwards to the complete 
annihilation of the other force and the motion must either 
by the preponderance of the centripetal force proceed till it 
ends in rest that is in the collision of the planet with the 
central body or till by the preponderance of the centriaigal 

q force it ends in a straight hue but now if in place of the 
suddenness of the conveslon we suppose a gradual increase 
of the force in question then since rather the other force 
ought to be assumed as increasing we lose the opposition 
which is assumed for the sake of the explanation and if the 
increase of the one is assumed to be different from that of the 
other which is the case in some represettatione then there 
is found at th mean distance between the apsides a point in 
which the forces are in equilibrio and the transition of the 
forces out of equilibrium is a thing just as little without any 
sufllcient reason as the aforesaid suddenness of inversion 
and in the whole of thia kind of explanation we see that the 
modb of remedying a bod moe of dealing with a subject leads 
to newersnd greater confosiona similar confnsion makes 
its appearance in the explanation of the phsenomenon that 
the pendulum oscillate more swwlyat the equator this 
phsnomenon is ascribed to the centrifhgiil forces which it is 
asserted most then be greater but it is easy to see that we 
niayjnst as well ascribe it to the augmented grarity inasmuch 
as that holds the pendulum mote strongly to the perpondi

r and now first as to what concerns the form of the path 

the circie only can be ooncelted as the path of an absolutely 
uniform motion conceivable as people express it no doubt 
it is that an increasing and diminishing motion should take 
place in a circle but this oonoeirablenessor possibility means 
only an abstract capability of being repisented which leaves 
out of sight that determinate thing on which the question 
turns • 

the circle is he line returning into itself in which all the 
radii are equal that is it is completely determined by means of 
the adius there is only one determination and that is the 
whole determination 

but in free motion in which the fteterminations according 
to space and according to time come into vfew with differ 
ences in a qualitative relation to each other this relation 
appears in the spatial aspect as a difference thereof in itself 
which therefore requires two detennioatiohs hereby tho 
form of the path returning into itsdlf js euentially an 
ellipse 

s the abstract determinateness which produces the circle 
appears also in this way that the arc or angle which is in 
cluded by two radii is independent of them a magnitude with 
regard to them completely empirical but since in the motion 
as determined by the conception the distance from the 
center and the arc which is run orer in a certain time must 
be comprelientled in one determinateness aruf make out a 
whole this is the sectmr a spacedetermination of two dimen 
sions in this way the arc is essentially a function of the 
radius vector and the former the arc being unequal brings 
with it the inequality of the radii that the determination 
with regard to the space by means of the time appears as a 
determination of two dlmchsions— m a supeaciesdetermi

falling bodies fith regard to the exposition of the same

discnssion of the nature of the grounds and proofs of tbe 
 most general propositions which the physical sciences include 
belongs rather to metaphysics than to that course of experimental 
and mathematical investigation by which the sciences ore formed 
but such discussions seem by no means unfitted to occupy the at 
tention of the cultivators of ph slept science the ideal as well as 
the experimental side of our knowledge must be carefully studied 
and scrutinized i in order that its true import may be seen and 
this province of hunisn speculation has been perhaps of late un 
justly depreciated and neglected by men of science yet it can be 
prosecuted in the most advantageous manner by them only for no 
one can speculate securely and rightly respecllng the nature and 
proofs of the truths of science without a steady possession of some 
large and soud portions of such truths a man must be a mathe 
matician a mechanical philosopher a natural historian in order 
tvat he may philosophize well concerning mathematics and me 
chanics apd natural history and the mere metaphysician who 
without such preparation and fitftess sets himself to determine 
the grounds of mathematical or hieohanloal truths or the prin 
ciples of olassificatiod will be liable to be igd into error at every 
step he must speculate by means of general terms which be will 
not be able to nse as instruments of discovering and eonveying 
philosophical tnitfa because be oanno in his own mind habitually 
and familiarly embody their import in special examples 

acting upon auch views i have already laid before the fhilosor 
phioal society of cambridge essays on such subjects as here refer 
to especially a memoir on the natnre of the tmtb of tbe xaws 
of motion’ which was printed by rite society in its tmsactions 



all matter is heavy 

this inemoir appears to hare excited in other places notice of such 
a kind as to show that the minds of many speculative persons are 
ready for and inclined toivards the discussion of such questions 
i am therefore the more willing to brig under consideration 
anotlier subject of a kind closely related to the one just men 
tioned 

the general questions which all such discussions suggest are 
in the existing phase of english philosophy whether certain pro 
posed scientific truths as the lavis of motion be mcesary truths 
and if they are necessary which have atteutpted to show that in 
a certain sense they are on what ground their necessity rests 
these questions may be discussed in a general form as have 
elsewhere attempted to show but it may be instructive also to 
follow the general arguments into the form which they assume in 
special cases and to exhibit in a distinct shape the incongruities 
into which the opposite false doctrine leads us when applied to parti 
cular examples this accordingly is what i propose to do in the 
present memoir with regard to the proposition stated at the head 
of this paper namely that all matter is heavy 

at first sight it may appear a doctrine altogether untenable to 
assert that thi proposition is a necessary truth for it may be 
urged we have no difficulty in conceiving matter which is not 
heavy so that matter without weight is a conception not incon 
sistent with itself which it must be if the reverse were a necessary 
truth it may be added that the possibility of conceiving matter 
without weight was shown in the controversy which ended in the 
downfall of the phaogiston theory of chemical composition for 
some of the reasoners on this subject asserted phlogiston to be a 
body with positive levity instead of gravity which hypothesis how 
ever false shows that such a supposition is possible again it 
may be said that weight and inertia are two separate propertie 
of matter that mathematicians measure the quantity oj matter 
by the inertia and that we leim by experimenionly that the 
weight is proportional to the inertia newtons experiments with 
pendulums of differenlmaterials having been made with this very 
object 

 proceed to reply to these arguments and first as to the 
possibility of conceiving matter without weight and the argument 
thence deduced that the universal gravity of matter is not a neces 
sary truth i remark that it is indeed just to say that vre cannot 
even distinctljr conceive the contrary of a necessary truth to be 
true but that this impossibility can be asserted only of those pri 
fectly distinct conceptions which result from a complete develop

ment of the fundamental idea and ito consequeneeb till we reach 
this stage of development the obscurity and indistinctnesb may 
prevent our perceiving absolnte contradictions though they exist 
we have abundant stoxa of examples of this even in geometry and 
arithmetic where the truths are nniversally allowed to be neces 
sary and where the relations which are impossible aralso incon 
ceivable that is not conceivable distinctly snch relations though 
not distinctly conceivable still often appear conceivable and pos 
sible owing to the indistinctness of onr ideas who at the first 
outset of his geometrical studies sees any impossibility in suppos 
ing the side and the diagonal of a square to have a common mea 
sure yet they can be rigorously proved to be incommensurable 
uid therefore the attempt distinctly to conceive a common measnre 
of them must fail the attempts at the geometrical duplication of 
the cube and the supposed solutions as that of hobbes have 
involved absolute contradictions yet this has not prevented their 
being long and obstinately entertained by men even of minds acute 
and clear in other respects and the same might be shewn to 
be the cose in arithmetic it is plain therefore that we cannot 
from the supposed possibility of conceiving matter without weight 
infer that the contrary may not be a necessary truth 

our power of judging from the compatibility or incompatibility 
of onr conception whether certain propositions respecting the 
relations of ideas are true or not must depend entirely as have 
said upon the degree of development which such ideas have under 
gone in onr minds some of the relations of our conceptions on 
any subject are evident upon the first steady contemplation of the 
fhndamental idea by a sonud mind these are the axioms of the 
subject other propositions may be deduced from the axioms by 
strict logical reasoning these propositions are no less necessary 
than the axioms though to common minds their evidence is very 
diiferentt yet as we become ikmiliar with the steps by which these 
ulterior truthfsare deduced froof the axioms their truth also be 
comes evident and the contrary becomes inconceivable when a 
person has familiarised htmsf with the fimt twenfysix proposi 
tions of euclid and not till then it becomes evident to him that 
parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallels 
ore eqoal and he cannot even conceive the contrary when he 
has a little fhrther cultivated his geometrical powers the equality 
of the square on the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle to the 
squares on the sides becomes also evident the steps by which la 
demonstratedr being so familiar to the mind as to be apprehended 
without a conscious aet and thus the contrary of a necessary 



all mattee is heavy 

troth cannot be distlnctlj conceived bnt the incapacity of forming 
such a conception is a condition which depends upon cultivation 
being intimately connected with the power of rapidly and clearly 
perceiving the connection of the necessary imth under consideration 
with the elementary principles on which it depends and thus 
again it may be that there is an absolute impossibility of conceiving 
matter without weight but then this impossibility may not bo 
apparent till we have traced our fundamental conceptions of matter 
into some of their consequences 

the question then occurs whether we can by auy steps of rea 
soning point out an inconsistency in the conception of matter 
without weight this i conceive we may do and this shall 
attempt to show 

the general mode of stating the argument is thithe quantity 
of matter is measured by those sensible properties of matter which 
undergo quantitative addition subtraction and division as the mat 
ter is added subtracted and divided the quantity of matter can 
not be known in any other way but this mode of measuring the 
quantity of matter in order to be true at all must be universally 
true if it were only partially true the limits within which it is 
to be applied would be arbitrary and therefore the whole proce 
dure would be arbitrary and as a method of obtaining philosophi 
cal truth altogether futile 

we may unfold this argument further let the contrary be sup 
posed of that which we assert to be true namely let it be sup 
posed that while all other kinds of matter are heavy and of course 
heavy in proportiou’to the quantity of matter there is one kind of 
matter which is absolutely destitute of weight as for instance 
phlogiston or any other element then where this tpeigktlets 
element as we may term it is miaed with weighty elements we 
shall have a compound in which the weight is no longer proper 
tional to the quantity of matter if for example qieaanres of 
heavy matter unite with one measure of phlogistqqi the weight is 
as and the quantity of matter os in all such cases therefore 
the weight ceases be the measure of the quantity of matter 
and as the proportion of ihe weighty and the weightless matter 
may vary in innumerable degree in such compounds the weight 
affords no criterion at all of the quantity of matter in them and 
the smallest admixture of the weightless element is sufficient to 
prevent the weight from being taken os the measure of the quan 
tity of matter 

but on this hypothesis how are we to distinguish such eom 
ponnds from bodies consisting purely of heavy matter how are 



appendix k 


 

we to satisfy ourselves that there is not in every body some admix 
ture small or great of the weightless element if we call this 
element phlogiston how shall we know that the bodies with whioh 
we have to do arc any of them absolutely free from phlogiston 

we cannot refer to the weight for any such assurance for by 
supposition the presence and absence of phlogiston makes no dif 
ference in the weight nor can any other properties seoure us at 
least from a very small admixture for to assert that a mixture of 
 in ioo or in of phlogiston would always manifest itself in 
the properties of the body must be au arbitrary procedure till we 
bave proved this assertion by experiment and we cannot do this 
till we have learnt some mdc of measuring the quantities of matter 
in bodies and parts of bodies which is exactly what we question 
the possibility of in the present hypothesis 

thus if we assume the existence of an element phlogiston 
devoid of weight we cannot be sure that every body does not con 
tain some portion of tliis element while we see that if there be an 
admixture of such an element the weight is no longer any criterion 
of the quantity of matter and thus wc bave proved that if there 
be any kind of matter which is not heavy the weight con no longer 
avail us in any case or to any extent as a measure of the quantity 
of matter 

 may remark tliat the same conclusion is easily extended to the 
case in which phlogiscon is supposed to have absolute levity for in 
that case a certain mixture of phlogiston and of heavy matter 
would have no weight and might be substituted for phlogiston in 
the preceding reasoning 

 may remark also that the same conclusion would follow by 
the same reasoning if any kind of matter instead of being void of 
weight were heavy indeed but not so heavy in proportion to its 
quantity of matter as other kinds 

on all these hypotheses there would be no possibility of measur 
ing quantity of matter by weight at ku in any ease or to any extent 

but it may be urged that we have not yet reduced the hypothe 
sis of matter without weight to a cootudictn for that mathe 
maticians measure quantity of matter not by weight but by the 
other property of which we have spoken inertia 

to this reply that proctioally speaking quantity of matter is 
always measured by weight both by mechanicians and chemists t 
and as we have proved that this procedure is utterly insecure in all 
cases on the hypothesis of weightless matter the practice rests 
upon a conviction that the hypothesis is false and yet the prao 
tice is universal every experimenter measures quantity of matter 



all matter is heavy 


 

by the biilance ko one has ever thought of measuring quantity of 
matter by its inertia practically no one has constructed a measure 
of quantity of matter in which the matter produces its indications 
of quantity by its motion when we havelbo take into account the 
inertia of a body we inquire what its weight is and assume this as 
the measure of the inertia but we never take tho contrary course 
and ascertain the inertia hrst in order to determine by that means 
the weight 

but it may be askedi is it tot then true and an important 
scientific truth that the guantliy of tuatier is measured by the 
inertia is it not true and proved by experiment that the might 
is proportional to the inertia t if this be not the result of newton’s 
experiments mentioned above shat it may be demanded do they 
prove 

to these questions x reply it is true that quantity oi matter is 
measured by the inertia for it is true that inertia is as the quantity 
of matter this truth is indeed one of the laws of motion that 
weight is proportional to inertia is proved by experiment as far as 
the laws of motion are so proved and newton’s experiments prove 
one of the laws of motion so far as any experiments can prove 
them or are needed to prove them 

that inertia is proportional to weight is a law equivalent to that 
law which asserts that when pressure produces motion in a given 
body tiie velocity produced in a given time is as tho pressure for 
if the velocity be as the pressure when the body is gien the 
velocity will be constant if the inertia also be as the pressure for 
the inertia is underlbood to be that property of bodies to which 
ceteris paribus the velocity impressed isinversdy proportional one 
body has twice os much inertia as another if when the same force 
nets upon it for the same time it acquires but half the velocity 
this is the fundamental conception of inertia 

in newton’s pendulum experiments the pressure prodycing mo 
tion was a certain resolved part ol the weight and wjis proportional 
to the weight it appeared by the experiments that whatever were 
the material of which he pendulum was formed the rate of osett 
latiou was the same that il the velocity acquired was the same 
hence the inertia of the different bodies must have been in each 
cose as the weight and thus this assertion is true of all different 
kinds of bodies 

thos it appears that the assertion that inertia is nniversally 
proportional to weight is equivalent to the law of motion that the 
velocity is as the pressure the conception of inertia of which 
ns we have said the ftindamental conception u that the veloolty 



appendix k 


 

impressed is inversely proportional to the inertia oonnpcts the 
two propoations so as to make them identical 

hence onr argument with regard to the universal gravity of 
matter brings us to thr above law of motion arid is proved by 
newton’s experiments in the same sense in which that law of mo 
tion is so proved 

perhaps some persons might conceive that the identity of weight 
and inertia is obvious at once for both are merely resistance to 
motion— inertia resistance to all motion or change of motion — 
weight resistance to motion upwards 

but there is a difference in these two kinds of resistance to 
motion inertia is instantaneous weight is continuous resistance 
any momentary impulse which acts upon a free body overcomes its 
inertia for it changes its motion and this change onv effected 
the inertia opposes any return to the former condition as well as 
any additional change the inertia is thus overcome by a momen 
tary force but the weight can only be overcome by a continuous 
iorce like itself if an impulse act in opposition to the weight it 
may for a moment neutralize or overcome the weight but if it be 
not continued the weight resumes its effect and restores the con 
dition which existed before the impulse acted 

but weight not only produces rest when it is resisted but mo 
tion when it is not resisted weight is measured by the reaction 
which would balance it but when unbalanced it produces motion 
and the velocity of this motion increases constantly now what 
determines the velocity thus produced in a given time or its rate of 
increase what determines it to have one magnitude rather than 
another to this we must evidently reply the inera when 
weight produces motion the inertia is the reaction which makes the 
motion determinate the accumulated motion produced by the 
gotiod of unbalanced weight is as determinate a condition as the 
equilibriup produced by balanced weight in both cases the con 
dition of the bgdy acted on is determined by the opposition of the 
action and reaction 

hence inertia is the reaction which opppses the weight when 
unbalanced but by the conception of action and reaction as 
mutually determining and determined they are measured by eoth 
other and hence the inertia is necessarily proportional to the 
weight 

but when we have reached this conclusion the origin objection 
may be again urged against it it may be said that there must bo 
some fallacy in this reasoning for it proves a state of things to be 
necessary when we can so easily conceive a contrary state of things 



all matter is heavy 


 

tb it denied the opponent may ask that we can readily imagine 
a state of things in which bodies hare no weight is not the 
uniform tendency of all bodies in the same direction not only not 
necessary but not eren true for the do in reality tend not 
with exual forces in parallel lines but to a center with noequal 
forces according to their position and we can conceive these 
dierences of intensity and direction in the force to be greater 
than they really are and can with equal ease suppose the force to 
disappear altogether • 

to this reply that certainly we may conceive the weight of 
bodies to vary in intensity and direction and by an additional effort 
of imagination may conceive the weight to vanish but that in all 
these suppositions even in the extreme one we must suppose the 
rule to be universal if any bodies have weight all bodies must 
have weight if the direction of weight be different iu different 
points this direction must still vary according to the law of con 
iinuity and the same is true of the intensity of the weight for if 
this were not so the rest and motion the velocity and direction 
the permanence and change of bodies as to their mechanical con 
dition would be arbitrary and incoherent they would not be sub 
ject to mechanical ideas that is not to ideas at all and hence 
these conditions of objects would in fact be inconceivable in 
order that the universe may be possible that is may fall under the 
conditions of intelligible conceptions wo must be able to conceive a 
body at rest but the rest of bodies except in the absolute nega 
tion of all force implies the equilibrium of opposite forces and 
one of these opposite forces must be a general force as weight in 
order that the universe may be governed by general conditions 
and this general force by the conception of force may produce 
motion as well as equilibrium and this motion again must be 
determined and determined by general conditions which cannoh 
be except the communication of motion be regulated by pn inertia 
proportional to the weight 

but it will be asked is it then pretended that newton experi 
ment by which it was intended to prove inertia proportional to 
weight does really pro nothing but what may be demonstrated a 
priori could we know without experiment that all bodies— 
gold iron wood cork — have inertia proportional to their weight 
and to this we reply that experiment holds the same place in the 
establishment of this as of the other fundamental doctrines of 
mechanics intercourse with the external world is requisite for 
developing our ideas measurement of phenomena is needed to fix 
our conceptions and to render them precise but the result of our 



 


appendix k 


experimental studies is tiiat we reach a position in which our con 
victions do not rest upon experiment we learn by observation 
truths of which we afterwards see the necessity this is the t aae 
with the jaws of motion p i have repeatedly endeavoured to slmw 
the same will appear to bo the case with the proposition that 
bodies of different kinds have their inertia proportional to their 
weight 

for bodies of thg same hind have their inertia proportional to 
their weight both quantities being proportional to the uuitity of 
matter and if we compress the same quantity of matter into iialf 
the space neither the weight nor the inertia is altered because 
these depend on the quantity of matter alone but in this way we 
obtain a body of twice the density and in the same manner we 
obtain a body of any other density therefore whatever be the 
density the inertia is proportional to tlic quantity of matter but 
the mechanical relations of bodies cannot depend upon any dif 
ference of hindi except a difference of density for if we suppose 
any fundamental difference of lueclmnioal nature in the particles or 
component elements of bodies we are led to the same conclusion 
of arbitrary atid therefore impossible results wliicdi we deduced 
from this supposition with regard to weigiit therefore all bodies 
of different density and iience all bodies wliatevcr must have tlieir 
inertia proportional to their weight 

hence we see that the propositions that all bodies are heavy 
and tliat inertia is proportional to weight necessarily follow from 
those fundamental ideas which we unavoidably employ in all attempts 
to reason concerning the mechanical relations f bodies this con 
clusion may perhaps appear the more startling to many because 
they have been accustomed to expect that fundamental ideas and 
their relations should be selfevident at our first contemplation of 
hem this however is far from being the cose as have already 
shown it is not the firsts but the roost complete and developed 
condition of our conceptions wjiich enables us to see what are 
axiomatic trulfis in each province of human speculation our fun 
damental ideas are necessary conditions of knowledge universal 
forms of intuition inherent types oc mental development they 
may even be termed if any one chooses results of connate intel 
lectual tendencies but we cannot term them innate ideas without 
calling up a large array of false opinions for innate ideas were 
considered as capable of composition but by no means of simplifica 
tion as most perfect in tbeir original condition as to be found if 
any where in the most uneducated and most uncultivated minds 
as the same in all ages nations and stages of intelleotual culture 



all matter is heavy 


 

as capable of being referred to at once and made the basis of u 
reasonings without any special acuteness or effort in all which 
circumstances the fundamental ideas of which we have spoken 
are opposed to innate ideas so understoodw 
 shall not however here prosecute this subject t will only 
remark that fundamental ideas as wc view them are not only 
not innate in any usual or useful sense but they are not necessarily 
ultimate elements of our knowledge they are the results of our 
analysis so far as wc have yet prosecuted it hut ihey may them 
selves subsequently be analysed it may hereafter appear that 
what we have treated as different fundamental ideas have in fact 
a connexion at some point below the structure which wc erect 
upon them for instance we treat of the mechanical ideas of force 
matter and the like as distinct from the idea of substance yet 
the principle of measuring the quantity of matter by its weight 
wliich we have deduced from mechanical ideas is applied to deter 
mine the substances which enter into the composition of bodies 
the idea of substance supplies the axiom that the whole quantity 
of matter of a compound body is equal to the sum of the quantities 
of mutter of its elements the mechanical ideas of force and matter 
lead tie to infer that the quantity both of the whole and its parts 
must bo measured by their weights substance may for some pur 
poses be described as that to which xropertieb belong matter in 
like manner may bo described as that which resists force the 
former involves the idea of permanent being the utter the idea 
of causation there may bo some elevated point of view from 
which these ideas maf be seen to run together but even if this be 
so it will by no means affect the validity of reasonings founded 
upon these notions when duly determined and developed if we 
once adopt a view of the nature of knowledge which makes nec 
sary truth possible at all we need be little embarrassed by finding 
how closely connected different necessary truths are and liflw often 
in exploring towards their roots different branches appear to spring 
from the same stem
