preface 



this manual of logic is humble in its size and form 
of publication but in its principles it pretends to 
originality and in its purpose to interfere with 
doctrines that have been advocated by some of the 
profoundest teachers of our kind i wish therefore 
in this preface to excuse such presumption as this 
very statement carries with it and to soften as 
well as i can the prejudice which i may raise by 
making it 

first then for my pretensions to originality i 
think i have the good fortune to start in this work 
with a few selfevident or nearly selfevident prin 
ciples which have been overlooked by all who have 
gone before me in this department of learning 
what they are and how they affect the kind of 
instruction here proposed will appear on an exami 
nation of the work but i may as well indicate them 
at present in order that the critical examiner may 
be prepared to trace their effect in the detail which 
follows in the first place i think it all but self 
evident if not quite so that every single word com 
petently used is the sign of knowledge and that in 
calling it the sign of an idea we either mean the 
same thing or we have no distinct definite meaning 

m 



vi preface 

in so using the term idea secondly it appears to 
me another selfevident truth that every act of the 
natural understanding which increases or which 
develops our knowledge involves three things the 
thing newlyknown or newlyrecognized the thing 
or things in some relation to it by being aware of 
which relation it is newly or better known and 
the knowledge itself which knowledge it is the 
privilege of our species to entertain separately 
apart abstractly so as to be applicable to other 
things hypothetically in order by inquiry to push 
our knowledge further if to others as to myself 
this statement should not convey a selfevident truth 
i believe the obstruction to be no other than will be 
removed by the examples furnished in various 
places throughout this work thirdly it appears 
also selfevident to me and with less difficulty than 
attends the previous statement will i think appear 
evident to others that words which join to make 
sense lose their separate their more abstract 
meaning in a meaning which they unite to signify 
so that the longest expression which can be formed 
by words that in this manner make sense are but 
as one single word with reference to the sense which 
is thus attained and signified 

such are the principles few simple and self 
evident or very nearly so which have never 
theless been overlooked or at least not considered 
up to their full weight by those who have formed 
systems of logic especially by aristotle and his 
followers by those who in any past days have 



preface vii 

speculated on the laws of human thought and on 
the origin the nature and possible compass of 
human knowledge i take these principles with 
me in the execution of the little work which follows 
with what success must be judged by its contents 

but while i speak thus confidently of the ground 
i take i feel and am ready to acknowledge with deep 
humility the imperfections that must be discovered 
in what i have done to build upon it it is one 
thing to plan and another to execute and every 
one even from the size of my volume will be ready 
at once to say parturiunt monies nascitur c 

there is another preconceived objection which i 
cannot help feeling will stand in my way i am 
nobody i belong to no learned body i have pre 
viously produced nothing that the world has much 
regarded may i be permitted without the charge 
of unnecessarily speaking of myself to make such a 
statement as with impartial persons will i trust 
have some weight against this objection 

a man can but do what the short space of life 
allows and if his time has not been occupied in 
pursuits adverse to and calling him away from 
some one pursuit in which he takes an interest he 
may achieve in that one pursuit as much as another 
he may achieve much more than others of far 
greater natural powers if he comes after them and 
takes up what they have begun but left unfinished 
such i believe to be my predicament nor do i 
come forward for the first time with the fruits of 
my inquiries twenty years ago i published in 



viii preface 

theory what i now offer in a practical work having 
had abundant opportunity in the intervening years 
of testing with pupils of various age and of every 
degree of competency the effect of such instruction 
as the following pages contain 

and now if it be asked what sect or denomination 
of past teachers in logic and speculative science i 
adhere to i answer to none i have endeavoured 
to keep clear of all extremes in opinion i am not a 
sensationalist with the french philosophers i am 
not an idealist with the german i give no coun 
tenance to materialism and i hold not with 
berkeley that there is nothing outward to the 
mind i am not of the scottish school for i see no 
scientific ground for a philosophy of the mind in 
contradistinction to a philosophy of matter or as a 
part of the philosophy of man yet fitted to be treated 
distinctly from man i wonder therefore that mr 
morell in his able history of modern philosophy 
should have placed me among the english 
metaphysicians the following pages will i think 
take me out of that category and leave me purely 
english 

on points transcending philosophy i do not 
declare my creed for those are points that lie 
beyond the limits of such a work as this and i 
think the cause of religion is never served by forcing 
religious considerations into science of human origin 
the structure built from the earth ought indeed to 
prove its own truth by meeting and coinciding with 
truth that comes from the skies and it must 



preface ix 

coincide either now or eventually for he who 
gives the light from above also gives the power to 
raise the edifice from below it is happy for me 
that what i happen to have reached or imagine i 
have reached of truth in these pages does not in 
any part stand in contradiction to the doctrines of 
the bible 



something remains by way of advertisement to 
my readers i have placed in the index at the 
end some points that i was glad to exclude from the 
body of the work for instance under the word 
locke i have indicated in what manner both locke 
and home tooke after beginning well went com 
pletely astray i conceive myself nevertheless to be 
a follower of those two men and only hope i have 
escaped the errors of my masters if i have not 
been able thus to avoid other controversial points in 
making up what i intend for a practical work yet i 
have so placed the more abstruse matter that the 
learner may quite avoid it in pursuing his first 
course of instruction for his guidance and that 
of the teacher who may not have time and oppor 
tunity to extract a better plan i have given an 
outline for a first course of logic in the appendix 
under philosophy philosophers in the index i have 
furnished a brief memorial of the changes in specu 
lative opinion among the greeks and a still slighter 
intimation of the movement of such opinion into 
times comparatively modern should the reader 
desire an account to the same purpose something

chapter i 
outline theory of logic 

 logic is a branch of learning connected with grammar 
and rhetoric while grammar looks only to correctness of 
construction or properly putting the parts of speech together 
so that they shall be accurate forms of language and rhe 
toric varies those forms in order to make them expressive of 
emotion logic looks to the sense which language has to con 
vey clear from any emotion which may or may not be its 
effect the sense of any single word is the knowledge which 
it signifies the sense of two or more words put together is 
the development of the knowledge included or assumed to 
be included in each of the separate words and meeting in 
the more particular knowledge which the two or more words 
unite to express thus red denotes the knowledge of what 
red is derived from a great many particular things earth 
denotes the knowledge of what an earth is derived in the 
same way while red earth which is one expression for one 
meaning indicates the development of the previous know 
ledge in one of the particulars assumed to be already included 
in the knowledge denoted by each separate word we may 
call red and earth the premises of a conclusion which must 
rationally follow from their union we may call red earth the 
conclusion from these premises 

 the process of the understanding by which knowledge 
is accumulated and included under a sign is called induction 
the process by which the knowledge so accumulated is spread 
again before the understanding in words which being joined 
together make evident sense that is to say make one ex 
pression with one meaning is called deduction 

 the logical function of a word is one thing its gram 
matical function another logical completeness is one thing 
and grammatical completeness another take the four words 



 manual of logic chap i 

every man is mortal separately an each has a separate 
meaning each is tin sim of knovlidji tin gramnl 
function is something added to this its logical iunrti n lut 
being added it has this jljt that we are required not t 
in the meaning of the separate parts but to go on till a whole 
is formed out of the parts and to understand that whole as 
one expression for one meaning but logical com pi 
may or may not coincide with grammatical completeness 
the construction is complete when we say every man is 
mortal yet we may go on developing our know 
of expression grammatically independent of each oth 
win n we add to the foregoing expression every jung is a man 
these two expressions which are grammatically 
the same ground of logical connection as the folio 
which are grammatical parts of one construction a kii 
every other man and is mortal in both instan 
pressions signify premises involving a conclusion in t in 
former instance the conclusion must be expressed lil 
premises in a sentence of independent form therefore every 
kimj is mortal in the other instance we have but to put the 
two grammatical parts together and the same conclusion will 
be signified as like every other man is mortal 

 every one who learns and uses a language learn s 
practises logic both iwlurtivrly and deduct iv ly a book on 
logic can do nothing more and therefore ought to propose 
nothing more than to assist this practice by untold 
theory in order that the practice may as far as possible be 
free from the mistakes and failures to which all pran 
liable which is unsupported by correspondent theoretical 
knowledge 

note to chapter i 

to any one acquainted with the science of the formal syllogism it 
will at once appear that the art or practice shadowed out in 
brfof motions must be a logic distinct from aritt i 
it is the logic of our race with reference to which fact we may 
our logic the logic in use that always has been in use by mankind in 
cluding the aristotelians themselves when not occupied within their 
qgpecial domain with this declaration we might pass on and leave the 
aristotelians to themselves if their since were not asserted to be the 
theory of our logic the science of reasoning as it is exercised by all man

kind through the instrumentality of language one writer indeed under

of the present day in scholastic learning appears to repudiate although 
himself an advocate of formal logic any blending of it with other doctrine 
censuring in a very learned article of the edinburgh review april 
 the attempts lately made to conciliate to the declining study a broader 
interest than its own dr whately then of oxford now the arch 
bishop of dublin has eminently succeeded in an attempt thus charac 
terized of him the reviewer says that he is a very shrewd and what 
is rarer in oxford a very independent thinker the effect of dr 
whatelys oxford education joined to his shrewdness and independence of 
mind has been this that the logic of aristotle rejected by philosophy 
since she succeeded in throwing off the trammels imposed by the school 
men has through him regained a footing in some places which but for 
him she had lost for ever oxford as the reviewer observes being 
the only british seminary where the study of logicproper formal logic 
 can be said to have survived now as to this logic we are ready to 
admit before proceeding further with ours that it is a science and it is an 
art but a science and an art quite distinct from our logic reasserting 
that ours is the logic in use by mankind and what we have to say of 
dr whatelys treatise is that it owes its popularity not to what it con 
tains of aristotelian logic but in spite of what it contains by the excel 
lence of the matter which he erroneously arrogates as a part of that logic 
had his volume presented nothing but what pertains to formal logic we 
might have left him to whatever arguments can be found in its favour 
but in order to bring it back into respect he far transcends its proper 
sphere first alleging what is not true that all reasoning whatever has 
its foundation in the principle of the formal syllogism he proceeds to dis 
course with admirable intelligence and skill on the many causes of faulty 
induction the notice of which properly belongs only to such a work as 
the present such for instance as the errors imbibed through the instru 
mentality of language the force of prejudice on our thoughts the crudi 
ties engendered by imperfect systems which kind of matter we affirm to 
have no proper place within the limits of formal logic how true an ob 
servation is the following a fallacy which stated barely would not 
deceive even a child may deceive half the world when diluted into a 
volume logic of fallacies iii of the soundness of this re 
mark it would not be easy to find a better instance than dr whatelys 
own volume let the logic of aristotle stand separate and alone and it 
cannot be saved from the neglect into which it was confessedly falling 
dilute it through the excellent but distinct matter which forms the bulk 
of dr whatelys volume and half the world are inclined in its favour 
of the half world thus biassed one part will be incapable and the rest 
indisposed that is too idle to dissipate the superinduced error for as 
dr whately says in another place there is probably not one person in 
ten who is physically capable of the degree of steady application requisite 
for embracing the principles of logic or any other science and a much 

 wonderful to say chiefly in america the country celebrated for

greater number to whom this though not an impossibility is a very great 
difficulty preface early editions thus then it is possible that ir 
whatelys logic may have ajuird a temporary popularity in spite 
of a radical hfcct which when known must vitiate the whole as a 
system though what is unfairly made a part of that system cannot be de 
prived of its independent merit and this possible defect we assert to be 
actual the formal syllogism which h makes the basis of his 
is not the basis of all reasoning it is a purely graminitid ront i 
for reducing every other form of expression to one single form without 
any change of the mental act by which the knowledge signified was re 
ceived the things of sense inevitably suggest unnumbered nlar 
the understanding the following is only one of them that it a t 
contained in or under another and this under a third the first is contained 
under the third but so plastic is language by the possible variation of 
terms of propositions and of larger forms of discourse all of whirr 
differ as jrammat ical forms only without corresponding differences in the 
reasoning mind that we can if we please express any other understood 
relation in the form strictly appropriate to one through which 
bility we have a science of which the enunciation of the one particular 
relation referred to above is the axiom while the art gram 

inatical art is the reduction of every expression to the one form 
the axiom may be applied to it and a demonstration scientifically ensue 
in all cases this will be a demonstration of what is already inevitably un 
derstood as dugald stewart says the demonstration of a dem 
tion and the practice will he so far as we keep to the practice which 
belong to the science that dismissing fmm the mind the things concern 
ing which we reason we shall reason with the words and nt imiir 
concerning the things the knowledge of which is included in the words 
briefly we shall reason with words and not by means of wori 
latter of which is proposed by our logic the value of this art and 
science needs not be here discussed all we mean at present is to assert 
its distinctness from our logic more about it will be learned as we pro 
ceed it may be sufficient to have stated thus much now with the hope 
that what cannot be made quite clear to our student in the present stage 
of his progress will become so as he advances 



chapter ii 
inductive logic 

 inductive logic is the art or practice of gathering know 
ledge by the instrunicntalitv of words in every act pertain 
ing to this practice three things occur the knowledge which 
the word already includes the thing known by reason of this 
previous knowledge and the increased knowledge which in 
cludes some other thing or thinu r what follows will it ls 
hoped make this doctrine understood 



sec induction theory 

theory of inductive logic 

 we use a word inductively when having some certain 
knowledge which it represents we advance by its assistance 
to further knowledge which we draw under or into the same 
sign let us suppose the word red was originally an excla 
mation uttered on first becoming conscious of that sensation 
and let us suppose that it subsequently loses its exclamative 
character and remains a sign of that fist knowledge when 
the sensation reoccurs the knowledge reoccurs and with it 
the sign and by the aid of the sign we are able to entertain 
our first knowledge of what red is distinctly from the varying 
circumstances of its reoccurrence and to include under it 
what is common to both occasions of knowledge to include 
for instance under the same word red the knowledge derived 
from the red of the crocus and from the red of a certain 
earth and thus we go on including with our greater expe 
rience more and more knowledge under the same sign till we 
have extended its meaning as far as convenience or the custom 
of language allows 

 let us take the word man as another example let us sup 
pose it was at first an exclamation uttered on first having 
knowledge of a creature that was not ones self yet was like 
ones self let us suppose it to lose its exclamative character 
and to remain a sign of that first knowledge when another 
occasion of similar knowledge occurs the former knowledge 
occurs with it and the sign enables us to include what is 
common to both occasions to include for instance under 
the same word man the knowledge of what a man is derived 
from the tall dark man and the short fair man and thus we 
go on till we include under the same sign all attainable know 
ledge of our species as distinguished from creatures of every 
other species 

 let us take the word john as a third example let us sup 
pose that this was at first an exclamation uttered when we 
first knew john distinctly from self let us suppose it to lose 

 if we know nothing except by reason of something already known it 
is a fair question to ask how our knowledge can have had a beginning 
this question which needs not stop us here i have endeavoured to answer 
in beginnings of a new school of metaphysics second essay sequel 
page 



 manual of logic chap ii 

its exclamative character and to remain as a sign of this our 
first knowledge of john when another occasion of knowing 
john occurs the former knowledge occurs with it and we 
now know him distinctly from each occasion in particular 
from the occasion when he was walking cheerful in the gar 
den and this new occasion when he is lying sorrowful on the 
bed thus we go on augmenting our knowledge of john 
by familiarity with him under various circumstances of his 
existence and including this knowledge in the sign which is 
his proper name 

 let us take the word proud or pride as a fourth example 
let us suppose it to have been an exclamation when for the 
first time some one person was known to treat another 
proudly let it lose its exclamative character and remain a 
sign of that first knowledge the next occasion of similar 
knowledge may be quite different in persons and circum 
stances yet with the aid of the sign we are able to hold 
our knowledge of what it is to be proud or to have pride 
distinctly from the variable circumstances and by the same 
aid we can go on increasing this knowledge by deriving it 
from a larger and larger number of instances and including 
our enlarged knowledge in the sign which helps us onward 
to still larger 

 we shall better understand the previous representation 
of the manner in which our knowledge is increased and of the 
use of signs in fixing and helping it onward by a few further 
considerations 

first we have to consider that all our knowledge is origi 
nally derived from the things of sense yet a sensation is 

 this as it is well known is lockes doctrine a doctrine which 
carried out on mistaken principles by some of his followers particularly 
in france has issued in what is called sensationalism the philosophers 
of this school propose to show that all ideas begin by being sensations 
which doctrine another school of philosophers chiefly germans oppose by 
what is called hciliin or the assertion of certain principles or original 
ideas existing in or being a part of the mind itself extremes of opinion 
seldom foil to be erroneous and as seldom does it happen that before 
the extremes ire reached there is not in whatever opposing doctrines 
some truth on both sides with regard to the statement in the text if 
taken in connection with what immediately follows ly it can scarce 
ml nee to either of the parties just alluded to the idealists cani 
that we reduce everything to sensation nor can the sensationalists aver 



sec induction theory 

not knowledge nor can it by itself create or be created 
into knowledge there must be a knowing faculty or capacity 
to know now to know a thing is to be aware of its rela 
tion or relations to some other thing or things to know red 
for example there must be something else known at the same 
time with it we must know blue black or white c at 
the same time that we know red wherever there is know 
ledge there are therefore premises of which that knowledge 
is the conclusion and red expresses a conclusion out of such 
premises neither do we know what man is but by know 
ing at the same time what is not a man neither do we know 
john as an individual but by being aware of johns existence 
distinctly from the changeable circumstances of his existence 
neither do we know what it is to be proud or have pride but 
by knowing what it is not to be proud in all these instances 
and in all other instances it is the same the word which 
signifies knowledge signifies a conclusion arising out of pre 
mises 

in this process of gathering knowledge we suppose the 
previous knowledge and the new phenomena to be so brought 
before the intellect that an inference instantly arises but 
new phenomena often present themselves under circumstances 
that ought to occasion doubt and we then exert or ought to 
exert some consideration before we admit an inference which 
is called a use of our judgement this is a voluntary act 
and upon it we lay the blame or praise of the inference we 
have for example a new substance before us which seems to 
be an earth and we include it under that name if it turn 
out not to be an earth we say our judgement has deceived us 
and what we calculated upon as warranting a conclusion in 
the deductive process remains a faulty inference in the induc 
tive this observation was proper to be made in this place 
though it needs not further impede the development of the 
theory in progress 

 secondly then to go on with our theoretical develop 
ment we have to consider that a sign cannot legitimately 

that we suppose the existence of original ideas inasmuch as we go no 
further than the supposition of a power or capacity to receive knowledge 
although as it should seem contrarily to the sensationalists we affirm it 
to be a power or capacity distinct from the capacity or liability to have 
sensations 



 manual of logic chap ii 

signify more knowledge than we have attained and that of 
such knowledge it may signify just so much as our immediate 
purpose requires we may for instance use the word red 
only as the sign of knowledge derived from the experience of 
one thing that produces the sensation and from want of ex 
perience or by choice we may exclude from the meaning of 
the word the varieties of red derived from a wider experience 
for which by the custom of speech the word may be the 
sign we may use the word man through ignorance or by 
choice only to signify our knowledge of what a man is dis 
tinctly from a boy or a woman we may use the word john 
by necessity or choice to signify no more knowledge of him 
than the slightest acquaintance gives to any person and not 
even so much knowledge as this but only the knowledge that 
john exists or has existed as an individual person we may 
use the word proud or pride only as the sign of knowledge de 
rived from the single action of one single person toward another 
and not include under it that wider knowledge which greater 
experience brings in all these instances and all single 
words would but multiply the instances the sign is legiti 
mately used provided our knowledge and the sign are co 
extensive and we do not confuse our natural understanding 
by using the sign to supply the place of knowledge 

 but thirdly we have to consider that all our knowledge 
is not gained by our own experience we depend as a race 
in a very great degree on the experience of others and take 
our knowledge in large proportion on credit hence we 
embrace as our own knowledge all the credible parts of past 
history all that is reported to us of credible present history 
nay all the facts of experimental science which others and 
not ourselves have arrived at and which we may have never 
witnessed but believe to be 

 and while with the assistance of a carefully applied 
logic we are becoming by experience and by fairly received 
testimony better and better acquainted with the real world 
there is an ideal world always enlarging which we have to 
keep clearly understood in its relation to the other our 
senses after having been operated upon by the things fitted 
to affect them are not quiescent even when the things are no 
longer present the nerves of those senses work internally 
though the outward organs are not impressed and the things 



sec induction theory 

reappear but in such a manner that we cannot fail to dis 
tinguish them from the realities unless in a state of sleep 
when the realities are quite absent or in certain states of 
disease which preternaturally affect the nerves of those senses 
supposing then a healthy waking state of the faculties we 
have to keep our knowledge of the one world clear from any 
confusion which must arise from mingling the things of the 
other as a part of it and this point being secured we find 
that as transcripts of the things of the real world those of the 
ideal materially assist the understanding in the inductive part 
of learning 

note to the previous section 

the ideal world here spoken of does not consist of the ideas of platonic 
philosophy these under our own point of view we have to speak of in 
the next section it is a transcript of the outward world as it has reached 
the understanding through the senses but the character of this ideal 
world must depend on the senses through which it has been received 
we commonly mean by it a transcript of the visual world now this it 
cannot be to one born blind or so early deprived of sight as to be equally 
circumstanced yet such a one witness blacklock the blind poet of 
scotland has an ideal world as complete apparently even for poetry 
as the ideal world of him who enjoys the full sense of vision do we 
not attribute to sight as the inlet of the ideal world spoken of a greater 
instrumentality in the reception of our earliest knowledge than it can fairly 
claim i have before me what i consider a most able philosophical 
treatise communicated by the author of whom i know nothing beyond 
the favour of his gift sent without date or mention of residence the title 
of which is the principles of geometrical demonstration deduced 
from the original conceptions of space and form by h wedgwood 
ma late fellow of chr coll camb taylor and walton in 
following out which deduction the author shows that not our visual but 
our tactual impressions are the early inlet of all the fundamental know 
ledge placed within the reach of our species 

 in pursuing the theory of inductive logic we next find 
that beyond the things of sense and the ideal things that 
reflect them there are things the pure abstract stores of the 
understanding in following the relations of which the under 
standing enjoys a peculiar triumph as moving in a world 
entirely its own these things are properly called transcendental 
or metaphysical because they transcend real and ideal things 
because they lie beyond the bounds of nature every single

word whatever has its immediate corivspondonce with such a 
thing and only through tin medium here indicated has it a 
correspondence with the things of sense that is to say 
knowledge itself is always metaphysical though the things 
we first know are always things physical the knowledge 
for instance which we have of red is not itself either the 
real or the ideal sensation of red but something above or 
beyond it the knowledge which we have of john is not 
john himself and it transcends or is abstract from our actual 
perception of him and from any idea that is image of him 
which we distinctly form since in either of these cases john 
must be perceived or conceived sitting standing lying or 
walking sick or well older or younger while the knowledge 
we have of john though it includes all these circumstances 
as they have arisen in our experience is nevertheless separate 
from them since to know john is to know him distinctly 
from and beyond those variable circumstances and from and 
beyond every other variable circumstance that has arisen in 
our experience or may arise t the knowledge which we 



 not distinguishing between these is the fundamental error of the 
sensationalits mr lames mill who is one of them lays it down as a 
fact that to be in pain and to be conscious of pain is one and the same 
tiling it sroms so indeed because in the recollected experience of every 
one of ms they always come together but if any one had existed in a 
single continued state of pain from the moment when sensitive being com 
menced it may seem strange to say but philosophical reflection will 
shv it to be true he would be in what we call pain yet would not 
know what it was which is only another way of saying he would not 
be conscious of it if further words could make plainer what perhaps is 
beyond the reach of an understanding that requires more than a few 
minutes reflection to embrace it we might say that one unchanging state 
of existence such as we have supposed would not be a state that happens 
to the person it would be his very existence his very self we know 
or are conscious of pain because we know what is not pain what is relief 
from pain what is pleasure so we know pleasure because we know 
pain we know good because we know evil and evil because we know 
good

have of man transcends in like manner the perception or 
conception of any man in particular and the knowledge 
we include under the word proud or pride is knowledge 
abstracted or separated from any other knowledge we entertain 
of the persons who are proud now though all knowledge is 
originally derived from the things of sense and is of value to 
us here only in proportion as it is reapplicable to them yet 
we have the power as we advance in knowledge to dismiss 
the real and ideal things from which it is derived and to 
begin with the knowledge abstract from the things as the 
ground of a higher kind of knowledge a knowledge which is 
often distinctly called science thus for instance without 
any regard to the real or ideal points or straight lines or 
circles that originally suggested our knowledge we can take 
the knowledge as the ground of knowledge to spring from it 
in which proceeding the point is not something we can see 
or feel or imagine we can see or feel the straight line is 
not something straight relatively to something that we can 
see or feel to be crooked the circle is not the circle of the 
sun or of the full moon but the point the straight line the 
circle is separate from the times and the things that first 
made us know what a point is what a straight line is what 
a circle is 

note to section 

in a foregoing note the former foot note above we attempted a stand 
against the sensationalists we may now attempt one against the idealists 
in order if possible to keep the medium in which the truth is generally 
found the philosophers last named inculcate after their own manner 
the old platonic doctrine of ideas which exist originally in the mind and 
give form and consistency to all the things of sense this is an extreme 
which inasmuch as it is improved and wiprovable our slow steps cannot 
reach neither can we see any necessity for supposing these ideas while 
we admit on the other hand against the sensationalists that the things 
of sense could give us nothing but sensations if there existed not a distinct 
power or distinct powers through which we have knowledge also that 
is through which we are aware how the things producing sensation stand 
related to ourselves and still with relation to ourselves stand related to 
each other we admit with an eminent english idealist that sensa 
tions are not transformed into ideas see whewelps philosophy of the 
inductive sciences aphorisms concerning ideas and we admit stipu 
lating for our own mode of interpretation that they are informed namely 
that they are received by the understanding in order to take the character 
of knowledge our objection to the theory of ideas as a mode of accounting 
for the fact being this that inasmuch as it is a gratuitous doctrine it

carries mystery with it such a we think must leave good t

in short we admit thus much and n iimn that tin things of sense 
are adapted to reach mans intellect through his senses and that hi

which they stand t each other but always with a regard to himself

which will appear tin more reasonable by reflecting that among these

which ve in vain sek the originals in the outward world let us take 
one of thes id as to serve for the rest and see how with our views we 
ran explain its existence let it be the idea as it is called of a 
line now we admit that there is no line in nature which we cai 
to be straight nav that there is no line in nature which pr 
straight and consequently that no idea in our sense of the word idea 
namely a mental transcript of the outward thing reflects to us that which 

i i nly straight whence then do we obtain the knowledge of what 
it is to be straight independently of these physical conditions whence 
in other words do we get at the metaphysical straight line 
that the fact is sufficiently interpreted when we admit what uivly cannot 
be denied that all knowledge is abstract and consequently free from 
physical conditions ami our knowledge of the special fact before us thus 

 we have before us a line which is sensibly crooked and another 
which relatively to the former is straight our original knowledge of 
the straight is therefore the relatively straight but t know 

ledge becomes an abstraction by merely setting aside all the particular 
instances which led to it and then our knowledge is expressed by this 
definition that a straight line is a line which is not crooked in this 
way though our knowledge began with the rcltti we are 

able to speak of what is straight absolutely but we speak of it in words 
only the tiling itvlf is unknown either as existing or possible to exist 
how apiin say tin idealits could you speak of the absolutely straight 
unless the previous ijct in their sense of idea existed in the mind we 
answer that we are able to do so by a repetition of the process which has 
just lieen indicated to the human understanding nothing absolute exists 
in reality but the vtfivc absolute but the abstraction of that know 
dsts in calling this abstraction an utm kant and the other 
idealists dwell upon the tact and make much out of the fact that it lies 
beyond the limits of time and space this of course we do n i 
we object only to the vv of their explanation let it be admitted 
that a metaphysical straight line exists only in our knowledge of what a 
straight line is namely a line that is not crooked to such knowledge it 
matters not whether the thinj exists or not the knowledge h 
i reapplicable to every line which is straight to our senses that is 
rcliticli straight if if were not so reapplicable it would be an 
abstraction of no use but to darken understanding with the apiarance of 
knowledge

practical remarks based on the foregoing theory 

 the use of words to fix our knowledge and carry it 
onward to further knowledge is the true process of inductive 
logic but it too often happens that words are used to hide 
the want of knowledge not only from others but even from the 
thinker himself the education which is conducted through 
the medium of books makes a young person familiar with 
words far more rapidly than he can become acquainted with 
things nor would there be mischief in this if he were aware 
of his real ignorance if he regarded the words which he 
hears or reads or repeats by rote as signs to a very great 
extent not of what he yet knows but of what he has to learn 
the danger is that he will deceive both himself and others 
by mistaking his familiarity with the signs of knowledge for 
the knowledge itself nor can anything be said to warn him 
against this error which has not often been said before the 
common sense of mankind independently of theory having 
prescribed to the young student from time immemorial the 
duty of asking himself what meaning he has with every word 
he uses or professes to understand and the necessity of 
betaking himself to the ordinary ways of learning when his 
knowledge falls short of his language one powerful method 
of bringing him to a consciousness of his deficiencies in the 
inductive process of logic will be to require from him proofs 
of his knowledge in deductive essays or themes the nature 
and methods of which are to be spoken of hereafter these 
essays it is expected will be an occasion of frequently send 
ing him back to the inductive process to supply what has 
been unconsciously omitted in the meantime he may be 
saved from a great deal of fruitless use of words by attention 
to the following considerations 

 all unrevealed knowledge springs originally from the 
things of sense and though in its nature abstract from those 
things its truth or reality can be tested only by its reappli 
cability to those things by our own experience meaning of 
course the experience of our kind we can know nothing 
beyond these things and though it is the height of presump 
tion to believe that nothing beyond our experience remains to 
be known yet it is almost equal presumption to pretend that 
we do or can of ourselves know more into such presumption

however we are often led ly the empty abstractions which 
language generates lai bo talk an 

think with little knowledge with lss knowledge and even 
lievond this with no knowledge at all the error in any of 
its derives arises out of the power of abstracting knowledge 
from nalities and in its extreme it will always be found 
to consist in using a sign where nothing at all is signified 
except our inability to carry our knowledge further we 
must go back to our previous theory in order to ma 
general caution proper v understood 

 in the metaphysis of juantity we are saved from 
wandering among prooflcss abstractions bv t aj 
plicability of those abstractions to tin tilings of sense and 
during the progress of our learning we are at every step 
reminded of the connection betwen the two for in 
between the metaphvsical point or line or circle and 

int line or circle by the sensible or ideal representa 
tion we carry with us 

 so likewise in making red or john or man the subject 
of our thoughts although each word corresponds imme 
diatelv with an attraction vt w are saved from inutility 
of thought by the constant reoccurrence to our sen of til 
individual things from which our knowledge and 
to which the word is immediately reapplicable so as to 
prevent the danger of supposing we know what we are par 
tially or wholly ignorant of 

 such however is the mechanism of language that a 
word may not only signify the abstract knowledge of a real 
thing or real things and this is what every word must 
signify if it signifies anything because knowledge is by its 
nature abstract from the thing known but the word before 
it descends to the real thing or things may be the name of 
an abstraction which abstraction if it means anything means 
the knowledge of the real things which suggested it let the 
following be our example of the manner in which this double 
abstraction takes place suppose the word proud to have 
been originally a proper name applied to an individual from 
his known character no delusion of thought is likely to 
arise while the word is so applied and understood suppose 
in the second place that the word is used adjectively before 
the proper name of another person as proud john in which 



sec induction practice 

application the word indicates that john and the former 
person are understood to agree in character again no delu 
sion of thought is likely to arise for though we may for a 
moment have understood under the word proud something 
separate from john yet the grammatical form of the word 
will have prevented our resting in that separate meaning 
beyond the first moment on the junction of the two words 
we understand them as one name for one thing and are in no 
danger of confounding the metaphysical separation and dis 
tinctness with a real distinctness of supposing for an 
instant because proud and john are two words that john is 
resolvable into two correspondent things but when without 
any change in the logical import we change the grammatical 
function of the word when instead of proud we say pride 
we take the word away from that which would realize its 
meaning and render it not merely the sign of abstract know 
ledge but the name of an abstraction and we have in conse 
quence to descend a step lower before we get to the realities 
which that abstraction includes or ought to include as the 
things known by it now the danger is that the thinker or 
reasoner may never have begun with or may never go back 
to take this lower step that he may discourse to himself or 
others concerning pride passion or apathy or glory or 
shame without knowing by experience precisely what he 
means in which case his discourse must be vain wisdom 
all and false philosophy 

 it is further to be remembered by way of caution that 
the forms of language into which abstract names are joined 
contribute in no small degree to a delusive use of words in 
the acquirement of knowledge we speak for instance of 
the pride of john or johns pride of pride belonging to john 
or john possessing pride in phrases of the same form as when 

 others apart other devils sat on a hill retired 
in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high 
of providence foreknowledge will and fate 
fixedfate freewill foreknowledgeabsolute 
and found no end in wandering mazes lost 
of good and evil much they argued then 
of happiness and final misery 
passion and apathy and glory and shame 
vain wisdom all and false philosophy

that tinre is no such real tiling pride distinct from john

real things as the brother of john and the houses belonging 
to john distinct from john himself that is to say pride is a

 suppose in the next place that there is nothing 
within the reach of our human powers to which a word or 
phrasr is applicable the proper interpretation of such word or 
phrase when attempted to be so applied is that it stands 
as the sign of our ignorance when we say infinite or end

know of those things is space endless relatively to our 
selves time endless relatively to ourselves what time or 
space may be beyond our experience of what it has been 
and what it continues to be we know not we can take 
the known portions of time or of think of such 

portions as still going on but this is time or space unended 
and not endless unless as before said we understand t 
to mean rdnticely to ourselves that is only so far as our 
race can have experience the same reasoning belongs 
to such words as absolute perfect complete we know 
nothing and can know nothing but the n lute the

bring the nature of that being within the reach of our facul

used they are serviceable elements in the structure of human 
language this indeed is the only way in which empty 
abstractions that is abstractions which throw realities quite 
out of question can be legitimately used and our system of 
inductive logic having reached this point makes no pretence to 
go beyond it 

note to section 

and just where we leave off metaphysics in their usual form and 
purpose begin especially the metaphysics of germany the strength of 
the systems which arise in that country of interminable speculation 
consists in their being improvable for how shall we set about disproving 
that which as it lies beyond the reach of proof is equally beyond the 
reach of contradiction the german philosophers employ the abstractions 
all of which are obtained originally from the things of sense to interpret 
things which lie completely beyond our present state of existence so 
employed and so applied they are hypotheses and if it were possible to 
establish them by inductive proofs we might accept them on credit till the 
proofs were added but the proofs are impossible and the demand is 
preposterous that we shall accept mere supposition for science call these 
systems romances and we may dip into them perhaps without danger 
that they are nothing more is evidenced by the fact that one of them is 
no sooner promulgated than it gives occasion to another to dispute its 
pretension kant is succeeded by fichte fichte by schelling schelling 
by hegel a kaleidoscope has not more shapes for the eye than meta 
physics for the german mind the mischief is that these systems 
pretend to be more than romances they pretend to carry the human 
intellect into the impenetrable unknown which everywhere surrounds us 
a lively faith can irradiate this unknown with a light from itself and 
take away all its gloom without pretending to see into it with the eyes of 
human reason but these metaphysical romancers come with false lights 
offering what they call science in place of faith tomorrow fichte is 
reported to have said in the adjournment of the next point of his lecture 
 tomorrow we shall create god had his pretence been only to offer 
a romance the announcement though profane would have been harmless 
for who as he proceeded would have been ready to say i believe in 
fichte the maker of god 

recapitulation of distinctions and differences 

 all knowledge is abstract that is separate and of a 
different nature from the things that originally suggest it 
these things are real things the things of sense and the way 
in which we unavoidably understand them is that they exist 
distinctly from oneself but beside real things there are 
things ideal and things metaphysical which become the 
subjects of knowledge 

 ideal things are those which we imagine to exist dis 



 manual of xxic chap ii 

tinctly from oneself by a voluntary delusion which our i 
knowledge can at any time set aside as a fairy a gorgon lilli 
put of ideal things sonic are altogether fanciful but others 
are more or less accurate representations of ival things that 
are or have been as london adam leviathan babylon 

 a thing metaphysical is a state of ones thinking 
which state we can make the subject of higher knowledge it 
is dillireiit both from real and ideal things though liable to 
be confounded with them thus the metaph ial straight 
line or circle the moment it is realized or imagined cea 

be metaphysical thus though we can personifv virtus or 
pride we cannot in any other way think of pride or of virtue 
as having real existence but we can know what 
and vbltpride is that is we can know a certain state ol 
thinking self as having been a state of previous knowledge 
the knowledge that such and such men acted in a 
manner so as to be approved in the one case to oftlnd in 
a certain way in the other if indeed we have no such pre 
vious knowledge and yet talk of virtue or of pride the words 
are empty names that only serve to conceal ignorance 

 all words that are parts of speech are signs of things 
metaphysical but some of them can be immediately applied 
as names of things real or ideal while others can be aj 
only as names of things metaphysical thus the name john 
the name of a familiar friend although it signifies our know 
ledge of him abstractly from all the circumstances under 
which we have known him can be reapplied to him in 
connection with any circumstances under which we may know 
him again thus the name man the name of any one of our 
species although it signifies our knowledge of what our species 
is abstractly from any one of our species can be reapplied 
to any one of that species but the name virtue or 
cannot be applied to any thing real or to any thing 
except by poetical personification it can be applied only as 
the name of previous knowledge and if we have not the 
previous knowledge it is an empty name 

hence then there are names of things reed of things ideal 
and of things abstract or metaphysical 

 in grammar it was found useful to borrow from logic 
the distinction of names into names proper common and 
abstract a proper name is a name immediately applicable 



sec induction practice 

to some one particular real or ideal person or thing as john 
london jupiter lilliput a common name is a name that 
can be immediately applied to a person or thing with reference 
at the same time to the class or kind of things to which the 
person or thing belongs whether real or ideal as man fairy 
a name abstract is a name not applicable to a real or ideal 
person or thing except by personification but only to a 
state of knowledge under which we apprehend something 
concerning real or ideal persons or things as virtue pride 
but a name abstract may become a name common if we make 
it a name for several states of knowledge thus the name 
virtue may be a common name for the special virtues prudence 
justice temperance fortitude or faith hope charity 

 language is the instrument of reason by which we 
collect knowledge so that it shall be ready for reapplication 
to the things known in order to serve its purpose language 
is very flexible and the logician in availing himself of the 
changeable import of a word has to notice its etymo 
logical sense its general sense and its particular or 
applied senses 

 the etymological sense of a word is its original sense 
so far as we are able to trace it thus the original sense of 
to prevent is to go before the original sense of a villain is 
one who lives in a vill or small town the original meaning of 
a regiment is rule or command or something ruled or com 
manded the original meaning of the word thing is that 
concerning which we think 

 the general sense of a word is that which includes 
under it all more particular or special senses sometimes 
this coincides with the etymological sense as regiment when 
it means every thing that is ruled or commanded which sense 
will include the special object a body of soldiers commanded 
by a colonel the general sense of the word man is that 
which includes every human being male and female in every 
stage of life the general meaning of animal is that which 
includes every organized being that is liable to sensations of 
pleasure and pain the general meaning of the word plant is 
that which includes every organized being that is destitute of 
sensation the general meaning of the word sensation is that 
which includes every effect pleasurable indifferent or painful 
which reaches the brain of an animal by the operation of an 



 mantal of logic chap ii 

external cause the general meaning of the word fl 
that which includes every possible subject of our thoughts 
real ideal and metaphysical and this general sense coincides 
with the etymological i 

 the special sensef of a word is some limited applica 
tion deduced or deducible from its general sense thus the 
name man may be specially applied to any human being not a 
lemal nor a hoy or infant thus the word animal is some 
tinies applied to a brute animal only thus the word regiment 
while it had a general meaning was often special iv applied to 
a body of soldiers commanded by a colonel w h 
meaning has now become the common meaning and the 
general meaning is now almost forgotten 

 in the use of signs to advance and fix knowledge it 
appears that there may occur abstraction generalization and 
specialization 

 abstraction is the separation of knowledge from the 
tiling known it is the beginning of knowledge there being 
no such thing as knowledge till abstraction takes place and 
abstraction is carried on by the use of language the word 
john may have first meant john an infa m his nurses 
lap but when we know john under other circumstance 
knowledge of him is abstract that is separate from those 
circumstances and not only is john the sign of abstraction 
from tin particular ciitimistainvs but every other word which 
helps to form the description of john is also the sign of 
abstraction from particular circumstances 

 generalization is the process of abstraction by means of 
a name made common to two individuals and applied succes 
sively to more individuals till we have included under it all 
we find useful to include thus the word man may ha 
meant a single individual and then it was a proper name it 
may then have been applied indifferently to two individuals 
by excluding what was peculiar to each and so it continued 
to be applied to three four five c till it became a name for 
any individual of the human kind 

 specialization j is the opposite of generalization and 

 that is external as regards the brain 

 in aristotelian logic any special sense of a word is called a second 
intention 

j j stuart mill is the originator of this useful philosophical term 



sec induction suggestions 

properly belongs to deductive logic because the ordinary way 
to make a word special is to join to it words that have that 
effect thus the word man is made partially special when 
we say a short old man in a brown coat but a single 
word is sometimes made to take a special meaning deduced 
from a meaning more general as the word doctor whose 
general and etymological meaning is a learned man but 
which sometimes means specially a man to whom the 
diploma of a degree bearing that name has been given by a 
university and sometimes in common or vulgar use one 
who undertakes to cure diseases whether he has received a 
university diploma or not a general word thus made special 
is an instrument of inductive logic as well as all other single 
words 

suggestions for avoiding dueing the inductive pro 
cess the delusions of the rhetorical sophist 

 sophistry is an unfair use of art in ehetoric in order 
for some partial end to make the worse appear the better 
cause the delusion indeed is not always designed the 
rhetorician as frequently cheating himself before he sets about 
misleading others but this makes no difference as to the 
likely prejudicial effect and our learner has to be warned 
against this effect while pursuing what every one pursues 
right or wrong during his life the logical process by 
which knowledge is stored up for subsequent development 

 one common means of delusion and the first we may 
mention because it will be the first against which the logi 
cian will be warned in his own deductive use of language is 
the use of highsounding verbiage he has already been cau 
tioned on this point particularly in sections and 
preceding but the caution cannot be too often repeated it 
is again urged in this place because when a point cannot be 
otherwise carried the rhetorician often addresses the ignorance 
of his hearers offering them sound for sense the empty 
parade of learned terms for the substance of learning even 
the substance becomes a snare when used to bewilder the 
understanding of the hearer or reader and keep him from 

 for the single word is not special in meaning but it merges its 
single meaning in the logical noun it helps to construct and the meaning 
of this logical noun is special

for being operated upon when off his guard by such means 
of delusion as it is the object of this section to characterize 

 f the next means of rhetorical delusion which may be 
mentioned is a means very much in use at the present day 
that of appending to an abstract or general proposition every 
special practical inference which it may suit the views of the 
reasoner to draw from it thus it having been said and in 
general terms safely said that wholesome food is food fit for 
our species and a certain article of food having been found 
wholesome by such and such a people we are required to act 
on the general admission and force its use on a different 
people now the proof that it is wholesome does not reach 
further than the experimented instances and our general ad 
mission cannot fairly be extended to such an issue with 
regard to people who live in another climate or under any 
other different circumstances the proof is yet to come and 
till it come the issue proposed is a practical nonsequitur

f a great part of what follows in the remaining four sections under 
the present head though not literally quoted from is suggested by the 
excellent matter contained in dr whatelys chapter or book on fallacies 
referred to in the previous note that the author of this manual has 
not been able to draw greater benefit from the chapter in question is 
caused as he thinks by the mischievous interference in it of aristotelian 
principles if dr whately had not predetermined to be more consistent 
than his fellow aristotelians if like them he had given up the doctrine 
of the formal syllogism when he came to treat on fallacies and spoken of 
them in the language of common sense the chapter which is now excel 
lent only in parts would have been excellent as a whole but dr 
whately unfortunately as the author thinks does his utmost to recon 
cile this part of his logic with what precedes chiding his brethren for 
having here renounced their science whenever he says they have 
to treat of anything that is beyond the mere elements of logic they totally 
lay aside all reference to the principles they have been occupied in esta 
blishing and explaining and have recourse to a loose vague and popular 
kind of language introd book iii the effect of dr whatelys 
greater consistency appears to be this that in endeavouring to draw a 
line between logical and nonlogical fallacies between what can be 
explained on the principles of aristotle and what must be explained ac 
cording to common sense he very much mystifies the latter mode of 
explanation while he is obliged to draw his intended line in so zigzag a 
way that for whatever purpose one cannot help thinking it had better 
not have been drawn at all

a case of having proved too little again we may allow 
that every one has a natural claim to be free but the admis 
sion of this in the abstract does not bind us to join in every 
special act which it may be cited to justify employed in 
this way it is an argument that proves too much for with 
lax unconditional interpretation it necessitates the freedom of 
madmen and of infants or idiots again we may very 
safely admit that a representative is one who represents 
others but from this general admission it can never be 
inferred in what particular manner he is bound to repr 
them it may be as their messenger it may be as their 
spokesman it may be as their delegate with special restricted 
powers it may be as the member of a legislative assembly 
what are his duties in any case or capacity whatever will 
evidently be undeterminable by the general signification of the 
word to ascertain these duties we must ask in what way 
by prescription or law or usage or power specially held and 
specially granted he is required to act these thn examples 
may stand for many others that might be given im 
such abstract terms as socialism communism equality fra 
ternity we may admit tin justness of nral definitions 
drawn from these and similar words but we are not bound 
to join in following out the definition into practical con 
sequences when we have no test from experience or custom to 
warrant our proceed 

 another means of rhetorical delusion is that f shifting 
from one sense of a word or a proposition to another so as to 
lead the logician in his inductive progress to admit the con 
clusion of the one sense as the conclusion of the other this 
delusion often takes place in thought without any exterior 
cause other than the equivocal character of the wrd 
 thus says dr whately a young divine per 
truth of the maxim that for the lower orders ones language 
cannot be too plain that is clear and perspicuous so as 
to require no learning nor ingenuity to understand it vhn 
he proceeds to practice the word plain indistinctly ilits before 
him as it ay ere and chocks him in the use of ornaments of 
style such as metaphor epithet antithesis c which are 
opposed to plainness in a totally different sense of the word

hence in many instances a dry and bald style which has 
no advantage in point of perspicuity and is least of all suited 
to the taste of the vulgar book iii the next exam 
ple is also from dr whately though with different arrange 
ment in saying he who necessarily goes or stays we 
may mean he who goes of necessity or stays of necessity or 
we may mean this alternative that he must either go or stay as 
his will may determine now the person under the former 
description is evidently not a free agent but the person under 
the latter has all the freedom which we can attribute to a free 
agent the sophist may however so conceal his transition 
from one of these two meanings to the other as to get an ad 
mission of the doctrine of universal absolute necessity the 
doctrine which insists that no man is in any case a free 
agent 

 a further means of rhetorical delusion is that of 
making a conclusion which is true of an aggregate appear to 
be true of the particulars of the aggregate or the reverse of 
this we need not notice the former mode at present 
because it can hardly be practised successfully on one who is 
not trammelled by the forms of the aristotelian syllogism a 
caution against the false forms of which has already been given 
above section and also because an occasion will occur 
for exhibiting some examples in chapter v section 
but the reverse of this mode of delusion may be here noticed 
namely that of making a conclusion which is true of the par 
ticulars of an aggregate appear to be true of the aggregate 
now there can hardly be a delusion in so plain a case as the 
following we conclude or more properly infer when in 
throwing dice a person casts two sixes now and then that he 
does so by what we call chance or good fortune but if he 
casts two sixes fifty or a hundred times running we can 
hardly be driven or seduced into the same inference reason 
guided by experience teaching us in such case some very dif 
ferent inference yet in cases not dissimilar a hearer or 
reader may by a juggle be led away from this natural proce 
dure of the understanding let our example take the form of 
a dialogue only be it observed the events supposed in it are 
prospective not determined tom i would advise you to 
resign your place immediately what in order that you

 perhaps the ivmuinin nnans of rhetorical dl 
inav be summed up by saying that they are all carried on with 
the purpose of keeping out of inch as possible the 

 articular point or points to which attention is required for 
the purpose of reaching the truth that ri 

immediate intends of the sophist if any accredited book of 
rhetoric had svsteinatied the particular means of carrying out 
such a purpose it would b the business of logic to oppose 
for the ik lit of its inductive learner a correspondent 
arrangement of means to avoid the several snares but what 
ever mav u the corruption of our nature in j 
not so lost as to tolerate such a system in theory any more 
than we tolerate a written art of poison seduction

tion the means to their purpose and it is for us to meet 
these artifices if not by instruction directed against each 
means in detail yet by general remarks which may indicate 
their common character and how they are designed to operate 
now the ordinary plan of calling off attention from an 
important questionable point is to refer to it as a point 
not questioned among the select wellinformed class of persons 
who are presumed to be the leaders of opinion by this 
plan a modest hearer or reader not included by his own 
modesty in the class may doubt the extent of his information 
so as to suppose that he has not reached the knowledge 
which persons of that select class enjoy the plan here 
spoken of may be carried out variously first for example 
the questionable point may be delayed till tle end of a long 
preliminary discourse a discourse not at all touching the par 
ticular point but dwelling on unquestionable generalities 
advanced all along on the understanding that they involve 
the particular point yet to come which point when it 
comes is stated as a thing of course that all persons of com 
petent information have already admitted or secondly the 
questionable point may be mingled with another about which 
there is no question and the two may be so shifted that at 
last they seem one and a conclusion may be insisted on which 
carries the questionable point though it truly carries only the 
other or thirdly the questionable point may be so put to 
the hearer or reader in the very form of a question that if he 
is seduced to answer it according to the form in which it is 
proposed and not according to the form in which the truth 
requires it to be proposed namely as being true or false 
he must give an answer suitable to the views of the sophist 
or fourthly a series of cases may be proposed as being all 
the cases to which respectively an answer can be given 
when there remains another case appertaining to the point at 
issue by omitting which the sophist secures a triumphant 
answer in favour of what it is his interest to prove more 
over any of these methods may receive considerable assistance 
from the tone or style of the rhetorical reasoner a tone 
or style indicating his connection with a high grade of 
thinkers and a disparagement of those who by then way of 
thinking prove themselves not to belong to the same high 
class some examples of these several observations they

be hypothetical may be necessary suppose the so 

phist desires to establish in the minds of his hanrs or 
iviits the questionable fact that a certain minister of stat 
corrupt using tin means iiist indicated he holds a long j 
liminary discourse on the baseness of those who being in 
places of high olitical trust abuse their power to serve their 
private ends and exciting in this manner a strung virtuous 
indignation without pointing to any person in particular 
the object of it he asks at last not whether a b is a man 
that deserves this indignation but assumes that he is known 
to deserve it except by people who are shut out by ti 
station from being acquainted with what is don in high 
plan ing so in words but implying as much by his 

tone or style and thus if his hearers or readers are not on 
their guard against the delusion he gains his point by keeping 
them mm the only inquiry which truth obliges tinin to ii

the sophist to lix it as a fact in his hearers or readers in 
that a certain root is not a chap article of food to all

calrulation accordingly the sophist begins with calculat 
elaborate and of th produce per acre of this article 

of food and of the other sliding in somewhere a a i

contains but a tenth part of the uutrit 

in the substances opposed to it now it i evident that all 
the previous calculations will most likely amount to nothing 
unless the last point is clearly established but instead of 

blishinu it the ivasoner by such an artitiv as this 
may contrive to make it pass for granted and thus his object 

jained suppose further in order to elucidate the second 
means of sophistry indicated above that the rheton 
wishes his hearers or readers to admit the necessity of tn 
porting criminals to a foreign colony mingle 

this questionable point with one concerning which there is no 
question namely that it is oeoessait to ijr crime in the 
parent country when bv passing frequently in a long dis

appear that the wy way of repressing crime in the parent 
country is the transportation of its felons to the infant settle

ment suppose once more in order to elucidate the third 
means of sophistry which the previous remarks hint at that 
the sophist wishes to establish it as a fact that a b evaded 
by a trick the full payment of his just debts instead of 
setting his hearers or readers to inquire whether such was the 
fact he may ask whether any one of them recollects the date 
of the fact or in order to elucidate the fourth means of 
sophistry spoken of above suppose the fact to be known that 
a b did compromise with his creditors but the question to 
remain whether it was through dishonesty or imprudence or 
unavoidable misfortune the sophist may stop his hearers 
or readers from inquiring into the probability of the last cause 
by asking whether it was through dishonesty or imprudence 
shutting out by this only alternative the thought of any 
other and lastly as to the power of a certain tone or 
style of speaking in eluding a questionable point we may sup 
pose for our example a sincere holder of some religious tenet 
to be thrown among unbelievers a sophist from among 
these instead of asking the grounds of the belief which he 
wishes to undermine and opposing them by direct argument 
may by speaking of them with banter and contempt as not 
worth an argument gain the end which he could not have 
reached by a direct road

definition 

 definition is the act of so fixing the limits of a term 
that nothing more nor less than it is intended to signify at the 
time shall be included in it it is an art growing out of the 
use of language and possible only by having words to operate 
with or signs equivalent to words its general purpose is 
to assist the natural understanding and this it accomplishes 
by subjecting all the knowledge acquired by it to one single 
relation not permanently to take place of those unnumbered 
relations under which the things we live among are appre 
hended for this would be not to assist our knowledge it 
would be to supplant it but that in the inductive and de 
ductive process we may stop at convenient stages and fix 
and connect and arrange by the one pervading relation the

win il of what wo know whether for the purpose of going on 
to increase our stock or of developing the stock acquired 
the art we speak of is an essential part f formal logic and 
a inom important part of ours the formal syllogism that 
which works by extremes and middle term would without 
it have been an impossible construction and with regard to 
our logic though it can in a certain degree or condition 
without it and does so exist in the practice of uneducated 
people yet in such condition it has no claim to rank 
than tin many ordinary arts which wo learn and practise 
without express instruction we therefore willingly b 
from formal logic this part of its doctrine the only part of 
it which is truly useful 

theory of logical definition 

 we have seen in the previous chapter sect that 
the power of a name to extend its comprehensiveness has no 
limits luit the want of further things to receive its meaning 
and hence we have names as thing being which include every 
possible subject of thought and if we hi i thus 

comprehensive the same process which led up to these will 
have produced others of lss and less dejivs of comprehen 
siveness till the names are those on which the process has 
not yet been tried that is to say proper names or the i 
of individuals as the process cnits in superinducing a 
relation upon the results of the natural understanding and 
therefore is an artificial process so though the prim 
always the same then are great differences of detail in apply 
ing it for instance almost every transcvndntalist 
own set of categories the summa genera under which he is 
led by the character of his inducth to marshal the 

developments of his understanding what these severally 
are needs not be stated lniv it is sufficient to say that not 
one of them exactly coincides with the views unfolded in this 
manual which therefore proposes its own categories namely 

 kxeept nottin or notbeing a name which shadowy as it is still 
keeps tli tact pivsrnt that wherever thiv is kimwl there ir

the distribution of all things which can be the subject of 
thought into thingsphysical and thingsmetaphysical the 
former of these subdividing into thingsreal and thingsideal 
now as to thingsideal since they are the counterparts or the 
compositions of thingsreal we need not pursue them dis 
tinctly from thingsreal but go on to speak of the subdivisions 
as equally belonging to both under their general denomination 
of thingsphysical there is an old division of real things 
into matter and mind a division which in our days has been 
thought sufficient to warrant an inductive system of philosophy 
built upon the latter so as to be distinct from the sciences 
professing to be concerned solely about the former whether 
this is or is not a sound purpose requires no discussion here 
it is sufficient to assert that though the distinction on which it 
is founded is a most convenient one for many logical ends 
it is one concerning which we can at present know nothing 
whatever we may believe further than that man is a being 
capable of constant progress in knowledge and raised in this 
respect above all other creatures perceptible by his senses 
we may state this fact by saying he has a mind but in so 
stating we do not explain or get beyond the fact as previously 
stated transferring then both matter and mind from the 
place sometimes assumed for them among thingsphysical to 



 be it well observed that what is here said interferes in no degree 
with the bible doctrine of mans immortality but goes quite along with 
it as far as on human grounds any doctrine can go nay even the 
platonic doctrine of the immortality of the soul a doctrine not identical 
with the bible doctrine though not contrary to it and therefore by be 
lievers often perhaps almost always joined to it even that doctrine is 
not contradicted by what is said above though its claim to scientific va 
lidity is questioned nor again do the remarks made above give any 
countenance to what is called materialism for if it asserts that mind is 
an abstraction that is not a thingphysical but metaphysical it asserts 
the same of matter whose existence as a substratum or common essence 
of all the things of sense is like the other point quite unsusceptible both 
of proof and disproof matter as far as we can know anything about it 
has its existence only in an arbitrary definition which comprehends just 
so many of the things of sense as experience in physical science points out 
to be expedient in the meantime what more rational to believe than that 
man however assimilated to the things of sense among which he is now 
placed is designed for immortality by having means within reach for 
regaining the perfection of a nature that evidently struggles to raise itself 
above them

what we deem their proper place namely among thins 
metaphysical we come next in our pi 
individual things to the domains of acknowledged inductive 
science and what shall here be the summa genera or heads 
of classification depends on the judgement of those who 
having experience in those wide domains are qualified 
experience to guide others all that logic proposes is to 
direct th pri triple of every classification not to lay duwn the 
classification itself that principle is easily state the 
summum genus or general name of the things alout which the 
science whatever it may be is conversant must be divided 
into subordinate heads each of these again into sabsubordinate 
heads and so on downwards till our last division brings us to 
the individual things by which our earliest know dp was 
suggested and for the better comprehension of which this 
systematizing principle has been put hi operation the word 
division be it here observed is not in describing the fore 
going operation used in the same sense as when used in 
speaking of the division of any natural substance into pa 
as for instance into halves quarters or eighths and so forth 
but it is used to signify what for common apprehe 
wq miht better sipiifv by the term ditribu 

tioii implying that the whole is spread ut remaining as a 
whole what it was our meaning above then oth 
stated is that the chief head i spread out into subordi 
nate heads each ni thee again into sulsul ordinal heads 
and so on till the lowest heads can but be spread out into 
the individuals of which thev consist now it matters 
not what the chief head or the subordinate heads or the sub 
subordinate heads are called we have only to remember 
that in logic the names employed are commonly these 
summum yen us for the chief head genus for each of the heads 
under it nulialtern genus for each of the subsubordinate heads 
and for each of as many more as may be subjected to each of 
these till we come to the proximum genus or that next above 
the species and then under each species we have only indivi 
duals be it observed however that every subaltern genus 
is a species with relation to the genus immediately above it 



 as for instance instead of the names which follow above we may 
use those of class order genus species variety 



sec j theory of definition 

and therefore every such genus is a proximum genus with 
relation to such species so much for the application of the 
principle to physical things returning now to thingsmeta 
physical we have this important observation to make that 
as they have their existence only in the understanding so the 
enunciation of them in the form of definition must always if 
the enunciation is adequate be equivalent to the things them 
selves as for instance the definitions of a point a line a 
circle c in mathematics the definitions of virtue vice 
pride passion and apathy and glory and shame and so 
on with the terms of double abstraction in whatever other 
science 

 such are the effects described generally of superinducing 
the indicated one relation upon all the knowledge which the 
natural understanding collects it is this that renders logical 
definition possible uneducated persons do not define they 
describe that is to say when they try to convey their know 
ledge to others they refer only to individual things distin 
guishing these from each other by every variety of mark 
through which they differ to the natural understanding and 
this indeed is knowledge the knowledge enjoyed by our 
species at large and logic in its superinduction of one uni 
versal relation to connect and arrange this knowledge is a 
most useful minister to knowledge but when beyond this 
it builds an art of reasoning upon its own arbitrary arrange 
ment in order to take the place of or even to explain the 
natural acts of the understanding it then becomes so far as it 
can attain its purpose a mischievous innovator instead of a 
useful minister we say so far as it can attain its purpose 
which purpose fully attained would be to put words arti 
ficially explained in place of thought derived from things to 
reason with words instead of by means of words but in fact 
the aristotelians never have reached this point in perfecting 
their art fortunately in one respect but unfortunately in 
another since if it could have been carried fully out its 
monstrous pretensions would have been earlier discovered 
but the bulk of mankind never have been drawn into the use 
of their artificial syllogism and even themselves nay even 
in illustrating that syllogism have in general used informal

shapes as suggesting meaning more readily than the strict 
forms of their own syllogism yet with these hindrances to 
its presumed mischievous effect the predominance of aristo 
telian logic in the schools of europe during several ayjes was 
accompanied by a sign sufficiently indicative of mischief some 
where namely by activity in learning without progress and 
without fruit inquiry during that time moved only in a 
circle and he who left his place of education at twenty 
of age was sure to find if he visited it at sixty the same 
questions going on which employed him in his youth when 
philosophy spread her wing to reach the height she is still 
seeking the trammels of the aristotelian syllogism dropped 
from her whether as effect or as cause is immaterial the 
fact itself is too notorious to be called in question 

practical distinctions and directions grounded on the 
foregoing theory 

 definitions are nominal or reed again real definitions 
are accidental or essential and again ossential definitions 
are either purelylogical or phy ideological 

 a nominal definition is one that is so only by name 
and not in reality or it may be otherwise explained by 
si i vino that it dvs but put one name for another on the sup 
position that the one substituted is more in use and conse 
quently better understood thus we inav diine nonentity by 
nothiixj hiiidtt by inborn periphery by circumference mono 
logue by soliloquy in a nominal definition only one word 
must be used or if more than one it must be such a combi 
nation as is understood in the manner of one word for if we 
collect a meaning from two or more words then there is a 
development of knowledge and the definition u a ival one 

 in this arrangement and in the meaning of some of the terms i have 
felt it necessary to deviate from dr whately he justly points out that 
kominal and kal s la after others explains them furnish a distinct or 
cross division as ivards the division into accidental physical and logical 
a act which he complains that his brethren have overlooked s 
have introduced confusion and perplexity i hope i avoid confusion by 
not making cntinil and h division ir i do not use the terms 

in the same souses as dr whately although in sense which custom fully 
warrants further i do not follow him in the unqualified contradistinc 
tion of physical from logical definitions my reasons for which may be 
collected from the foregoing theory 



sec definition practical distinctions 

in defining man a humanbeing or explaining to prevent by 
the correspondent expression to gobefore the two words in 
each definition would most likely be taken as the syllables of 
a single word and if so taken the definition is a nominal 
one it is also a nominal definition though the words may 
be several which repeats the word to be explained in another 
grammatical shape as when we say justice is the quality of 
being justj 

 a real definition that is a definition in reality j is an 
explanation developed in some form of two or more words 
with the effect that the thing defined is referred to some class 
and the difference in some way indicated between it and the 
other things of its class if ve say john is always talking of 
himself we declare a fact concerning john but we do not use 
any form of definition if however we say john is a man that 
is always talking of himself we do use a loose form of definition 
inasmuch as we refer our subject to his class or kind man 

 the student will bear in mind that whenever the meaning is collected 
out of words put together to suggest it there is the logical process of 
premises and a conclusion see chapter i but in combinations of fre 
quent and familiar occurrence the logical process has become unnecessary 
and of such combinations we receive the meaning at once as we receive it 
from single words the description applies to all the familiar phrases of 
common speech 

f a subject which is sui generis hardly admits other than a nominal 
definition as for instance time or space so far as these can be un 
derstood by human faculties every one capable of thought has a full 
understanding of them to explain them to one who did not already know 
what they are would be impossible we may say time is the measure 
of duration space is the measure of extent but a clock and a surveyors 
rod would with almost as much propriety come under these definitions 
though the one is better called a measurer of time chronometer and 
the other a measurer of space chorometer perhaps the nearest ap 
proach we can make to a real definition of time is that which exists 
between and coexists with events and of space that which is 
occupied by the tangible things of sense or deemed tangible and exists 
where they are not kant denies the objectivity of time and space 
making them parts of the mind itself receptacles into which the matter 
is poured which the understanding subsequently forms into the things of 
the material universe we may safely leave this dogma to the fate of 
german metaphysics in general contradicting as it does a conviction quite 
as strong as that which attaches to all other things that we deem external 

j for be it observed real is not here used in the restricted sense 
assigned to it when we oppose it to ideal but in its common and looser 



 manual of logic chap iii 

and then indicate the difference between him and men in 
general every form of real definition strict or loose has 
these two parts namely kind and difference thus in defining 
man a rational animal the latter term animal implies the kind 
or genus and rational the difference which is here called the 
specific difference 

 an accidental definition commonly called a description 
is that w r hich explains a thing by its properties or accidents 
now a property is something which uniformly belongs to a 
subject but is not so present to the understanding as i 
thought at the moment essential however it may be so we 
say for instance that it is the property of a triangle not its 
essence to have its three angles equal to two right 
but that it is its essence not its property to have three 
sides an accident differs from a property by being separable 
from a subject as for instance to be right or obtuse or acute 
is separable from the subject angle in its general sense in 
other words we may say that to be right obtuse or acute 
is accidental to an angle generally though essential to each 
species so when we define or describe john as a man ttat s 
always talking of himself we describe him by what is accidental 
to his kind though essential to johns sp cial rharaetr but 
we might go on describing him by anidnts that are not essen 
tial as for instance that he lives in mich a 
and such rompanv and so forth all of which niav fnn parts 
in our definition or description and all bing to what is 
called an accidental dd in it ion we have nxt i 
observe that though we can define or describe an individual 
thing by what are purely accidental to it as when we d 
an individual plant by saying it is a rosebush growing at the 
farther end of the southmill and nr in full blossom yet we 
cannot so define or describe a kind of tiling we then in order 
to form an accidental definition or description have recor 
the properties of the kind as for instance in describing what

and form having wittin it a principle of life aucl decaying 
wlien that principle is no longer active the description might 
be lengthened to any extent by adding other properties of 
plants and the whole would be an accidental definition 



sec definition practical distinctions 

 an essential definition is one that limits its subject to 
that extent neither more nor less to which we design to adhere 
in our subsequent inductive or deductive process a purpose 
which it accomplishes by adding to its proximum genus its 
specific or characteristic difference thus we define a square 
by calling it an equilateral rectangle where rectangle is the 
proximum genus and equilateral the specific difference and 
in a similar manner we define man by calling him a ra 
tional animal an essential definition is either purelylogical 
or physicological purely logical when the subject is meta 
physical or transcending nature physicological when the 
subject is a natural object or embraces natural objects 
thus of the two definitions used as examples above the 
former is purely logical the other physicologicalf it is 
true that a naturalist might not be satisfied with the definition 
given of man but this would be only because it employs 
not the mode of limitation which his system requires he 
might find it necessary for his end to define man a mammal 
having two hands with thumbs opposdble to the fingers and three 
kinds of teeth cutting canine and grinding but the other 
definition though formed with a different purpose as regards 
the future deductive process is a physicological definition as 
well as the latter in the latter the characteristics forming the 
specific difference namely having two hands c have reference 
to a different artificial genus namely mammal thus various 
for the different purposes of development are physicological 
definitions and if so it will be readily conceived that those 

 we say subject when we refer to what exists only in the under 
standing namely the knowledge of what an outward thing is distinct 
from the outward thing so understood we say object when we refer to 
this outward thing hence the distinction into subjective and objective 
which will occur in some future statements 

f it must be borne in mind that physical things in our view include 
both real and ideal things and hence the definition of an ideal thing 
for instance of a phoenix as a bird fabled so and so is a physicological 
definition 

j genus and difference if not capable of being respectively signified 
by a mere grammatical substantive and mere grammatical adjective will 
nevertheless still be so signified by constructed expressions equivalent to 
those two parts of speech that is to say by what in principles of 
grammar are called a logical substantive and a logical adjective here 
amammal is the logical substantive what remains of the definition 
the logical adjective 



 manual of logic chap iii 

purely logical must bo still more subject to the choice or 
arbitrary determination of the thinker in forming these he 
is under no more than a prudential restraint as for instance 
the custom of language which ought to prevent him from 
defining a word quite apart from its usual meaning one 
thing he has always to remember that whatever limitation 
he chooses to give to the meaning of a word to that he should 
strictly adhere in his subsequent development suppose for 
instance that he has defined pride to be inordinate self 
esteem he could not under such a definition justly propose 
in any branch of his development to treat of a proper or de 
cent pride for the very purpose is contradictory to accom 
plish the purpose his original or some secondary definition 
must assign a less limited meaning to the subject as for in 
stance by calling it selfesteem simply and then treating of 
it under the heads of an improper and a proper selfesteem 

first note to chapter iii 

it may assist the student to the better understanding and application of 
what precedes to quote however we may have anticipated them the 
following rules and cautions from dr whatelys logic u first the 
definition must be that is neither ton exttiive nor too narrow 
for the thing defined for example to define fish an animal that 
ihr rtr would le ton extensive because many inets and other crea 
tures live in the water to define it an mutual thit has an airbladder 
would be too narrow because many fish are without any or again if 
in a definition of money you should specify its being made of metal that 
would be too narnw as excluding the hells used as money in some parts 
of africa if again you should define it as tu art in ex 

change for soik tiin that would be too wide as it would include 
things exchanged hy barter and observe that such a defect in a defini 
tion cannot be remedied by making an arbitrary exception if for in 
stance a person were to give such a definition mcapu i as should include 
land without meaning to have included it and should then propose to 
remedy the fault by saying that capital is 

adetcriptio except ivm secondly the definition must be in itself 
plainer than the thing defined else it would not explain it in itself 
plainer that is generally because to some particular person the term 
defined may happen to be even more familiar and better understood than 
the language of the definition and thirdly though this rule may be 
considered as included in the rule just given the definition should be 
couched in a convenient number of appropriate words figurative words 
are opposed to appropriate and are apt to produce ambiguity or indistinct 
ness too great brevity may occasion obscurity and too great prolixity 
confusion tautology which is a distinct fault from prolixity or 
verbosity must also be avoided that is tautology which consists in in 



sec definition practical distinctions 

serting too much not in mere words but in sense not so as too much 
to narrow the definition in opposition to rule first by excluding some 
things which belong to the class of the thing defined but only so as to 
state something which has been already implied thus to define a paral 
lelogram a foursided figure whose opposite sides are parallel and equal 
would be tautological because though it is true that such a figure and 
such alone is a parallelogram the equality of the sides is implied in their 
being parallel and may be proved from it now the insertion of the 
words and equal leaves and indeed leads a reader to suppose that there 
may be a foursided figure whose opposite sides are parallel but not equal 
though therefore such a definition asserts nothing false it leads to a sup 
position of what is false and consequently is to be regarded as an incor 
rect definition the effect may be further illustrated by the following 
examples if it be laid down that he who breaks into an empty house 
shall receive a certain punishment it may be inferred that this punish 
ment will not be incurred by breaking into an inhabited house if it be 
called a crime for people to violate the property of a humane landlord who 
lives among them it may perhaps be inferred that it is no crime to violate 
the property of a landlord who is not humane or is an absentee 

second note to chapter iii 

connected with the laws of definition and indeed involved in them is 
the fixing of preliminary conditions at least in the mind before we enter 
on a dispute or discussion it should be settled for instance what is the 
ground of dispute is it a real or verbal question that is a question 
concerning facts or a question concerning the application of a word a 
dispute otherwise interminable may often be cut short if not adjusted by 
the application of this test two persons are disputing whether a b 
was a man of genius are you it may be said by one of them are 
you agreed with me that he was capable of such and such productions if 
so it is a question about the application of a word and now let us see in 
what way custom authorizes the use of the word and what sense agrees 
with our present meaning or suppose the parties use the word in 
exactly the same sense then the dispute turns on facts or the character of 
the facts to ascertain which recourse must be had to inquiry comparison 
and general estimation further the logician should be aware that on 
many questions which are given out for the express purpose of provoking 
discussion a sensible person would express no opinion unless he were per 
mitted to qualify it thus for instance the often mooted question is 
a public or private education preferable this as a general question 
cannot be rationally answered we ought to know exactly what the 
education is which under each denomination is proposed to be given as 
well as the disposition of the person who is to be subjected to it and his 
ulterior prospects in life thus limited the question would present itself 
in a very different shape and probably leave room for little or no dif 
ference of opinion in the wars which closed with the pacification of paris 
in was great britain more indebted to her army or her navy 
such a question in an assembly composed of the two different interests 
would probably have produced some few years ago a very animated dis

sec theory of deductive logic 



theory of deductive logic 

 we have seen that in the inductive process every act 
of the understanding includes three things the thing known 
the thing by which it is known and the knowledge gained 
being gained the knowledge remains abstract from the 
things not indeed ever present to consciousness but revivable 
upon occasions that require it by the presence of real or of 
ideal things or by means of a sign audible or visible but 
when the knowledge is revived by its proper occasion it does 
not always bring with it all the things which suggested it 
and we have to develop these things by that conscious effort 
which we call thinking this is in other words to go back 
to the steps not exactly which would scarcely be possible 
but virtually to the steps which led to our knowledge and 
such development is the practice of deductive logic which 
development never includes in strict theory more than we 
already know thus for instance we may meet with some 
instance of kingly magnificence which awes our thoughts so 
that we understand for a moment such condition of man as 
something different from the ordinary lot of humanity but 
considering afterwards as a part of our knowledge already 
acquired that a king is but a man we shall conclude that 
kings are not exempted from the lot of other men but like 
them are mortal the development of such knowledge may 
be expressed in words by a single proposition namely 
 kings who are but men are mortal or it may be ex 
pressed in three propositions which represent the three 
things that originally constituted our knowledge namely 
 every man is mortal every king is a man 
therefore every king is mortal when we develop our 
knowledge in this manner the three propositions are a syl 
logism when we develop it in any other way which forces 
assent from a person possessed of the presupposed knowledge 
the syllogism is virtually included in the expression because 
the three things which the syllogism represents are included 
in every act of the understanding hence the syllogism is 
properly resorted to in all cases of doubt or difficulty for the 
purpose of testing the knowledge gained with relation to the 
conclusion which it necessarily includes 



 manual of logic chap iv 

note to section 

our syllogism is the informal syllogism by which is meant the syl 
logism that makes no use of the doctrine of comparison between extr in 
and middle terms which belong only to the doctrine of the formal syl 
logism of aristotk the syllogism given as our example above happens 
to exhibit those terms in the construction of the several propositions but 
this is accidental to our syllogism and not essential or important in 
our doctrine each premise of the syllogism is one expnsion with one 
meaning and in the instance above is the statement in each of a 
known truth or fact but these facts are no sooner stated in connection 
than they inevitably suggest the conclusion which is expressed by the 
third and the whole of them are now one expression with one meaning 
to ask why they are so or to take in hand a demonstration of what is 
thus attained is a question and a proceeding as absurd as it would be to 
ask why a rose is fragrant and to set about a verbal demonstration that 
it is so accordingly with men of sense and education but not so edu 
cated as to be trammelled by scholastic logic the syllogism in actual use 
is the informal syllogism and to this they have recourse when in the 
inductive process not being quite satisfied with the grounds on which 
they have come to some inference they deduce the process in a syllogism 
that so the grounds and the conclusion inevitable in the deduction may 
be clearly set forth and the defect if any may be seen which fault will 
always be found in the premises ami never in the conclusion 

but say the aristotlians that is they who arc trammelled by scho 
lastic logic we find in the practice of reducing all to the 
demonstration of extremes and middle term a wonderful nwer in sharp 
ening tin intellect it may be so riddles charades and conundrums 
have this power also but is it an exercise which sharpens the intellect 
for the hih practical purposes of life may not a person acquire great 
skill in the reduction of reasoning to the aristotelian formulas without 
any benefit nay even with prejudice to the natural powers of the under 
standing exerted for the ends just alluded to he who makes use of a 
complicated instrument to effect that which nature has fitted him to do 
with his naked hand may possibly fail in usin the instrument though 
he could not fail in usin the natural means we reserve our proofs of 
what is in re suuested only as possible to another opportunity if we 
shall be able to show that dr whately himself is guilty of a gross fallacy 
that of the circle in endeavouring to establish the claims of the 
telian syllogism the cause of the error must be set down in him not to 
the want of great natural judgement which dr whately of all men 
cannot be accused of but to some defect in the emplovment of his instru 
mental means of coming at his conclusion see the next chapter sec 
lion 

there is an enormous delusion in the doctrine of the aristotelian syl 
logism which may be taken notice of before concluding this note in 
this doctrine it is pretended that the reasoning process can be exhibited 
distinct from the subjectmatter of reasoning what we affirm and the 
affirmation we presume carries conviction along with it is that where 
there is no subjectmatter to be understood there can be nothing under 



sec theory of deductive logic 

stood when we say y is x but z is y we affirm what is not true 
and there is no conclusion but if proviso is made that y shall be the 
same as x and z the same as y a conclusion follows and the cause is 
that by the proviso x y and z become real subjectmatter 

 but though in strict theory the development of know 
ledge never can include more than we already know we 
cannot in practice always distinguish between the inductive 
and the deductive process for in thinking that is in the 
effort to develop our knowledge it is the proper course when 
we do not find in our previous experience or accredited infor 
mation sufficient ground for what we presume wq know to 
go back to the inductive process in order to collect the proofs 
or disproofs of such presumed knowledge such proofs are 
called external arguments and in the practice of deductive 
logic they very often occur among the internal arguments 
which in strict theory are alone proper to deductive logic 
hence the principle of deductive logic as it is to be practically 
conducted may be laid down as follows it is to develop 
our knowledge by following it into that which is necessarily 
included in it but which we do not at once recognize as so 
included either from defect of attention or because our know 
ledge is assumed before we have legitimately reached it 

 every single word is as we have seen the sign of ab 
stract knowledge and if legitimately used includes all the 
steps by which the knowledge has been gained and every 
step was an act of the understanding which as already 
stated always implies the coexistence of three things now 
when the knowledge which we have abstracted to the utmost 
degree that our faculties can reach or the words we use 
can signify is to be deduced and specially applied the 
universal method of logic is this to join words together 
which have a separate or abstract meaning so that each loses 
its abstract meaning by each helping the other to suggest a 
more special meaning the expression formed by the junction 
of the words becoming the instant they are joined only 
one expression for the one more special meaning this is 
what we called joining words together to make sense and it 
is presupposed that while they make sense they shall also 
make grammar that is be accurate forms of construction 
thus for instance red and earth are respectively signs of 
abstract knowledge so likewise are time and flies so like 



 manual of logic chap iv 

wise are every and man so likewise are is and mortal but 
red earth being joined make sense and are one expression for 
one meaning which meaning is special in comparison with 
the separate meaning of red and the separate meaning of 
earth the same is to be said of time flies and of every man 
and of is mortal when the respective words are joined and 
again with regard to the last two expressions each of which 
is now to be esteemed only one logical element or part of 
speech the moment we join them together we find they 
make sense and that sense is special in comparison with the 
separate meaning of every man and the separate meaning of 
is mortal 

 the grammatical function of a sign whether single or 
compounded of several that form one expression with one 
meaning does not affect the previous statement it is true 
that a sign whose form indicates that it is only a part of 
speech carries in that form a warning that we are not to 
rest in its separate meaning but to await the junction of 
another sign for some more special meaning intended but a 
sentence completely constructed though it does not carry the 
same warning in its form is nevertheless if not the final 
sentence but one of a link in the chain of expression by which 
the thought will at last be developed as much a part of 
speech as any individual word recognized by grammar as a 
part the complete logical expression or word is nothing 
less than the whole of the means used to develop the know 
ledge which the thinker chooses to unfold at the time and it 
may amount to a large discourse which being completed is 
one expression for the knowledge unfolded of which the 



 so man horse cards a horseback on o are each a single gram 
matical word each implying abstract knowledge again aman ahorse 
onhorscbctck ofcards are respectively signs of meaning less abstract 
that is of knowledge in a degree more specially developed the signs being 
formed of mere grammatical words joined by grammar and by logic and 
again amanonurx apackofcards are signs similarly formed 
of meaning still less abstract the examples a little improved on those 
in aldrich are given in whatelys logic book ii ch as in 
stances of simple apprehension incomplex and complex distinctions 
founded like the aristotelian doctrine generally on essentially wrong 
notions of the way in which language is the exponent of thought dr 
whately as if suspicious of the fact expresses himself with some caution 
in his later editions as compared with the earlier 



sac deductive logic practice 

several portions are properly deemed parts of speech in logic 
though devoid of forms to imply that they are parts in grammar 

 but though a sentence may be in logic and commonly 
is only a part of speech yet the difference adverted to 
namely that it does not carry in its form a warning to wait 
for meaning to come enables us to rest in its meaning if we 
please although the rest may be temporary a sentence 
may therefore be described as an expression thai proposes or 
lays before the thinker the development of his knowledge 
as time flies every man is mortal a king is but 
a man it is therefore called a proposition a grammatical 
part of speech only begins or continues or completes such a 
proposition and by its form indicates that it is to be under 
stood as doing no more for instance time man 
is every man time as it flies a king who is 
but a man these by their form are evidently only parts 
of propositions that is they are grammatical parts of speech 
among these we may distinguish from the mere grammatical 
parts such as though grammatical also exhibit a develop 
ment to a certain extent though not a development in which 
we rest such compounded parts of speech we have been 
taught in grammar grammar on its true basis to call 
logical parts of speech 

distinctions and directions to assist in the practice 
of deductive logic based on the foregoing theory 

 when we intend to develop our knowledge we have 
first to choose the form of expression by which the know 
ledge to be developed shall be signified the expression may 
be a single grammatical noun or a logical noun or a propo 
sition thus socrates man pride knowledge are single 
grammatical nouns the death of socrates the reason of 
man compared with the instinct of brutes pride of birth 
knowledge of the world are logical nouns knowledge is 
power virtue is its own reward it is education that forms the 
mind are propositions of these the subjects expressed by 
single words are the widest including an indefinite number of 
subordinate subjects to be expressed by logical nouns or by 
propositions the subjects expressed by logical nouns or by 
propositions are more limited but are still resolvable into 
subordinate subjects to be expressed in the same way 



 max ual of logic chap i v 

 when the subject to be developed is expressed lv a 
single word the first proof that can be given logically of the 
existence of the knowledge presumed to be included under it 
though the proof may not always be required is its expan 
sion in what is called a definition all knowledge consists 
in being aware of the relations in which the thing known 
stands to oneself and to other things suppose then a sub 
ject to be expressed by a single word it is almost ahvavs 
possible as we have seen in the previous chapter to class the 
subject with other things which are therefore said to be of 
the same genus or kind and then to distinguish it from these 
things by stating its difference genus and difference as 
there saw form a definition each of these may sometimes 
be expressed by a single word as in defining socrates to be a 
greek philosopher man to be a rational animal pride to be 
inoidinate selfesteem but it may not be possible and if 
possible it may not be sufficient for our object to begin thus 
briefly the development we propose or if we so begin we 
may add much more so that an essential definition becomes 
an accidental one or description thus we may cam out 
our diiinition of socrates into all the particulars of his life 
till the difference between socrates and others of his 
amounts to a biography of socrates suppose for another 
instance that we have to define so common a thing as a chair 
or a table it must be done by genus and difference by 
stating what hind of thing it is and how it differs from other 
things of its kind thus both chair and table may be called 
an article of furniture that is their genus of a chair the 
dillerence is so far raised from the ground and so adapted as 
to receive a person in a sitting posture of a table the differ 
ence is far raised rc and so adapted by having a fat 
surface as to hold readily for the hand whatever may be placed 
upon it again suppose we have to define such a subject 
as generosity we must first seek for a generic term such as 
sentiment and tlkn add words to specialize the term as 
 generosity is the sentiment which takes pleasure in conferring 
benefits there are wider meanings of the word than this 
but this may be all the meaning which the further develop 
ment is intended to carry out 

 if the subject to be developed is expressed by several 
words as for instance a knowledge of the world the general 



sec deductive logic practice 

term knowledge is evidently limited being in fact thus far 
developed still as with a subject expressed by a single 
word there will remain an indefinite number of points or pur 
poses of development at the choice of the thinker but if 
the subject is given in the shape of a proposition as a proper 
knowledge of the world is favourable to virtue there is then only 
this one proposition to be established in other words only 
one purpose of development now the means of develop 
ment are what are called arguments and we have next to 
inquire what is an argument 

 an argument often called a reason is a proposition 
whose truth being admitted the truth of the proposition 
which it is used to establish must also be admitted as 
 kings are mortal for they are but men john lived in 
london for he lived with his uncle we say that the truth 
of the proposition in italic being in each instance admitted 
requires us to admit the proposition which precedes to be 
true but requires whom certainly not every one it 
requires the admission only from those who in each instance 
have certain further knowledge namely as regards the first 
instance this further knowledge that men are mortal and as 
regards the second instance this further knowledge that johns 
uncle lived in london the further knowledge supposed in 
the first instance is knowledge that every body is presumed to 
have and the argument will as widely be received as valid 
but the further knowledge supposed in the second instance 
may be in possession only of a few only to which few can it 
be offered as an argument but for them it is quite as valid 
as the argument in the other instance we see then that 
in the development of knowledge as in the induction there 
are three things present at every step or stage of progress 
and these three things in the deductive procedure may be 
named the datum commonly unexpressed but always pre 
sent in thought the argument and the conclusion when 
these are all expressed in the order here mentioned they form 
the syllogism of deductive logic as men are mortal 
kings are men therefore kings are mortal johns uncle 
lived in london john lived with his uncle therefore john 
lived in london 

 arguments have technical names derived from three 



 manual of logic chap iv 

sources i from the topics whence they are taken ii from 
the data to which they are addressed iii from the 
forms of development our practical distinctions must be 
continued by a statement in detail of the divisions and sub 
divisions under each of these heads 

practical distinctions continued i names of augu 
st i nts from the topics whence they are taken 

 external arguments experiment and testimony 
 if the argument or proof which we seek under a gene 
ral head or topic is not already a part of our knowledge 
such general head or topic will be either experiment or 
testimony and the argument will be derived externally 
it will not in this case belong to deductive logic but inductive 
that is to say it will be knowledge yet to be sought and made 
our own either by actual experience or by admitting the ex 
perience of others in place of actual experience now all our 
knowledge is originally suggested by external things and 
therefore differs not in its beginning from that belonging to 
the topics here proposed under the two names experiment 
and testimony but the reason for the distinction is this the 
arguments sought after under tin hads called interned are pre 
sumed to be included in the subjects which w undertake to 
develop because to understand tin tnn designating the 
subject is to have the knowledge which that understanding 
necessarily includes thus for instance to understand what 
is meant by a plant a mineral an animal is to know what is 
a plant what is a mineral what is an animal to understand 
what is meant by pride or by virtue is to know what con 
stitutes pride what constitutes virtue but the knowledge 
here supposed is ordinary knowledge not the recondite 
relations which the scientific experimentalist reaches nla 
tions which as to a plant a mineral an animal form the 
physical sciences botany geology zoology any treatise or 
development of which must be founded on proofs called expe 
rimental thus airain if knowledge is proposed to be 

 the data and topics of arguments are quite as necessary to be con 
sidered in rhetoric as in deductive logic and they are accordingly 
exhibited with appropriate differences of view in the manual of lihutoric 



sec deductive logic practice 

developed from the proper names john or socrates all we can 
presume the names to include is that there is or was a man 
called john or socrates if more than this is developed or 
sought to be developed it must be from the peculiar know 
ledge which the thinker enjoys the fruit of his peculiar ex 
perience or of the information he derives as a learned man 
from the stores of history the scientific knowledge thus 
induced under the term is not necessarily included in it till the 
induction takes place and even then the arguments are 
fitted to convince only those who have the knowledge and 
not the generality of persons who use and understand the 
terms no further than in their ordinary sense deductive 
logic is however the art of developing in words such know 
ledge as we have and therefore if the thinker has the know 
ledge here assigned to the two heads called external the 
knowledge is to him internal and the distinction a name 
without a difference though as a name it will be useful 
when we have to employ logic as a basis for rhetoric 

 hence mr john s mill denominates a proper name a nonconnota 
tive word connotative according to him is that which notes something 
and along with it something more or in addition thus the word man 
is connotative for while it notes any one man it notes his kind or all 
that constitutes him a man thus again the word white is connotative 
for while it notes the quality white in any one thing it notes or implies 
it in all other white things on the other hand john and whiteness are 
said to be nonconnotative and we may perhaps exemplify the reason 
given for this by saying that they are words incapable of being used in 
predication otherwise than specially we cannot say for instance this 
man is john by virtue of any general knowledge included in the word 
but only by virtue of our special accidental knowledge that such is his 
name neither can we say of anything except of whiteness itself that it 
is whiteness for the word whiteness is so grammatically conditioned as 
to be immediately applicable only to our knowledge of what whiteness is 
and not immediately to the white things from which that knowledge has 
been derived in thus explaining the distinction sought to be enforced by 
the term nonconnotative we wish it to be seen that it arises entirely out 
of the aristotelian doctrine of predication and its utility or inutility must

and afortiori 

 when having laid down some point or purpose of de 
velopment we go on to argue the truth of what we assert y 
appealing to the nature of our subject as it is or as it might 
be exhibited in a definition we are said to reason from defi 
miiox if for instance we desire to develop the knowledge 
contained in the proposition man is accountable for in 
actions the argument may be that he is a creature endowed 
with reason and liberty which is a definition of mans na 
ture this is an argument by virtue of the datum that 
ever creature endowed with reason and liberty is accountable 
for his actions and both being admitted as a part of our pre 
vious knowledge the conclusion is inevitable or if we desire 
to place the truth evidently before us in words that certain 
lines are equal to one another the argument may be that 
they are radii of the same circle this is an argument by 
virtue of the datum that the radii of the same circle are 
always equal and both being admitted as belonging to our 
previous knowledge the conclusion is again inevitable 

 when we develop our knowledge from the original 
sense of the word that stands for our knowledge we are said 
to reason from etymology if for instance we desire to 
develop the knowledge that the idle have no relaxation 
the argument may be that the word relaxation originally sig 
nifies the loosening of what is tight borrowing from 
another topic hereafter mentioned namely analogy or parity 
of case we add to the argument from etymology the further 
argument that as the idle never apply or draw their facul 
ties tight so they can never be said to relax their faculties 
the former is an argument by virtue of the datum that the 
idle do not loosen what is tight and the latter an argument 
by virtue of the datum that not to draw the faculties tight 
and not to apply them are expressions that mean the same 
thing all this being admitted as a part of previous know 
ledge the conclusion is inevitable 



sec deductive logic practice 

 when we develop the knowledge we entertain under 
a general term or a general proposition by detailing the par 
ticulars which constitute our knowledge we are said to reason 
from enumeration thus for instance we develop our 
knowledge of what a dozen means or a score by counting 
up to a dozen or a score inclusively this is an argument 
by virtue of the datum that the number so counted is a dozen 
or a score and the conclusion follows inevitably thus 
again if we wish to develop the knowledge contained in the 
proposition a fine art always addresses as its appropriate 
object our imaginative sensibility through the sense of 
hearing or of sight our first argument may be an enumera 
tion of the fine arts namely poetry music painting sculp 
ture accompanied in each instance by the more special 
proposition that poetry addresses as its appropriate object 
our imaginative sensibility through the sense of hearing 
music addresses c through the sense of hearing painting 
addresses c through the sense of sight sculpture ad 
dresses c through the sense of sight this enumeration is 
an argument by virtue of the datum that poetry music 
painting sculpture are all the fine arts and both being 
admitted as a part of our previous knowledge the conclusion 
is inevitable thus again if we wish to develop our know 
ledge that a heavy body lifted from the earth has always 
fallen to the earth again when the sustaining power was 
removed our argument may be the enumeration of a b c 
d c which in our own experience or that of others has 
in each instance fallen to the earth under the circumstances 
stated this again is an argument by virtue of the datum 
that a b c d c are all the things or represent all the 
things on which the experiment has been tried and both 
being admitted as a part of our previous knowledge again the 
conclusion is inevitable 

the argument from enumeration is sometimes confounded 
with the argument from induction but induction as we have 
seen is not an internal argument and the conclusion it sug 
gests is not included in the premises and therefore is not a 
necessary conclusion but an inference although we do not the 
less receive it as true thus for instance having to ascer 
tain whether it is a truth or general law that every heavy 
tody being lifted from the earth will fall again to it if every 

d 



l manual of logic climp iv 

in ti veiling thing be removed we have recourse to experiment 
an tin cxjhriiiknt answering our expectation we then jijr 
that as a b c d c liave fallen again to the earth after 
having been lifted from it so all bodies whatever will fall to 
earth under the same circumstances in other words that this 
is a general property of bodies near the earths surface now 
the inference here is not included in the premises the neces 
sary conclusion from which is that a has fallen that b has 
fallen c not that z y x c will fall and this sort 
of conclusion is called the inference of physics 

yet the difference between the argument from enumeration 
and induction is done away with by conceding the know 
ledge a knowledge which all people must acquire that 

 but why must they acquire it the philosophers of the 
school here come in with what they call a fundamental principle of belief 
i am glad to avail myself of the objections to that dogma which one of 
their number mr james douglas of cavers thus urges that hvid 
stewart and turgot have been mistaken in proposing such an original 
law of thought as a belief in the continuance of the laws of nature will 
easily appear that can never be an original proposition which consists 
of slowly acquired terms had we an innate idea of nature of laws or 
of permanence then we might have such an ultimate and instinctive prin 
ciple but since the notion of nature is very gradually acquired and since 
the term laws is metaphorical the absurdity of our forming a conclusion 
while we are yet unfurnished with t will be abundantly appa 

rent should it be said that this law of thought remains dormant till we 
become acquainted with the meaning t nature and of laws though this 
supposition is sufficiently absurd in itself it may be further observed that 
our belief of this permanence of the laws of nature is certain and uniform 
but no certain conclusion can be attached to variable terms such as the 
very complex and fluctuating notions of nature and her laws unless we 
had within us a model of what nature is and what her laws are and also 
whether continuance is to be understood in an absolute or in a qualified 
it would be impossible to arrive with any certainty at the conclu 
im which is thus made the foundation of our belief and of reasoning 
the truth is here is a confusion between acquiescence and belief to 
acquiesce in the regularity of nature is one of our earliest habits but to 
believe in the permanence of the laws of nature is one of the ript 
of the understanding the process from childhood does not seem to be 
well understood the child receives all things according to the philosophic 
expression of wordsworth in a wise passiveness it has no doubts 
and therefore can have no belief the permanence of the laws of nature 
mould the thoughts of the child to their own continual recurrence what 
is still more the structure of his own frame corresponds and fits in with 
the laws of external nature not only are all his thoughts moulded for 
example to the succession of day and night but the structure both of his 



sec deductive logic practice 

where an experiment never has failed it never will fail the 
datum will then be as a b c d c have fallen to the 
earth after being lifted from it so z y x c will fall 
under the same circumstance the argument will be as before 
that a b c d c have fallen from which argument the 
conclusion by virtue of the datum that z y x c will 
fall now follows as necessary and inevitable because the 
premises now include it 

 when we develop our knowledge by going back to 
knowledge that includes it instead of using an argument that 
comes immediately under the knowledge we purpose to de 
velop we are said to reason from the genus thus if in 
order to develop our knowledge that man will be punished 
or rewarded for which our special argument might be that 
he is accountable for his actions we choose to use the more 
general argument every creature endowed with reason and 
liberty is accountable for his actions we shall properly be 
said to reason from the genus since every creature endowed 
with reason and liberty includes the species man so again 
if we wish to develop our knowledge that a devotion to 
poetry quickens the imaginative sensibility we may take our 
argument from the general definition of the fine arts instead of 
the definition of poetry in particular and the argument will 
then be from the genus instead of the species although it will 
also be taken from the definition or nature of the fine arts 



body and mind fit him for the alternate change of light and darkness of 
activity and repose the moment that any doubt should occur to him 
which can only be after his reason is exercised and his thoughts have 
taken a free range that moment they would be repelled by a principle 
already familiar to him not indeed in words but implied in our earliest 
reasonings the principle to which leibnitz has given the name of sufficient 
reason this is not an original principle itself but is merely the logical 
form of that original principle which we have already pointed out that 
every change refers to a cause where no adequate cause has operated 
no change can have taken place the course of nature must continue till 
the power which gave it that course changes its direction there can 
therefore be no reasonable doubt as to the permanence of the laws of 
nature except in those cases where the interposition of god can be reason 
ably expected thus then we need not multiply original principles 
without necessity but may rest our belief in the continuance of the laws 
of nature upon that fundamental belief that every event has a cause 
the philosophy of the mind by james douglas esq of cavers 
page et seq 



 manual of logic chap iv 

an argument from the species would of course be from the 
definition of poetry in particular but such argument would 
be more eligibly assigned to the topic definition leaving to 
the topic species only what is otherwise called exampk or 
instance thus if we sought to develop our knowledge that 
industry is the source of all the blessings of life we might 
give as an instance of one of these blessings the improvement 
of the mind by study which is an argument by virtue of 
the implied datum that this is but one of similar instances 
which instances if completed would form the argument 
call id enumeration and that this instance may be rationally 
accepted in place of all 

 when we develop our knowledge by so much of the 
nature or definition of the thing known as accounts for certain 
effects we are said to reason from the cause thus in 
order to develop our knowledge that pride is odious we may 
use for our argument the proposition that it offends the self 
love of others this is an argument by virtue of the datum 
that every thing which offends the selflove of others is 
odious again if we wish to develop our knowledge that 
wine largely and frequently drunk is a poison we may use 
for our argument that it tends to dcstmv the constitution 
which is an argument by virtue of the datum that every thing 
which tends to destroy the constitution is a poison but 
note that in deductive logic nothing can be called a cause 
lrn h is not already admitted to be one the discovery of 
natural causes is the business of the physical sciences and 
tin conclusion belonging to them is inference a conclusion 
which is never included in the premises and is therefore 
never a necessary conclusion it is always a conclusion which 
may be set aside by subsequent experiment thus for in 
stance we may conclude from the fact that a man has died 
after having eaten of a certain herb that it is a poison this 
is an inference but if subsequently we find that thousands 
of people have eaten of the same herb with no ill effect we 
are obliged to renounce that inference and infer that the herb 
is not a poison in neither case is the inference a conclusion 
belonging to deductive logic but an inference of physics and 
assignable to inductive learning the examples given above 
are examples of what is called efficient cause from this we 
have to distinguish what is called final cause a final cause 



sec deductive logic practice 

is in other words the motive end or purpose on account of 
which something has existence thus when a man dies by 
poison and by his own act these are the efficient causes of his 
death the final cause may be to escape from the tortures of 
the rack or the agonies of insanity or despair 

 when we develop our knowledge by so much of the 
nature or definition of the tiling known as may make its 
nature evident in what it produces we are said to reason from 
the effect or effects thus in order to develop our know 
ledge that pride is odious we may use for our argument the 
proposition that all persons shun the society of the proud 
this is an argument by virtue of the datum that a quality must 
be odious which makes all persons shun any one who has it 
thus again we may develop our knowledge of a diseased 
constitution in a person who drinks wine largely and fre 
quently by affirming that the disease is the effect of such 
practice which is an argument by virtue of the datum that 
the disease uniformly follows the practice and that whenever 
there is this uniformity of sequence that which precedes is the 
cause and that which follows is the effect but note that 
in deductive logic nothing can be called an effect which is not 
already admitted to be an effect with reference to a correlative 
cause the discovery of natural effects is the business of the 
physical sciences and the conclusion belonging to them is 
inference if for instance in any particular case there is 
room to suspect that disease in a man who drinks largely and 
frequently of wine is not the effect of that practice the sus 
picion must be admitted so far as to warrant the search after 
the proper correlative cause but the certainty or uncertainty 
of the inference resulting from such search has nothing to do 
with the certainty of the deductive conclusion for this being 
contained in its premises is always a necessary conclusion 
yet it is to be remembered that the premises will be faulty 
if they state as a certainty what the inductive inference only 
makes probable 

 the phrases apriori and aposteriori often 
occur as terms belonging to logic implying the same things 
as argument from cause and argument from effect but 
their use instead of these terms requires explanation among 
the ancients there prevailed an opinion that all knowledge 
flowed from certain original truths implanted in the mind 



g manual of logic chap iv 

and that every special truth was but a deduction from these 
original truths but if as modem philosophy teaches all 
the knowledge we can reach is the result of experience while 
we admit that the faculties of our race are such as to be 
affected by the same experience in the same way it follows 
notwithstanding this admission that taking the expression 
absolutely there is no such thing as apriori knowledge but 
taking the expression relatively that is assuming certain 
knowledge to be inevitable where there is the capacity for it 
and also the ordinary occasions of suggestion or of learning 
then all reasoning which is deductive will be apriori reason 
ing and all inductive reasoning will be aposteriori or from 
facts that is from new facts we may hence define apriori 
reasoning to be that which proceeds from truths already 
known and merely deduces the special truths included in 
them while aposteriori reasoning is that which infers general 
truths from particular truths which particular truths do not 
necessarily constitute them but are admitted to be quite suffi 
cient to establish them as science from which we are entitled 
to reason deductively that is on the apriori principle 
thus we conclude apriori or beforehand that a man will 
die as the effect of having drunk a mortal poison without an 
antidote thus again we conclude apriori that pride will 
render a person odious to all who are made to feel its effects 
and thus again we conclude aprwri that lines which we 
propose to make radii of the same circle will be equal to one 
another but in every instance and it is the same in all 
instances the apriori knowledge has been obtained aposte 
riori thus we know that the man will die because previous 
effects had led us to infer the drug as a cause thus we know 
that pride will make a person odious because we have 
inferred that sentiment as the cause in a variety of observed 
effects and thus we know that lines which are radii of the 
same circle are equal to one another because experience has 
made us aware that in knowing what a circle is the equality 
of its radii is included in our knowledge 

 this point is in discussion the old philosophers would have in 
sisted that the knowledge of the properties of a circle is original know 
ledge in man dr whewell following the german transcendental ists

 the word cause means a permanent antecedent or 
what we have found by experience to have a certain conse 
quent or certain consequents and which we hence call an 
effect or effects but there are antecedents on which we 
cannot yet rely so as to call them with certainty the causes 
of the consequents and when we use such antecedents as 
arguments in order to infer the consequents we are said to 
reason from the antecedents thus when a man has died 
after taking a certain drug which was not previously known 
to be poisonous but which we now call so we may be said 
to reason from the antecedent this however is an induc 
tive argument and not deductive in making it deductive 
we assume a datum which logically necessitates its conclusion 
without diminishing the doubt accompanying the inference 
as when after taking a drug a person soon dies it is very 
probable that the drug has killed him this person took c 
and soon after died therefore it is very probable that his death 
was caused by the drug 

 the word effect means a permanent consequent or 
what we have found by experience always follow an ante 
cedent but there are consequents on which we cannot yet 
rely so as to call them with certainty effects and when we 
use such consequents as arguments in the development of our 
knowledge in order to infer the antecedents we are said to 
reason from the consequents thus when a man has died 
and exhibits certain marks usual in people who have swal 
lowed poison we infer that he died through poison but 
this is an inductive argument the marks may proceed from

gism we must take care to assume in the datum no greater 
certainty of knowledge than we have reached in the inductive 
process 

 when we develop our knowledge by entering on 
details which are not necessarily or as the ancient logicians 
consider essentially included in the name of the thing known 
we are said to reason from the adjuncts or accidents of our 
subject thus we may develop our knowledge of john by 
all that constitutes the history of john the name john 
itself is nothing more tlian the proper name of one of our 
species and it does not necessarily or essentially include more 
knowledge than that john is a male of our species all 
beyond this we may call the adjuncts or accidents of john 
these adjuncts or accidents are nevertheless essential to the 
individuality of john when they have occurred and all we 
can truly say of them is that they do not belong to the indi 
viduality of any other person 

essence in the doctrine of the ancient logicians is that 
which makes a thing what it is thus rationality is the 
essence of man and yet an idiot is not rational though we 
still count him a man an accident is that which belongs to 
some individual thing of the kind but not to others if we 
are praising the pleasures of a country life generally we may 
dwell on the sublimities of mountain scenery or on the sweet 
uly groves but every country has not mountains 
and shady groves are pleasant only where the sun is scorch 
ing am oppressive these therefore are adjuncts or acci 
dents and are nonessentials some accidents have been 
calkd properties it is for instance the property of man to 
become gray but this is a property belonging to man in old 
age and not always even then again it is a property of 
man to be capable of laughing it may be doubted whether 
this is a property or essential to the nature of man but the 
discussion involves a point of no moment provided we un 
derstand the meaning of the words as they have been and as 
they are still liable to be used the theory of logic on a true 
foundation requires no other statement than this that what 
ever we already know is necessarily included in the develop 
ment of our knowledge and that what we do not yet know 

 compare chapter iii section page 



sec deductive logic practice 

must be reached by observation and experiment the conclu 
sions from which are not necessary or included in the facts 
observed but are properly called inferences 

 in developing our knowledge we are often said to 
take our arguments from comparison now all knowledge 
consists in being aware of relations and to take an argument 
from comparison is therefore to take it from the store of all 
arguments but a subject already known may be better un 
derstood by seeking and using comparisons that are not a part 
of our knowledge at the moment of seeking them thus we 
can feel or understand more vividly the previously known 
fact that novels of a certain kind are injurious by comparing 
them to poison the things known are not of the same 
nature and the effects are in the one case moral in the other 
physical still there is the relation of similitude which renders 
the knowledge of the mischief done by novels more vivid 
this topic namely similitude is the source of all metaphor 
in language as may be exemplified by the previous instance 
which appears no more than an ordinary metaphor when we 
say some novels poison the mind although if expressed 
at full there would be the same things which every act of 
knowledge includes namely the thing known the thing by 
which it is known or better known and the knowledge 
itself thus again if we wish to understand more clearly 
the already acknowledged truth that the indolent cannot 
obtain the favour of heaven we may compare indolent 
people with idle servants and heaven with the master this 
as the things compared are deemed to be of the same kind or 
nature cannot so well be called an argument from similitude 
but is more appropriately described as an argument from 
analogy or parity of case further in reasoning from the 
comparison of things agreeing in kind we may take those 
that are known to be directly opposite in their qualities and 
effects thus in order to increase the vividness of our con 
viction that vice is the source of disquiet that it leads to 
infamy here and punishment hereafter we may place these 
truths already admitted by the side of the opposite truths 
and say that as virtue promotes peace attracts honour and 
reputation and paves a road to eternal bliss so vice c 
which is called an argument from contraries still further 
it is possible in comparing things of the same kind to take 



 manual of logic chap iv 

neither those that have exactly parallel or analogous effects 
nor those that have opposite effects but things that hav tin 
same effects so far as they approach perfect identity thus 
if we desire to illustrate the admitted truth that the wicked 
are always more or less miserable we may place it by the 
side of another admitted truth that the entirely wicked are 
entirely miserable and other wicked people less so only in 
proportion as they are less wicked and this may be called 
an argument from proportion and fifthly there is a special 
way of arguing from comparison when in order to illustrate an 
admitted truth we place it by the side of one of the same 
kind which though acknowledged as a truth makes its way 
to the understanding with more difficulty thus to under 
stand with greater force the truth that a man ought to be 
forgiving to his friends we may place it by the side of 
another truth which is admitted though less liable to be so 
and say that a man ought to forgive even his enemies 
much more then ought he c and this is called the argu 
ment afortiori or from a bolder assertion in proof of one 
less bold that is less difficult of admission 

 it is chiefly in these special ways of reasoning from 
comparison that the phrases ceteris paribus and mutatis 
mutandis occur the meaning of the former is other things 
being equal of the latter those things being changed which the 
difference in the persons or things compared may require to be 
changed thus we may have occasion to say this mea 
sure was successful then and coeteris paribus will succeed 
now this course and method of study will benefit boys 
and mutatis mutandis may be adopted for girls 

practical distinctions continued ii names of argu 
ments from the data on which they rest 

 in every act of the reasoning power there are three 
things the thing known that by which it is known and 
the knowledge itself abstracted from the things that suggested 
it in the deductive process of logic the former two things 
are likewise abstract knowledge and we may call the one the 
datum the other the argument or reason it is sometimes 
quite immaterial to which we apply the one or the other of 
these two names for instance when we say three feet are 



sec deductive logic practice 

one yard thirtysix inches are three feet therefore thirtysix 
inches are one yard here we may indifferently call the first 
or the second proposition the datum or the argument out of 
which the third proposition arises as the conclusion the two 
former propositions are called the premises for the most 
part however the premises out of which a conclusion arises 
will in the deductive process consist first of a general pro 
position which includes many particulars and secondly of 
one of those included particulars the term datum will then 
be properly applied to the general proposition and the term 
argument to the one included in it and the argument may 
under such circumstances take its name from the nature of 
the knowledge which is presupposed or assumed in putting it 
forth as an argument it is to be observed that the doctrine 
here held seems to belong only to the process of reasoning 
with other minds and therefore to rhetoric and not to logic 
yet even in thinking within oneself a person may proceed 
from knowledge more or less deeply founded and the dis 
tinctions laid down under the head which is placed above are 
on this account claimed for logic although they will be 
properly repeated when we have to consider the practice of 
rhetoric 

 when we develop our knowledge by an argument 
which is included in such general knowledge as all mankind 
possess the argument is said to be argumentum ad 
judicium that is an argument to ordinary judgement 
an argument which all people of common sense and ordinary 
information must admit as well as oneself and this is the 
ground of almost every argument to which every particular 
ground every one for instance which is described and 
exemplified in the six following sections 
 is an exception 

 when a person develops knowledge in which others 
have no share the arguments are fitted to convince himself 
alone for instance if i know and no one else knows that 
 john lived with his uncle the fact which may be known 
to many people that johns uncle always lived in london 
is an argument with me that john lived in london but 
can be no argument with those who have no share with me 
in the knowledge implied by the first proposition an argu 
ment thus peculiarly founded is the type of that kind which 



 manual of logic chap iv 

in rhetoric is called argumentum ad hominem that is an 
argument addressed to the knowledge the principles or per 
suasion entertained by the one man in particular whom they 
are intended to convince the difference being that which 
holds universally between logic and rhetoric namely that in 
the former the reasoning is confined to oneself and the pecu 
liar knowledge is ones own while in the latter the reasoning 
is applied to convince another and the peculiar knowledge or 
persuasion belongs to that other person 

 when the knowledge we develop is a particular de 
partment of learning or science the arguments are fitted to 
convince all who are instructed in that part of learning or 
science but not to convince people of common or ordinary 
information thus if i know the distance between myself 
and a certain column to be two hundred feet and that the 
angle formed by the lines reaching from my feet to the base 
and to the top of the column is an angle of fortyfive degrees 
i shall conclude that the column is two hundred feet high 
but this will be a conclusion only to my mind and to others 
instructed in the science on which the reasoning proceeds 
an argument thus founded is called aitt mkmum ad doo 
trinam that is an argument addressed to or derived from 
some particular part of learning 

 when we develop knowledge which rests for its truth 
on the reverence entertained for its source each included 
argument takes the name argumentum ad verecundiam 
that is an argument derived from or addressed to the stnti 
ment of reverence or respect thus for instance if i believe 
all to be true which a certain respected friend solemnly avers 
i shall believe every particular to be true which makes a part 
of the whole and the conclusion will be that since the 
whole is true the particular is true 

 when we develop knowledge which rests for its truth 
on the religious faith we embrace each included argument 
takes the name argumentum ad fidem that is an argument 
di rived from or addressed to the religious faith of the person 
or persons embracing such faith thus with regard to 
persons who admit the bible to be the inspired word of god 
every particular included in the bible is admitted to be a 
part of that revelation and consequently admitted to be 
true 



sec deductive logic practice 

 in rhetoric it is possible to address inferior motives of 
action and to keep back in order to gain some temporary 
end the truth as it exists in the mind of the artful reasoner 
in logic it is not possible so to deceive oneself but there 
are ways nevertheless by which even in ones own thoughts 
one may wilfully go astray a person may choose for in 
stance to remain in a state of ignorance on a certain subject 
when the ways to inform himself are open whatever con 
clusion he may reach while in this state will be a conclusion 
derived from ignorance and the process with such differ 
ence as the difference between logic and rhetoric creates 
will correspond to what in the latter is called argumentum 
ad ignorantiam such for example will be the process 
with a thinker who having imbibed the opinion that all 
people that belong to a sect in religion different from his own 
are bad people concludes that a b one of these people is 
a bad man which may or may not be true in point of fact 
but is not made true by an argument thus derived 

 again it is not only possible but is the great error of 
our lives to be led away from truth in our own thoughts by 
the allurement or the violence of our passions in every case 
of tins kind there are two sets of data the one set abstract 
or free from our passions the other set derived from or 
suggested by them thus tor instance the murderer knows 
that the act he is about to commit is a crime but there is 
some good suggested by his passions which in the blindness 
they create at the moment seems to outweigh the good he 
leaves behind and the conclusion which he reaches urges 
him to the deed such a case corresponds to the process 
which in rhetoric is called argumentum ad passiones

ments from the form in which the reasoning is

while the reasoning process which gives occasion to the par

precisely the same every single word is the fit expression

steps after the knowledge indicated by it has been attained

hended three things the thing known the tiling by which 
it was known and the knowledge itself abstracted from both 
thus the word man cannot express the knowledge we have 
under that word unless there is first apprehended a creature 
distinct from other creatures as for instance a creature like 
oneself yet not oneself and in most respects unlike other 
creatures such or something like it is the knowledge we 
include under the name which knowledge involves the three 
things stated the thing known the thing or things by which 
it is known and the knowledge itself when afterwards 
our knowledge under the same word becomes mature through 
the force of instruction or of observation and we understand 
man as a rational animal there are still the three things 
already referred to for we understand him to be rational 
because we understand other animals to be irrational and our 
knowledge included under and abstracted by the word is 
the result we may if we like develop the knowledge 
which this word thus includes in such a form as the fol 
lowing every creature on earth that is not irrational is 
man the creature now under notice or knowledge is not 
irrational therefore the creature now under notice is man 
these three propositions the moment they are recognised in 
their connection with each other are one expression with 
one meaning and the word man includes the whole of 
that meaning but the word man is in form a grammatical 
nounsubstantive the three propositions are in form what 
in logic is called a syllogism now in this way may every 
result of the understanding if not already expressed in the 
form of a syllogism be expanded or reduced into that form 
and this form since it represents the three things included in 
every act of the intellect is commonly assumed to be the funda 
mental form to which every other form is referrible when 
we desire to examine its soundness 

 but the syllogism is a fundamental form only because 
it represents in three distinct propositions every natural act 
of the understanding it has no other merit its claim to 
be demonstrative that is to exhibit a necessary conclusion 
rests on the fact that the first two propositions which are 
called the premises contain the conclusion if the premises 



sec deductive logic practice 

are denied we must go back to another syllogism and 
perhaps to another and if we thus fairly go back to the 
beginning of our knowledge that beginning will always be 
an induction that is knowledge growing out of two things 
which do not include the knowledge but spring from the 
natural capacity of the intellect operated upon by the things 
of sense a phrase constructed of two words may represent 
the syllogism as thus described namely the syllogism whose 
premises contain the conclusion as well as the syllogism 
whose premises infer it for example the phrase reasoning 
man exhibits premises containing the conclusion which the 
phrase expresses for he who knows what the word reasoning 
means must know that it includes man again he who 
knows what the word man means must know that it in 
cludes the power of reasoning which is essential in man 
the whole phrase then which is one expression with one 
meaning exhibits a necessary conclusion out of the premises 
indicated by the words which form the phrase this is an 
example of a phrase representing the syllogism whose pre 
mises contain the conclusion let us take another example 
mortal man he whose experience goes so far as to assure 
him that man is mortal universally that is including men 
that live and men that will live will find this phrase corre 
spondent with the other but if the premises should be 
doubted that is if it should be doubted whether the know 
ledge we have under the term mortal can be applied thus 
universally to man or whether the word man includes thus 
universally of man what we mean by mortal then we have 
to await further facts in order to confirm or set aside what 
the phrase expresses suppose the facts at length suggest 
the result such result will be an inference not a necessary 
conclusion till at length the previous knowledge being 
granted the conclusion is necessarily granted with it now 
every syllogism drawn out in form if we deny or question 
its premises will lead us thus back to the same state of 
things namely a state in which the conclusion will not be a 
necessary consequence but an inference hence then as 
there is no virtual difference between a syllogism and any 
expression constructed of two words that make sense we 
may take the latter namely two words that make sense as 
the original because the simpler form of expression which 
logic employs in the deductive process and refer all other 



 manual of logic chap iv 

forms including the syllogism itself to that simpler form of 
expression two words that make sense may not however 
form a sentence or proposition they may form only a part 
of a sentence that is a part of speech this indeed 
no moment to logic if we look only to logic independently 
of grammar but logic though distinct in theory from 
grammar is in practice indissolubly connected with it and 
hence a complete expression of logical deduction must be at 
least a sentence now the shortest sentence that can be 
constructed is that which consists of nominative and verb 
and this as being the shortest and simplest form of expres 
sion may be regarded as the original form in which know 
ledge is developed in deductive logic as man reas 
 man dies john lives fairies frolic 

 but the noun and the verb which are the only essen 
tial parts in the logical development of knowledge ma 
be a constructed part that is may be a part indicative of 
further logical development instead of saying reasons 
see above we may say is a reasoning creature and 
the whole proposition will then be man is a reasoning 
creature the other propositions may be developed in a 
similar manner whether develnpid in this way or not the 
process of the understanding will be the same the result 
must always be expressed by instrumental signs which being 
joined form one expression with one meaning thus for 
instamv the following sentence when all its parts are put 
together is one expression for one meaning man nome in 
reason infinite in faculties in form and moving express and 
admirable in action like an angel in apprehension like a god 
is a wonderful piece of work the development of its one 
meaning is primarily into two parts which two parts may 
be called nominative and verb these two parts are sub 
ordinal ly divisible till we reach the grammatical single 
parts of speech which form the larger grammatical part in 
rhetoric it might be advisable to reach the result by sevral 
distinct sentences and each sentence in rhetoric might 
advisedly take the form of exclamation but these expe 



 for instance as it stands in shakspeare what a piece of work is 
man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and 
moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in 
apprehension how like a god 



sec deductive logic peactice 

dients are forms for influencing other minds not forms which 
the thinking mind requires for the development of knowledge 
in order to satisfy itself this doctrine being admitted we 
conclude that the sentence consisting of nominative and verb 
however these two parts are subordinately divisible is the 
original or primary form in the logical development of know 
ledge 

 still as the custom of logic from time immemorial 
has been to refer all forms of speech to that of the syllogism 
and as this agrees essentially with the doctrine unfolded in 
the previous remarks there is no necessity to oppose such 
reference the following names and distinctions which 
assume the syllogism for their foundation may therefore be 
acquiesced in 

 an enthymeme is a form of language which includes 
the three propositions of a syllogism while it expresses only 
two of them thus if we say brutes are not rational 
agents and therefore are not accountable we imply but 
do not express the datum none but rational agents are 
accountable again when we say john lived in london 
for he lived with his uncle the reason given in the second 
proposition for what is stated in the first includes the datum 
that his uncle lived in london since without that datum it 
would be no reason at all 

 a sorites is a form of language which includes two 
or more syllogisms while it so expresses the reasoning that 
each proposition is the ground of the following one till we 
reach that in which we design to rest in other words it is 
the accumulation of one argument upon another as man 
is a creature endowed with reason and liberty every creature 
so endowed is accountable for his actions an accountable 
creature will be punished for his evil and rewarded for his 
good deeds therefore man will be punished or rewarded 

 a logic which builds its principles on the arbitrary 

 the reader has to be admonished that in all these remarks we are 
contending against the formal logic of aristotle of which the pervading 
characteristic is to attribute to the changing forms of language essential 
differences of mental act against such doctrine a more explicit oppo 
sition is offered in the sixth chapter of this work to which chapter the 
reader is referred for a better understanding of the purpose of the several 
remarks now in progress 



 manual of logic chap iv 

forms of language so that the parts of speech whether 
simple or compounded are made to act differently and dis 
tinctly in the process of coming to a conclusion from pre 
mises is an art quite apart from the logic treated of in these 
pages the former is the art of reasoning with words so as 
to keep the things signified as much as possible absent from 
the understanding the latter is the art of reasoning by means 
of words so used as to keep the things signified ever present 
to the understanding in order that our conclusions may be 
not from the words but from the things they signify now 
with regard to this logic which is the logic existing in the 
common daily use of language the grammatical character of 
a word or the peculiar form of a phrase or sentence is un 
essential to the validity of its acts it is for instance of no 
moment in our logic whether we say man or reasoning 
man or man reasons or man is a reasoning creature the 
thing meant being in each the same and the whole of the 
words in the last example forming one expression for the one 
meaning expressed by the first true it is that we are called 
upon by the form of the first and of the second expression to 
esteem the expression only an instrument of meaning to be de 
veloped and not as meaning yet developed while with regard 
to the last two examples we are at liberty either to rest in 
the development so far made or expect it to proceed further 
and in this way logic accepts the ministry of grammar 
but the differences are unessential in logic and belong pro 
perly to the other department of learning in our logic 
again it is of no moment whether we say every man is 
liable to error or no man is free from the liability to error 
since each proposition as one expression for one meaning 
stands for the same meaning and since each resolves pri 
marily into two parts namely the former proposition into 
every man and is liable to error the latter into no man 
and is free from the liability to error out of which two parts 
in the respective instances the same one meaning springs 
when therefore the former is called an affirmative and the 
latter a negative proposition we leave the distinction to 
grammar and consider that logic is in no way concerned 
with it though in rhetoric there will generally be a ground 
of preference for the one or the other in our logic once 
more it is of no moment whether we say kings like other 



sec deductive logic practice 

men are mortal or if kings are men they are mortal whether 
we say if the world is a sphere we must be able to reach the 
same point by moving from it in any one direction or the world 
being a sphere we must be able c we may admit the one 
form in each of these instances to be called a categorical pro 
position and the other a hypothetical or conditional one we 
may also admit on rhetorical grounds sometimes the one 
sometimes the other to be preferable but we do not admit 
that logic in its own strict province has any concern with 
such differences either in propositions or in the syllogisms 
which may be developed from them 

 there is however one description of syllogism whose 
difference from others our logic acknowledges because it is 
not a mere difference in form of expression but a peculiarity 
in the character of the knowledge developed the syllogism 
referred to is called the dilemma a form of expression 
never justly possible but when the knowledge to be developed 
includes something true and something not true while it 
does not include which is which for instance the knowledge 
or datum that the blessed in heaven will be fully content either 
because they will have no desires or because their desires will be 
completely gratified the knowledge or datum that eschines 
joined in the public rejoicings in which case he is inconsistent or 
did not join in them in which case he is unpatriotic the know 
ledge or datum that a certain man spoke irreverently of 
scripture in jest in which case he is not wise or in earmst in 
which case he is not good these unfolded into syllogisms 
will be examples of the dilemma as 

 if the blessed in heaven have no desires they will be 
fully content so they will if their desires are completely 
gratified but either they will have no desires or have 
them completely gratified therefore they will be fully 
content 

 if schines joined in the public rejoicings he is incon 
sistent if he did not he is unpatriotic but he either joined 
or not therefore he is either inconsistent or unpatriotic 

 if this man were wise he would not speak irreverently 
of scripture in jest and if he were good he would not do so 
in earnest but he does it either in jest or in earnest 
therefore he is either not wise or not good 

the manner of reasoning called eeductio ad absurdum 
bringing to an absurdity may be mentioned with the 



 ma nual of logic chap iv 

dilemma as requiring like it a double supposition the 
diilerence being that it completely establishes one of them 
as this road to our house is either straight or crooked 
i affirm it to be straight but i have no direct proof say 
then that it is crooked but it is of the same length and 
extends between an equal distance with one which we know 
to be straight thus we have two lines of the same length 
and extending between an equal distance the one by ad 
mission straight the other by supposition crooked which 
supposition is absurd therefore the line or road in ques 
tion is not crooked that is it is straight 

 an epichirema is a syllogism with arguments or 
proofs appended to one or both of the premises let the 
following syllogism be the foundation of an epichirema 

datum an event that has always followed an act 
will continue to follow it when circum 
stances are the same 
argument death has always quickly followed the 

drinking of this juice 

conclusion therefore the circumstances continuing the 
same death will in this instance juicklv 
follow the act of having drunk of this juice 
the following further development will give to this syl 
logism the name epichirema 

datum u an event that has ahvavs followed an act 
will continue to follow it when circum 
stances are the same this is not a ne 
cessary truth but the persuasion of ha 
bitual experience and we acknowledge its 
certainty by calculating without hesitation 
or doubt on issues that have often been tried 
argument now the drinking of this juice has ah 

been quickly followed by death as i can 
alhrm from instances that have come under 
my own observation from many more 
that have been reported to me by friends 
and from innumerable others which past 
recorded experience bears witness to 
conclusion therefore unless something can instantly 
be done to change the circumstances in the 
present case death will quickly follow the 
act that has been committed 



sec deductive logic practice 

in this laborious way does logic if left entirely to its own 
mode develop knowledge logic which is without passion 
without impulse to action rhetoric would be much 
more brief notwithstanding her repetitions hell die 
hell die he has drunk poison oh for an antidote 
virtually we here have the whole of the previous argument 
with emotion and urgency to action superadded 

practical directions continued exercises suggested 
for improvement in logic 

 there can be no proper practice of logic which is 
different in principle from that which directs the ordinary 
use of language in the previous pages we have been em 
ployed in ascertaining what that principle is and now that 
we know it we have to act upon it as before but with the 
caution which theoretical knowledge confers it is true that 
the ordinary use of language aims at rhetorical effect as well 
as logical precision in other words it is meant to influence 
others as well as to develop the knowledge in the reasoners 
mind but in practice it is not wise nor would it be easy 
to separate logic from rhetoric by any very rigid line for 
logic is the proper ground of rhetoric and the practice of 
rhetoric includes or ought to include logic in following 
such exercises as are hereafter suggested the learner is there 
fore only cautioned against any style which dispenses with a 
patient and laborious employment of thought but provided 
he fulfils his duty in the clear development of his own know 
ledge he needs not be the less satisfied if his language has a 
correspondent effect upon other understandings 

 improvement in logic is best promoted by the 
writing of what are called themes the word theme pro 
perly means the subject of a discourse but the discourse 
itself if merely an exercise is also called a theme we 
begin with a title which title may be a single grammatical 
noun or a logical noun or a proposition t 

 the title or subject of a theme being a mere gram 
matical noun will be the name of a thing real or ideal or 
metaphysical f while the name itself will be proper common

these being left for the learner to develop one or more 
or all another subject of the same class is added with 
a development appended by way of example 

 on observation 

observation is the practice of using the natural 
powers of sense and understanding so as to reach and 
retain all the knowledge we can with regard to this 
practice there are great differences among us some 
with powers naturally good and with extensive oppor 
tunities of gaining the wisdom that grows with expe 
rience seem to pass through life with their senses and 
understanding closed and leave the world almost as 
ignorant as they entered it they hear wise converse 
and read wise books but derive no practical advantage 
from either they see others fall into difficulties and 
dangers of which the causes and consequences are 
easily traceable but they neglect to trace them and 
learn nothing by which they may avoid the same 
mischiefs they travel through countries and see 
new manners and customs but they make no com 
parisons nor draw any useful conclusions in short 
their minds resemble a stagnant pool of water which 
if it collects anything covers itself only with weeds 
in the meantime there are others whose sphere of 
remark is very limited but who appear nevertheless 
to gain experience at every step and to grow in 
wisdom as they grow in years 

the difference which has been alluded to arises 
from nothing but the imperfect exertion of the natural 
powers in the one case and their proper and active 
use in the other a habit of inattention or a habit 
of quicksighted observation appears to be gained or 
lost much in the same way as habits of bodily indo 
lence or activity are gained or lost it is the deter 
mination of the will or the want of it that in either 
case produces the good habit or allows the evil one 
to form itself let us determine to keep the senses 
and the understanding closely applied at proper times 
to their appropriate objects and with perseverance 
the good habit will be gained and the evil one avoided

the following are other instances of subjects that are 
things metaphysical under names abstract 

on curiosity on hope on fear on anger on 
pride on humility on envy on emulation on 
piety on patriotism on generosity on selfishness 
on avarice on prodigality 

the generic name of these will be a principle in human 
nature or an impulse or a feeling or a sentiment or a 
passion the particular description from the effects pro 
duced will be the difference the definition thus made out 
the next point may be the benefit or the evil in some of 
tin subjects there will be both a benefit and an evil depend 
ing upon the proper and ill regulation of the principle the 
sentiment or passion instances from history or from ex 
perience may be added to verify the previous conclusions 
it must be observed further that some of the subjects as 
hope and fear pride and jluiiuutij are so obviously op 
posed in nature that the one cannot be considered without 
reference to the other of others though not opposed it 
must nevertheless be observed that the one cannot be ac 
curafflv dfatingcaahed without some allusion to the other 
for instance envy and emulation which are passions that 
spring from the same root namely a desire of superiority 
but differ by growing the one in a base narrow selfish mind 
the other in a generous one courage and fortitude are 
subjects that require also to be distinguished not on the 
same but on peculiar grounds as an example to guide the 
learner the latter of these subjects is developed under certain 
points hereunder 

 on fortitude 

fortitude and courage are not synonymous words 
though each quality in some degree implies the other 
fortitude is passive courage is active fortitude is 
tivngth to endure pain or other calamity courage 
is the absence of dismay in meeting and contending 
with that which threatens pain or death yet a 
courageous man can scarcely maintain his title if he 
has no fortitude a woman of fortitude can scarcely 
be so deemed if she has no courage 

we may distinguish these virtues by other marks 



sec deductive logic practice 

courage is much more frequently a constitutional 
quality than one derived from thought and moral 
principle the other may also be constitutional but 
it is much more frequently derived from the latter 
source or at least improved by aid from it men are 
more courageous than women because with them the 
bodily frame is stronger women are often found to 
have more fortitude than men partly from a difference 
of constitution but frequently because religious or 
moral feelings are purer and stronger in them than 
in the other sex 

but equally in woman and in man fortitude is a 
quality indispensable to the perfection of the human 
character we are born to pain or to calamity that 
produces or threatens pain without strength to 
endure the pain or calamity is more than doubled 
and a person who has no portion of such strength 
is not only more miserable than they who have it 
but is less respected and esteemed 

the question however remains whether fortitude 
depends upon discipline or is altogether a gift of 
nature we may safely answer that the best source 
of fortitude is religious and moral instruction it 
will aid natural strength where nature is already 
strong it will supply it where nature is weak he 
who in affliction feels that the hand which afflicts 
means the transient evil for future good will be able 
to bear the weight of that hand without repining 
like the virtuous job of old he will rise above his 
trials and like him will find sooner or later a 
reward for his endurance 

 we have seen that the arguments or means used 
in developing knowledge are internal or external in other 
terms subjective or objective when the name or title of a 
theme is immediately applicable to an external thing that is 
to a real or an ideal thing and not immediately to a thing 
metaphysical bearing an abstract name the difficulty of de

vclopment is increased because the tiring itself 

under a double aspect namely in its individual outward 
objective shape and as a subject that may be tract i from the 
stoivs which the mind has already appropriated stores 
which may be said to be already a part of tin mind itself 
let us say for instance that socrates the proper name of an 
individual person is proposed as a theme to treat this ob 
jectively would be to detail the facts belonging to the in 
dividual the place and time of his birth who were his 
parents what were the acts and events of his life what the 
time and manner of his death but we may omit these 
facts or take them for granted as known to all persons of 
education and confine our development to thoughts gene 
rated by these facts so that in truth the theme would more 
properly be entitled an estimate of the character of so 
or thoughts on the character c thus named and thus 
pursued the theme would class with those already exem 
plified namely a metaphysical subject under a name ab 
stract for the several words form one name with one 
meaning and that name taken as one is a name abstract 
we are at liltt howtr to develop our knowledge in 
both ways and all that in such case we have to remember 
is to keep the points clear and distinct both in thought and 
in expression and not to let the single name socrates be a 
hindrance to the fixing of proper points for consideration 
let us take for another instance the common name man 
as including knowledge proposed to be developed by a 
tlume how shall we proceed we art distracted at 
first by the apparently interminable considerations that spring 
indistinctly like blending rays from this centre to consider 
man objectively requires the thinker to be an anatomist a 
physiologist a tracer of the race in every variety which 
climate or original constitution has generated which is to 
t more than can be fulfilled by any one person for 
an ordinary theme if some objective points are taken they 
must be such as present themselves to every observer as 
for instance the human shape compared with that of other 
animals and the superior intelligence by which the strongest 
and most cunning of those animals are subdued but under 
the name man it is not uncommon to find that the knowledge 
developed is merely subjective which happens when man is 



sec deductive logic practice 

considered not in his physical but only in his moral relations 
the title in this case would strictly be on the moral relations 
of man and thus named the theme would class with those 
already exemplified let us take for a third instance the 
plural word ghosts a name of certain things ideal an ob 
jective development of knowledge under this title would be 
a description of the times the places and the appearances of 
ghosts either according to special reports or founded upon 
opinions that are or have been prevalent but retaining 
the title all objective reference to ghosts might be omitted 
and the theme pursued subjectively as if the title had been 
on the belief in ghosts when it would appear to be a theme 
classing with those already exemplified 

 it further appears from what precedes that the title of 
a theme may be a grammatical nounsubstantive as on 
ghosts on knowledge or a logical that is a constructed 
nounsubstantive as on the belief in ghosts on the know 
ledge of the world but a proposition a moral saying or a 
proverb may be placed as the title of an exercise as a 
proper knowledge of the world is favourable to virtue trust 
not appearances honesty is the best policy a theme thus 
given out is commonly called a thesis there is however 
no essential or necessary difference between a thesis and a 
theme f except the form of title for without requiring any 
change of what may have been developed under one form 
the title may at pleasure take the other form as on the 
moral advantages of a proper knowledge of the world on 
the danger of trusting to appearances on the policy of 
being honest the following exercise for instance which is 
called a thesis would be a theme by such change of title as 
is suggested above 

 trust not appearances 

it is highly imprudent to be guided in our opinions 
and conduct by first appearances for the worst of 

 popes poetical essay on man is an instance 

f the terms moreover are etymologically the same some teachers 
make a difference between both of these and an essay such distinctions 
being as they are distinctions without a difference are made either in 
ignorance or for the sake of practical differences which would be better 
indicated in some other way

persons and of things wear at times the most engaging 
aspect the wily thief approaches in the garb of 
pulous honesty the corrupter of hearts carries on his 
brow nothing but benevolence and candour vices of 
every kind assume the guise of virtues and pleasures 
that end in misery promise at first nothing but delight 
in things of less importance deception and fraud are 
equally common the unjust trader gives a false ap 
pearance to his wares and mere empirics in art or 
science make larger promises than they who are really 
skilful 

this description of what we meet with in the 
world is supported by further proofs it is because 
the arts of deception are spread in every direction 
that parents are careful to impress on their inexpe 
rienced children the necessity of caution it is on this 
account that all reflecting people consider the heedless 
the giddy the easilyconfiding to be in constant 
danger it is for this that as we grow in years we 
alter many if not most of our judgements and become 
more suspicious even when by an increase of our 
experience we are less in danger of being deceived 

the world may be called a garden abounding with 
noxious fruit among which much may be found that 
is wholesome but unfortunately the far greater part 
of the former is more enticing to the eye and on first 
taste far sweeter than the latter if the simile has 
any truth in it we are warned never to pluck and eat 
without the utmost caution 

poets as well as moralists bid us beware how we 
trust to the world shakspeare calls it 

the guiled shore 

to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf 
veiling an indian beauty in a word 
the seeming truth which cunning times put on 
to entrap the wisest 

as to history it is full of practical warnings on 
the subject before us let us take one as an example 
of the rest when the greeks after a ten years 
siege found themselves unable to take troy by 
force they feigned an abandonment and left behind 



sec deductive logic practice 

them a large wooden horse filled with armed men 
this being dragged into the city by the credulous 
trojans the men left their concealment in the night 
opened the city gates and gave admission to the be 
siegers thus fell troy and thus are all persons 
liable to be lured to their destruction who will not 
mistrust appearances when there is danger of being 
deceived 

let us then in passing through life never be too 
secure or confiding but when new doctrines are 
offered to our notice or new inventions that throw 
the old into the shade or new acquaintances whose 
manners are more engaging than those of tried friends 
let us suspend our judgement and not be carried

 experience in aiding pupils to develop their knowledge 
will soon make manifest that according to the disposition of 
each and the qualities of his understanding he will infringe 
the laws of logical deduction in one or the other of the follow 
ing ways 

 by verbiage 

 by confused reasoning 

 by disjointed reasoning 

verbiage 

 verbiage is an art which stands by itself it is the art 
of joining wellsounding words into correct forms of sentences 
with little or no regard to any resulting sense the art of 
using language grammatically but not logically the art of 
appearing to reason and employing words for this end but of 
employing them in the absence of the knowledge which they 
ought to include we here call it an art it is an art in the 
bad sense of the term 

f a pupil who has read but has not thought a great deal 
will have his memory stored with book phraseology but will 
be deficient in such knowledge as may be justly called his 
own he can supply this deficiency only by a determination 
carried into practice of reasoning from things and con 
sequently of going back to the inductive process whenever 
his knowledge of things shall fail him but if instead of 
taking this course he seeks only to make a parade of know 
ledge by joining terms and phrases familiar to his memory 
which look well to the eye and perhaps sound well to the 
oar his beginning exercise will in kind and character re 
semble the following example 

 much of what follows and portions of what precedes i have already 
jmhlished in a little work called practical logic or hints to theme

 on education 

the invaluable blessings of a refined education are 
so multifarious in their extent and so incalculable in 
their essence that the understanding and the imagina 
tion are equally unable to comprehend the phenomena 
involved in the boundless subject who indeed can 
justly appreciate the ineffable advantages which ac 
crue to gifted individuals ardent to exhume the 
germs of scientific lore and attain the opulent results 
of disciplinary progress educational instruction exalts 
the faculties animates the mind improves the under 
standing and by throwing a divine light on the 
abstract operations of human intellect gives a new 
grace to the whole character through the instru 
mentality of the influence which education alone can 
impart we are lifted to another sphere in short 
education is the first of things the masterkey the 
universal good and we are bound at once to reve 
rence its authority and apply to its pure fountain for 
mental delight and intellectual improvement 
let it be supposed that this exercise has been written by a 
pupil after a conversation with his teacher on the subject to 
be developed now when a pupil makes proper use of a 
conversation so given in aid the fact that all the immediate 
knowledge he develops has been supplied by the teacher is 
no impeachment of the soundness or reality of the pupils 
knowledge for all our knowledge is acquired chiefly from 
what others communicate how and at what time is of 
little moment provided the instructed mind completely em 
braces and appropriates the knowledge but there is this 
difference between two pupils so assisted by a teacher the 
one forgets the phrases and forms of speech because his un 
derstanding has been intent on the things signified and not 
on the words and therefore in embodying the reasoning 
his style will be his own not an imitation of his teachers 
the other carries away little more than words and phrases 
such as he has been accustomed to admire in reading and 
these he puts together in the best way he can so as to form 
an exercise more or less resembling the example just given 
such an exercise is not a beginners essay in methodical think 

e 



 manual of logic chap v 

ing it is an exercise in an art whose purpose is to conceal 
the absence of distinct thought and the teacher to do his 
pupil justice must run his pen through the whole essay and 
require a new beginning upon what to such a pupil will be 
altogether a new principle not so with the other supposed 
pupil let the expression of thought be ever so poor and 
meagre yet if his exercise contain clear evidence that the 
mind has been at work on the subject suggested it ought to 
be accepted as a beginning of logical effort improvement 
will come with practice if the early deficiencies are pointed 
out and understood the faults which such a learner is 
likclv to commit are described and exemplified under the 
two general heads that follow 

confused reason in 

 this fault when it becomes evident in language will 
be found to arise from the absence of proper distinctions and 
divisions 

 the following which is an exercise by a very young 
logician on the same subject as the previous example and 
may be supposed the result of the same previous suggestions 
will serve to show the nature of the fault 

 on education 

education is certainly one of the most important 
things which belong to man and the most useful and 
essential of any it we reflect what a wild savage 
race we should be if it were not for this inestimable 
blessing and how very fortunatr they ought to think 
themselves who have friends both able and willing 
to provide the means of it without which we should 
not know the author of our existence to whom we 
are indebted for all our blessings and comforts and 
we should not be able to provide for ourselves for 
it is not the same with man as it is with birds which 
instinct teaches to provide for themselves when they 
leave the nest of their paients instead of which we 
are not only made agreeable in society but if we

make a proper use of it it is the source of all hap 
piness and therefore since we are sensible of its 
worth let us who possess it think ourselves unspeak 
ably happy and never think it too much trouble to 
obtain for surely it is the least we can do for such a 
valuable benefit 

this production deficient as it is in all the other requisites 
of good composition is not without some evidence of real 
thinking let this then serve as an example of the first 
formal attempt in the art which is treated of in these pages 
the correction of the exercise with a clear understanding on 
the pupils part of the nature and purpose of the corrections 
will complete and constitute his first practical lesson in logic 
let him observe then that he has run on from the beginning 
to the end of his exercise without a single division and that 
he has used no stop but the comma till he has reached his 
full stop at the end now though it is true that grammar is 
one thing in theory and logic another and that the stops are 
regulated by grammar and not by logic yet grammar and 
logic go together in practice and there cannot be confusion in 
the former that does not tend to obscurity in the latter let 
him therefore look with the eye of a grammarian on his 
work and he will see that grammatical construction is often 
complete where he has put only a comma complete con 
struction always requires one of the higher stops strictly 
the periodic or full stop but at least the colon or semicolon 
the logical connection is not broken by these marks of gram 
matical completeness but on the contrary is made clearer 
construction may and must frequently pause while the logical 
process continues supposing this process to be of any length 
and these constructional pauses must be indicated by the 
usual points further let the learner observe that his line 
of argument naturally diverges from two points namely 
 the importance of education and our consequent duty 
as young students so that the whole theme separates into two 
subjected themes that ought to be implied though not for 
mally named by a division or break in the writing exhibiting 
the whole theme in two paragraphs thus by logical sul 
division and grammatical division with a few minor correc 
tions the whole theme will take the following shape

 on education 

education is the most important and essential 
concern of man for let us reflect what a wild 
savage creature he would be without this inestimable 
blessing he would not know the author of his 
existence to whom he is indebted for all his comforts 
he would not be able to provide for himself for 
it is not the same with man as it is with birds 
they know almost entirely by instinct how to provide 
for themselves but all knowledge necessary to man 
comes by education it is education which lifts him 
from his helpless state makes him an agreeable mem 
ber of society and prepares him for all happiness 

since then education is so important let us to 
whom it is offered think ourselves unspeakably happy 
and never imagine we can employ too much pains to 
secure all its advantages let us reflect how very 
fortunate we are in having friends both able and 
willing to provide the means of instruction and let 
us show our gratitude by our willingness to learn 
which is surely the least return we can make for 
benefits so valuable 

disjointed reasoning 

 disjointed reasoning is the development of knowledge 
in parts not properly connected with each other the pro 
positions may be separately true but the truth of the one 
a not lead to or flow from that of the other 

 warned by the confusedness which appeared in his first 
attempt and aiming at the greater distinctness of the cor 
rected copy the learner will perhaps at the next attempt 
produce an exercise formed of sentences after the following 
manner 

 on friendship 

friendship is a subject which has often employed 
the pen of the moralist we all feel that friendship 
is necessary to our happiness many persons pretend 
to be influenced by friendship who are incapable of

so noble a sentiment without a friend the world 
c c 

sentences of this kind do not form discourse they indeed 
all relate to the same subject or theme in one sense of the 
word but they do not constitute a theme in the other sense 
they are so many distinct propositions and ought indeed not 
to be written down in immediate succession but with breaks 
in the manner of paragraphs thus 

 friendship is a subject that has often employed 
the pen of the moralist 

 we all feel that friendship is necessary to our 
happiness 

 many persons pretend to be influenced by friend 
ship who are incapable of so noble a sentiment 
this is the way to write maxims or proverbs but a theme 
must be managed very differently we must not start from 
one proposition to another which has no immediate relation 
to it but consider in what way our knowledge may be 
further and further developed in the direction which the 
initiatory proposition indicates till nothing more in this direc 
tion seems necessary to be said suppose a proposition 
should appear destitute of a purpose which can be thus car 
ried out we must either reject it altogether or by some 
addition give it a purpose with relation to what we choose 
shall follow it the first of the foregoing propositions will 
exemplify what is here meant friendship is a subject that 
has often employed the pen of the moralist it seems hardly 
worth while to make this observation for the sake of itself 
we expect something to follow which may define its purpose 
for example 

 friendship is a subject that has so often employed the 
pen of the moralist that the few thoughts it may sug 
gest to my mind cannot be either novel or striking 
yet my remarks though trite may deserve some 
attention because the subject itself is of the highest 
importance 

thus carried out into a rational consequence and a re 
joinder to that consequence the original proposition becomes 
a proper introductory paragraph the next independent pro 
position may now be taken and followed up thus 

 see section page 



 manual of logic cliap v 

 we all feel that friendship is necessary to our hap 
piness individually weak we stand in continual need 
of assistance support advice and sympathy but 
the coldness of the world and even the indifference 
of our own hearts to all except a few by whom we 
are surrounded soon teach us that without sincere 
friends we may look for these good offices in vain 
therefore we always flatter ourselves we possess 
friends though there are many who pass through life 
unendeared to a single heart and who are never 
served or assisted but through motives of interest or 
of fear 

this paragraph being completed we may take the next 
independent proposition as the ground for a third 

 many persons pretend to be influenced by friend 
ship who are incapable of so noble a sentiment the 
selfish cannot feel it they will connect themselves 
with others to reap some immediate advantage but 
they are ever strangers to that regard which frames 
to itself a happiness out of the happiness of others 
all their views are of profit or of pleasure solely to 
themselves yet none are more ready than the selfish 
to give the colouring of friendship to all their actions 
because they know this to be the most likelv means 
of securing the return of greater benefits than they 
yield 

it is to be observed that not only should the sentences of 
the same paragraph k lo t iri ally connected but the paragraphs 
themselves should have a closer relation than merely that of 
treating of the same subject therefore though the foregoing 
iaph may not be liable to any objection in itself yet 
when placed beside the other it appears to be defective by 
not being consequent on what preceded it this fault may 
be corrected by drawing such a consequence from the second 
paragraph as may serve for the ground of the third for 
example 

 as friendship is so important toward the hap 
piness of life we cannot be too careful in our choice 
of friends lst v place a reliance on those who will 
desert and betray us in the hour of difficulty and dis 
tress for it is but too true that many persons 
pretend to be influenced c 



ec j errors in deductive practice 

a short practical conclusion carried on from the word 
 yield in unison with the commencement thus prefixed to 
the paragraph will give a finish to the whole theme thus 

 against such pretended friendship let confiding 
generosity be ever on its guard 

 thus it appears that a theme ought to be free from 
verbiage that the parts ought to be properly arranged 
and that the thoughts should flow from and support each 
other every fault which the learner is likely to incur will 
be some special mode of violating one or the other of these 
three general rules 

under verbiage the more special names may be petitio 
principii a latin phrase implying the demand for our proof 
of the wry thing to be proved nonsequitur another latin 
phrase which means that what is appended as a consequence 
does not follow as a consequence and error in distinction or 
division which amounts to no distinction or division at all 
again petitioprincipii may so occur as to allow of still more 
special designations namely begging the question identical 
proposition explaining a thing ty itself and reasoning in a 
circle so the fault of nonsequitur may occur in such a 
manner as to be designated irrelevant premises in which the 
inconsequence is obvious and proving too little or proving too 
much in which the inconsequence is real yet less obvious 
so again error in distinction or division branches into dis 
tinction without a difference and confusion of cross divisions 

under confused reasoning the special descriptions of 
fault may be saying other than is meant not distinguishing 
different senses of the same word neglecting the means of dis 
tinction and division which grammar provides for the clear develop 
ment of thought 

under disjointed reasoning the special descriptions may 
be omitting necessary propositions proposing too much or too 
little deviation from the proposition discoursing short of the 
proposition discoursing wide of the proposition all these 
may have for their general title as well disjointed eeasoning 
as the latin phrase ignoratio elenchi which implies forge t 
fulness or omission of the point to be made out or developed 

the following synopsis will render the previous explanation 
at once intelligible

errors in detail which come under the general head 
of verbiage 

 begging the question is verbiage exhibited in such 
form of the petitio principii that the pretended reasoner in a 
more palpable way than under the other forms begs that to 
admitted for a reason of what he asserts which is no reason 
at all but only the assertion repeated in the same or in tan 
tamount words as 

 pride is odious because it is disliked by all for it pro 
duces universal hatred 

here the words because and for lead us to expect a de 
velopment of the cause that makes pride odious and of the 
effects which prove it so instead of which we have two pro 
positions which only repeat in tantamount words what the 
first had said omit the words because andybr and the defect 
disappears we shall indeed have three propositions each 
meaning the same thing but such repetition though logically 
superfluous is not always a fault in rhetoric and in the pre 
sent instance must be indulged by logic as minister to the 
sister art as pride is odious it is disliked by all it 
produces universal hatred such is one way of correcting 
the fault namely by not raising the question of the truth oi 
what is asserted and therefore making no pretence of giving 
a reason for it but the mode of correction more agreeable 

 to give a reason is but to develop our knowledge with greater detail 
wo have ahvavs to jutlf whether this is or is not expedient in saying 
pride is odious we already express a conclusion from premises namely 



sec errors in deductive practice 

to logic will be to carry out the purpose of because or or by 
adding a legitimate reason for instance pride is odious 
because our selflove makes us feel it as an injury done to our 
own importance which is an argument from the topic 
cause and pride is odious for all persons shun the society 
of the proud which is an argument from the topic effect 

 identical proposition this form of petitio prindpii 
differs from the last in no greater degree than its name indi 
cates it is a grammatical period whose two parts are iden 
tical in meaning thus in saying all being exists we 
have a period dividing into nominative and verb but the one 
means the same as the other and therefore in putting them 
together there is no resulting sense no conclusion from the 
two but only a repetition of the same thing under a different 
form again in saying as the tree enlarges so does its 
size increase we have a period dividing into two sentences 
rendered grammatically dependent by as and so but the one 
sentence means exactly what the other means and no sense 
results from their grammatical union so likewise in saying 
 home is home we have a grammatical sentence dividing 
into home the nominative and is home the verb and if we 
understand no more from the latter than from the former the 
sentence says nothing it is in fact an illogical because an 
identical proposition though rhetoric vindicates it by imply 
ing under the verb a great deal more than it actually ex 
presses the following are other examples that neither logic 
nor rhetoric vindicates 

 the vain and empty glory of this world is but nothing 
ness 

here the verbiage will be corrected and the sentence be 
come rational by leaving out vain and empty 

 foolishly do the vain triflers we so often meet with in 
life squander their useless hours in futile pursuits while they 
neglect the needful duties which they ought to perform and 
are guilty of continual faults which they ought to avoid 



from pride and is odious knowing what pride is we know the feeling 
it produces in others knowing what it is to be odious we know what 
effects go along with the quality in the deductive process the alleging 
of reasons is nothing more or other than bringing forward prominently 
what thus lies behind the premises of our first proposition 



lo manual of logic chap v 

the verbiage of this example will appear by comparing it 
with the following correction 

 many whom we meet with in life neglect their duties 
and squander their hours in futile pursuits 

 a good definition should include all the things to which 
the word defined is applied 

the verbiage lies in using good in constructing the nomi 
native along with should in constructing the verb we ought 
to say either a definition should include c or a 
good definition includes c 

 explaining a thing by itself this form of petitio 
principii differs so little from the last that it may scarcely 
seem to require a distinct designation but as when only a 
verbal explanation is meant using another word having ex 
actly the same signification is not a fault the learner may 
require to be reminded that this will be verbiage when the 
thing is to be explained that is to say the equivalent word 
will not explain the thing but only be another word for it 
it is for instance a fair verbal explanation of justice to say 
that it is the quality of being just but it is a cheat upon the 
understanding to deem that by saying so we have in any 
degree developed our knowledge of the thing we should 
equally fail though the fault might be more concealed if 
with an exactly equivalent meaning we were to use a different 
word if for instance we said justice is the quality of being 
equitable hence the following passage is a failure 

 justice regards both magistrates and private individuals 
the former show themselves to be influenced by it when they 
make an equitable distribution of rewards and punishments 
the latter when they are sincere in their words and just in 
their dealings 

let impartial and honest be substituted for equitable and 
just and the verbiage will be corrected 

 reasoning in a circle tliis form of petitio principii 
takes place when we go on proving one proposition by 
another on the understood condition that the last which is 
to establish the rest will be selfevident and then instead 
of fulfilling the implied condition we return to our first 
assertion and use that for our proof when it was the very 

 see chapter iii section page 



sec errors in deductive practice 

thing to be proved thus it is obvious verbiage to say 
 pride is odious because it offends our selflove and it 
offends our selflove because it is odious the fault is less 
obvious but equally present in the following example 

 wealth makes the mind uneasy for it fills it full of 
care of care for its increase of care lest it should diminish 
of care to prevent one portion from being lost while we are 
watching for another and that all these effects are engendered 
by the possession of wealth is established by the fact that wherever 
we find riches we are sure to find uneasiness and disquietude 
also 

the latter part of this example so far as it pretends to be 
an argument for what precedes is verbiage 

 we proceed to a third example 

 the formal syllogism of aristotle is the test of all valid 
reasoning all reasoning being invalid which conforms not to 
its formulae eg all vegetables grow an animal grows 
therefore it is a vegetable all wise legislators suit their 
laws to the genius of their country solon did this therefore 
he was a wise legislator now both these apparent syllo 
gisms and all similar to them so the argument continues 
 refuse the test which aristotelian logic provides and both 
of them so the argument still continues are instances of 
invalid reasoning 

when in proceeding to answer the argument it is asked 
why the latter instance as well as the former is an instance 
of invalid reasoning the answer given is this 

 that the latter as well as the former refuses the test 
which the aristotelian syllogism provides 

here it is clearly evident that the reasoner goes back to 
the proposition he had to prove namely that the formal 
syllogism of aristotle is the test of all valid reasoning in 
order to answer the question why the reasoning is wrong in 
saying all wise legislators suit their laws to the genius of 
their country solon did this therefore he was a wise legis 
lator that the reasoning here is confusedly expressed we 
acknowledge f but that it is wrong reasoning can never be 
established by so palpable an argument in a circle as the 

 see the second footnote page 

f the true character of the fault with which this latter of the two 
examples is chargeable will be assigned in the next section 



 manual of logic chapv 

instance supplies and yet it is one of the modes of proof 
pursued in favour of aristotelian logic in the most popular 
logical treatise of the day 

 irrklkvant premises prem ises are irrelevant vlin 
what is said to follow from them does not follow as 
 every horse is an animal sheep are not horses therefore 
they are not animals it is a designation by which we may 
distinguish one of the modes of the general fault called a non 
sequitur namely that in which the premises are quite void 
of consequence 

if our theory of deductive logic is true a nonseqmtur in 
thought is impossible in the induction of knowledge that 
is in gathering it into the mind we may indeed make the 
most unwarrantable assumptions and the most fatal mistakes 
and in developing our knowledge these errors will reappear 
but they will appear as premises with no possibility if we 
do not give up thought for words with no possibility of flaw 
in the validity of our conclusions inasmuch as every conclu 
sion from premises is but the fact of developing our know 
ledge real or assumed and of understanding our premises 
and with relation to its actual premises a conclusion cannot 
but be what it is we can no more choose in the case than 
we can choose in the case of sensation than we can choose 
for instance what our snsation shall whn certain food is 
oil red to the palate or a certain shape to the eye let us 
know what red and also what earth is and the moment these 
are embraced as premises by the understanding is the moment 
of our beinn aware of the meaning which as one expression 
they signify and this is the conclusion from those premises 
which conclusion if the premises are not mistaken cannot be 
other than it is in like manner let us know that men are 
mortal and that kings are men and the moment the under 
standing embraces these as premises is the moment of our 
lcinu aware of the conclusion that kings are mortal a con 
clusion which with regard to the actual premises cannot be 
avoided and cannot but be what it is 

a false conclusion then with relation to its actual pre 
mises leino impossible we have to ask how there can be 
such a thing as a false conclusion at all and the answer is 

 see the second footnote page 



sec errors in deductive practice 

that in the deductive process there can indeed be no such 
thing except when words are made to take the place of 
thought let us know what square means and what a circle 
means and it will be impossible for the understanding to 
embrace these as premises and receive the grammatical com 
bination as a conclusion nevertheless the grammatical com 
bination a square circle may be offered as a conclusion and 
may be by him accepted who takes words for thought in 
like manner let us know what vegetables are and what ani 
mals are and it will be impossible though our knowledge 
includes the fact that they both grow it will be impossible 
for the understanding to embrace these as premises so as to 
receive as a conclusion that an animal is a vegetable yet 
this again may be offered as a conclusion and may again be 
by him accepted who reasons not by means of words but 
imitates that process by operating with words and failing in 
the operation which it is not difficult to do reaches that 
which in the true process of reasoning is an impossible 
result now if the shrewdest of the present or any other 
generation were to employ his wits in devising an instrument 
by which in failing to use it according to rule it should be 
possible to come to conclusions of the kind here exemplified 
he would not be likely to contrive anything so extremely 
ingenious as the instrument which has been in existence and 
partially in use for some two thousand years the syllogism 
of aristotle with its apparatus of extremes and middle term 
for this instrument as its advocates declare proposes rules 
of reasoning which have nothing to do with the truth or 
falsity of premises but merely teach us to decide not whether 
the premises are fairly laid down but whether the conclusion 
fairly follows from the premises if the theory of our 
logic is true this is something more preposterous than pro 
viding spectacles for them who cannot but see clearly or 
crutches for them who cannot but walk well let us how 
ever take the instrument as it is put into our hands and 
acknowledging that it guards the reasoner against a wrong 
use of its forms acknowledging this we say that in using 
it we are rendered liable to traps and snares which would 
not come in our way if we reasoned without it the 

 whatelys logic province of reasoning chap i ad finem 



 manual of logic chapv 

conclusiveness of an argument say its advocates is by 
this instrument mak manifest by the mere force 
 of the expression i e without considering the meaning of the 
terms admitted but when the reasoner has dismissed 
all attention to the meaning there is at least a possibility that 
he should fail to employ the exact form and employ one 
which seems a legitimate syllogism but is not one all 
vegetables grow an animal grows therefore it is a vege 
table the apparent conclusion is of course a nonsequitur 
both in aristotles logic and in ours in aristotles with 
reference to its defect in form the fault is specially described 
as an illicit process of the major or nondistribution of the 
major term in the premises in ours we call it irrelevant 
premises that is premises that cannot be embraced by the 
understanding cannot be correctly understood so that the 
last proposition is inevitable in the act of understanding them 
and the practical difference we insist on is this that in 
using aristotles instrument there may occur the failure which 
produces the apparent conclusion in using language for the 
purpose of reasoning as our theory requires the failure cannot 
in tie shape exemplified occur 

before we conclude the present section with a few examples 
to the same purpose as the foregoing we must vindicate from 
thf charge of irrelevant premises though we cannot from that 
of illicit process an example associated in section above 
with a foregoing example in which an animal is made a vege 
tull that other example was all wise legislators suit 
their laws to the genius of their country solon did this 
therefore he was a wise legislator according to our logic 
this is correct though confused reasoning and as an example 
of confused reasoning it will again occur in a subsequent 
section it is correct because the argument with its conclu 
sion solon suited his laws to the genius of his country and 
therefore was a wise legislator implies by its being put 
forward as an argument for that conclusion the datum which 
really exists in the understanding of the reasoner namely that

confusion is removed by removing the irrelevant proposition 
when what remains will be the premises namely datum and 
argument compendiously expressed or the irrelevant propo 
sition may be changed so that it shall accurately correspond to 
the datum in his mind 

of examples of irrelevant premises the snares and traps 
into which we are liable to run through an incautious trust in 
aristotelian forms and a nonobservance of their rules the 
following are appended as further specimens 

 if the hourhand of a clock be any distance say a foot 
before the minutehand the last though moving twelve times 
faster can never overtake the other for while the minute 
hand is moving over those twelve inches the hourhand will 
have moved over one inch so that they will then be an inch 
apart and while the minutehand is moving over that one 
inch the hourhand will have moved over t v of an inch so 
that it will still be ahead and again while the minutehand 
is passing over the space of j inch which now divides them 
the hourhand will pass over t inch so that it will still be 
ahead though the distance between the two is diminished 
c c c and thus it is plain we may go on for ever 
therefore the minutehand can never overtake the hourhand 

this example which brings us to a conclusion contradictory 
to our clearest experience is liable to be startling to a person 
who has any reliance on the mere forms of reasoning more 
especially if he is acquainted with the truth that in mathe 
matics there are lines under certain conditions which though 
they are always approaching can never meet but this 
which in certain cases can be true of abstract lines that is 
lines unlimited by place time or dimensions cannot of 
course be true in physics how then is the appearance of 
truth given to the foregoing form of reasoning by relying 
on the farm so as to keep the true datum or knowledge out 
of sight namely that the hourhand can never overtake 
the minutehand within the space at which they are at any time 
asunder but that this space will continually diminish till at 
last there shall be no space between them it is now 
evident that no argument can be joined with this datum 
which shall not be irrelevant to that which is appended as 
a conclusion namely therefore the minutehand can 
never overtake the hourhand

were whites therefore they wen civilil 

 none but whites are civilized the hindoos are not 
whites therefore they are not civilized 

 none but civilied people were whites the greeks

these are traps intended for the nonaristotelian reasoner 
who in trying to grasp the knowledge held out in the i 
mises is beset by difficulties which the aristotelian do 
concern himself with difficulties arising ironi the nature of 
the subjects inasmuch as white men and dark men civilized 
men and uncivilized men are not separated in point of fact by 
any determinate line but run into each other our reasoner 
will hence be inclined to deem each example inconcli 
and when the aristotelian lhvs him to take the prenii 
each for granted and then to distinguish the faulty example 
he will find no one faulty beyond some confusion of expression 
inasmuch as in each instance the argument the second pro 
position involves the datum required in the very act of 
being put forward to reach the appended conclusion thus 
the atum which he understand in the first example is all 
whites were civilized nor is it of moment to him except 
from the confusion it creates that the first proposition is 
irrelevant as tjiere expressed since the second and third con 
tain to his understanding the premises he is called upon to 
admit the aristotelian indeed exclaims nonsequitur 
undistributed middle but what is this to him who reasons 
not with words but only by means of words or what ad 
mission has been drawn from him which is likely to mislead 
his understanding in the future course of the reasoning

these are traps for the aristotelian reasoner and not foi 
ours it is true the latter may in the induction of his 
knowledge have been led in such a case as the first to bring 
under one term things in their nature different and hence 
because his premises were wrong to deduce in thought and 
practice a wrong conclusion to deem for instance as 
indicated by the example in view that food which weighs 
light in proportion to its quantity is on this account light of 
digestion but being taught to look to the subjectmatter of 
his premises as the only source of invalidity in his conclusions 
he is surely less likely than a reasoner not so taught to rest 
satisfied with his deductions the other examples can 
scarcely deceive him for a moment to his understanding the 
premises in all will at once appear irrelevant to their re 
spective conclusions nor can they in fact deceive any one 
but a reasoner who gives up all attention to the subject 
matter of his argument and trusts entirely to its form 
indeed we may fairly ask of the aristotelian reasoner why 
on his principles these forms of argument are not received 
to say that we must not here rely on the forms but go back 
to the meaning of the terms is to confess after all that the 
subjectmatter is everything and the forms nothing hence 
it is matter of complaint with dr whately that when 
aristotelian teachers come to fallacies thus protected as it 
were by the very form of the syllogism they have recourse 
in order to expose them to a loose vague and popular 
kind of language which may be translated to mean that 
they now employ for the first time the language of common 
sense in order to reach the common human understanding

them of the shelter of technical language by which the 
esoterical disciple may still be kept aloof from the common

 proving too little this must be a nonsequitur 
a physical or real one the facts of the case not reaching what 
we seek to establish as when we say our friend john 
never cheats or steals and therefore he is a man of every 
virtue the words and therefore are verbiage what follows 
them may be true but not true as a consequence of what 
precedes the same fault a little more concealed is exem 
plified in the following 

 no man can be happy who pursues nothing but pleasure 
for to procure what the world calls pleasure requires money 
health and spirits but most men who always pursue plea 
sure will be always wanting some of these 

nothing more is here proved admitting what is averred 
than that most men who pursue pleasure cannot be happy 
the full proof would not be difficult by a wider induction of 
particulars and it is only necessary to remind the young 
logician that when he intends to establish a truth he should 
bring forward all the facts which may force a reasonable 
mind to admit it he might for instance aver as to the 
proposition in view that the constant pursuit of what the 
world calls pleasure unwarranted as it is by reason and 
conscience will ever be found to harass the spirits undermine 
the health produce languor and satiety and at last instead 
of real enjoyment leave nothing to the feelings but disgust 
and pain 

returning to the uncorrected examples it may be observed 
that in all cases of proving too little we supply mentally an 
unwarranted datum and we prove too little because that 
datum must be proved before our conclusion will hold 
tims in the first example above the implied datum is he 
who never cheats or steals is a man of every virtue grant 
this and the conclusion is undeniable but it cannot be 
granted and hence the defect of having proved too little it 
is indeed the error of our lives to take the data which our 
wishes our passions our prejudices suggest before we have 
accumulated knowledge on adequate grounds but the error 



sec llj errors in deductive practice 

be it observed is always in the inductive process in this 
process the conclusion which is properly and strictly called 
an inference never follows necessarily from the premises 
because it is never included in them but is more or less 
probable up to the highest degree of certainty which our 
knowledge can reach a certainty different in kind from neces 
sary certainty though it is the certainty from which flow all 
our necessary conclusions in the deductive process let us 
take the following instance this stone which i have 
lifted from the ground and let go has fallen to the ground 
again therefore if i lift it again and again let it go it mil 
again fall to the ground the inference is not a necessary 
conclusion but who for a moment doubts its certainty 
that on which its certainty rests is the wide universal 
induction of particular facts which never having failed the 
habit of our understandings leads us to accept as what never 
will fail in the deductive process then the datum which 
the foregoing inference supplies has the utmost possible 
degree of strength namely that every stone lifted from 
the ground and let go having fallen to the ground every 
stone that shall be lifted and let go will fall very dif 
ferent in degree of certainty are the data supplied by innu 
merable inferences which we incautiously accept in the accu 
mulation of our knowledge let us take a few by way of 
specimen 

 i am sure the man is a rogue he has such an evil 
looking face i e he has an evillooking face therefore he 
is a rogue 

 i have often observed that when it rains on friday it 
also rains on sunday now yesterday was friday and it 
rained hard therefore i am sure it will rain tomorrow 

 i got well while i was taking this drug therefore it 
cured me 

 i have never begun anything on a friday without being 
unlucky therefore it is unlucky for any one to begin any 
thing on a friday 

 everybody suspects john of having taken my purse 
therefore he stole it

 miss a according to my idea is very ugly though i 
hear her beauty so much cried up therefore she is very 
ugly 

 this food is extremely grateful and nutritious to the 
people living within the tropics therefore it is fit food for all 
people 

in all the foregoing examples after the prior shape of 
the first the word therefore is so used as to be palpable 
verbiage and thus the fault is in each made more manifest 
than it would be if couched in more common forms of 
speech but the more it is concealed the more cause has 
the young logician to be on his guard he must remember 
that whenever he reaches an inference by too narrow an 
induction his conclusion in the development of his knowledge 
necessary as it will be from the datum he assumes must at 
the same time be without value for he will always in such 
a case prove too little the conclusion he reaches will not be 
a logical or in other words a metaphysical nonsequitur but 
it will be a physical or real one 

 proving too much this will also be a real non 
sequitur because if our proof includes more than can be 
true that which may be true will not follow from it it may 
be true that the drug which john took when he was ill 
cured him but when in order to establish this presumed 
truth we aver that the illness of samuel and that of thomas 
and that of william were cured by the same drug the 
several diseases being distinct and in some degree opposite in 
character so that the same drug could not have had the 
sunn effect on all we prove too much and the proposition 
 because john took the drug he got well remains un 
proved by it hence the connecting word because is verbiage 
and to correct the example we must leave it out and put 
and between the sentences the same fault of proving too 
much occurs in the following example 

 no one can live a happy life who pursues nothing but 
pleasure for it is in the nature of things that when a man 
gives himself up to one pursuit it becomes tiresome there 
fore people who are always following pleasure do not take 
delight in it but pass a troubled uneasy dissatisfied life 



sec errors in deductive practice 

if it were generally true as here said that when a man 
gives himself up to one pursuit it becomes tiresome then 
would it be true that in giving himself up to the pursuit of 
wisdom knowledge virtue or other excellent thing the 
pursuit would grow tiresome a conclusion which we know 
to be false it is true only of pleasure that when pursued 
to the exclusion of other occupations it no longer produces 
the effect desired from it but becomes disgust and pain 

in these last examples as well as in those of the previous 
section we supply mentally an unwarranted datum the 
difference is that in the former cases the induction on 
which we assume each datum is too narrow that is it has 
not collected a sufficient number of facts to warrant the 
datum while in the latter case it is too wide that is it has 
included more facts than there was just ground for an 
example of the latter occurred in the last section but one in 
which a reasoner is supposed in the induction of his know 
ledge to have included under the word light things of a very 
different nature so as to persuade himself that all light food 
is good for him the argument proves too much for it 
includes all food specifically light further experience may 
correct the error and then he will be aware why his former 
conclusion was wrong namely that the argument included in 
the word light proved too much and therefore for his true 
instruction and benefit proved nothing a few more exam 
ples of the same kind may be sufficient to show how liable 
we are to these conclusions which flow from proving too much 

 liberty is a blessing to man without limiting the cir 
cumstances that make it a blessing therefore let us im 
pose no laws on these uninstructed men but allow them to 
do whatever they wish 

 pleasure is a good which i eagerly desire without 
discriminating between pleasure which is enduring and plea 
sure which must turn to evil therefore i will plunge into 
the sensual revelry which invites me on every side 

wealth procures great advantages without discri 
minating advantages which by itself it cannot procure 
 therefore i will accumulate wealth in every way and at all 
hazards

minating the circumstances that make them so therefore 
i will scruple no means to raise myself to rank and power 

 to make others fear to injure me is judicious without 
regard to the fact that fear may keep all at a distance who 
would otherwise befriend me therefore i will never 
allow the least injury or even the least slight to remain un

 a b is our representative in parliament without

ment ought to consult the interests of the nation at large as

question bound to vote as we namely c d and e direct 
him 

the conclusion which the reasoner attains in all these 
instances though by granting him in each the implied datum 
it is logically metaphysically correct is nevertheless really 
physically false in other words a real nonsequitur 

 distinction without a difference we now reach 
another of the general forms of verbiage namely error in 
distinction or division of which one of the species is that 
named above it may be sufficient to warn the learner 
against the fault abovenamed by the following examples 

 i propose to consider first the evils which arise from 
procrastination and then the miseries we should avoid by 
performing our duties at their proper time and place 

the reasoner is guilty of verbiage in this distinction or if 
he really means different things he must mean first the 
evils of procrastination and then the benefits of performing 
c the following are two other examples 

 books are the receptacles of knowledge and the deposi 
tories in which the collected wisdom of ages is treasured up 
 docility is a readiness to receive instruction and a 
willing obedience to those who teach 

in both these instances the word and converts what follows 
into verbiage leave it out and the verbiage is corrected 
we shall it is true then have in each example two expres 
sions to the same purpose but these will be used as two 
nouns are used in apposition the one to make the meaning of 
the other better understood without pretending to add any 



sec errors in deductive practice 

thing new to the meaning and as adding what is no addi 
tion always amounts to a distinction without a difference so 
likewise does disjoining what is not distinct as 

 to be neither merciful nor compassionate is unsuitable 
to the condition of man 

here to avoid verbiage we must say not to be mer 
ciful not to be compassionate is unsuitable c or 
avoiding the repetition not to be compassionate is unsuit 
able c 

in rhetoric the earnestness of a speaker to make the most 
of a point frequently produces a redundancy of words when 
nothing is added to the meaning but in logic such a redun 
dancy is a fault and if very palpable will not answer the 
purpose even of the rhetorician the following sentences 
are therefore faulty 

 this great politician desisted from and renounced his 
designs when he found them impracticable 

 he was of so high and independent a spirit that he 
abhorred and detested being in debt 

 though raised to an exalted station he was a pattern of 
piety virtue and religion 

 his end soon approached and he died with great 
courage and fortitude 

 he was a man of so much pride and vanity that he 
despised the sentiments of others 

 poverty induces and cherishes dependence and depend 
ence increases and strengthens corruption 

 this man on all occasions treated his inferiors with 
great haughtiness and disdain 

 there can be no regularity or order in the life and con 
duct of that man who does not give and allot a due share of 
his time to retirement and reflection 

 such equivocal and ambiguous expressions mark a 
formed intention to deceive and abuse us

up a kind of daylight in his mind excludes every gloomy 
prospect and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity

another division thus a bookbinder divides books into 
folio quarto octavo duodecimo c a philosopher into 
poetical historical c a philologist into greek latin 
english french c now a logician would be guilty of 
a great error if he were to confuse these several divisions by 
dividing books in general into the several species of poetical 
historical folio quarto greek latin c for these are not 
divisions under one general head which includes them but 
divisions under particular heads for special purposes sup 
pose therefore that in a theme on history the writer should 
set out with a division into sacred profane ancient and 
modern he at once plunges into verbiage because sacred 
history is not distinct from ancient but happens to be in 
cluded in it and because profane history is not distinct from 
modern but happens to include it the divisions are never 
theless just if he does not confuse the one set with the other 
we run into the same fault when we say 

 the human body is divided into the head trunk limbs 
and vitals 

for the vitals are included in the head or trunk or 
both and the division should be into head trunk and 
limbs so that the vitals if spoken of at all may be taken 
in subordination to what includes them 

the following are other instances in which the fault is 
sufficiently apparent 

 the things brought out to me were some square some 
white some artificial some round some blue some natural 
and some red

sec j errors in deductive practice 

be noticed are faults of expression being faults of reasoning 
only so far as faulty expression can scarcely fail to cloud and 
confuse the reasoning we assume logic to be the art of 
developing knowledge for our own security and satisfaction 
but always with a view of applying our skill ultimately to 
the purposes of rhetoric that is of informing convincing and 
persuading others now if we say other than we mean 
although what we mean may in some sort be present to our 
own understanding and although others may not altogether 
mistake what we mean yet there will on both sides be a 
degree of confusion which it is among the objects of logic to 
prevent the following examples therefore though faulty 
only in expression are properly deemed illogical 

 ambition is so insatiable that it will make any sacrifice 
to attain its objects 

 as to be content with what we have is to be truly rich 
it follows that no covetous man is truly rich 

 solon was a wise legislator for all wise legislators suit 
their laws to the genius of their nation 

each of these examples exhibits a nonsequitur in expression 
but it is in expression only the meaning which the reasoner 
designs to convey and that which in spite of the faulty ex 
pression the hearer or reader receives is the following am 
bition is so insatiable that however much it gets it will still 
desire more and make any sacrifice to attain it as no one 
is truly rich but he who is content it follows that no covetous 
man is truly rich solon was a wise legislator for all 
are wise legislators who suit their laws to the genius of their 
nation the expression in each example may be made cor 
rect in another way namely by foregoing the logical connec 
tion understood between the facts and stating them as things 
that only happen to come together as ambition is insa 
tiable it will make any sacrifice to attain its objects to 
be content with what we have is to be truly rich no covetous 
man is truly rich solon was a wise legislator he and 
all other wise legislators suit their laws to the genius of 
their nation this way of correcting a nonsequitur is left 
to our choice in cases like these when the fault was only in 
the expression and not in point of fact but we have no 
choice we must take the latter mode when the nonsequitur 
is of the latter kind as all vegetables grow an animal 

f 



 g ma x ual of logic chap v 

grows we cannot connect these by any logical conse 
quence they must be left in their independent state or joined 
in expression as we usually join things that happen to come 
together for example all vegetables grow and so dos 
an animal again in proposing to join round and square we 
find them irrelevant to any conclusion in other words they 
will not make sense and therefore instead of saying a rouitd 
square we must leave them independent of each others 
meaning and say a round and a square returning now to 
examples in which the nonsequitur is only in the expr 
we may indicate to the learner as specimens in point all those 
which were furnished in the manual of grammar pages 
 to discriminate between grammar and logic thus 
 he that was dead sat up each being taken strictly the 
two members of this sentence cannot unite and imply one 
sense but the former member is neither meant nor received 
according to its strict import and therefore it does unite 
with what follows the same thing might be shown of all 
the other examples at the pages referred to yet they all 
come under the censure of confused reasoning except one or 
two vindicated by rhetoric because in all of them the rea 
soner says other than he means 

it must be further borne in mind that not only should an 
expression convey none other than is meant but should like 
wise be free from a double meaning though one of the mean 
ings may be the one intended sometimes as in the case of 
pretended prophecy there may be a purpose in equivocation 
but with such a purpose logic is not concerned and in cor 
recting a few more examples continued from the manual of 
grammar the student will take care that each sentence shall 
convoy one and only one meaning

amples to those which exhibit the fault in the particular way 



 man u vl of logic chap v 

described above namely by not distinguishing different 
of the same word be it observed however that we are 
concerned with this fault only so far as it confuses the rea 
soning and not with that effect which was the subject of a 
previous section where it is shown that the reasoner in the 
induction of his knowledge is led to include under the same 
word as things of the same nature those that are essentially 
distinct and hence though he reasons rightly in the deduc 
tive process to come to a wrong conclusion because his pre 
vious knowledge is wrong see sect at page 
where the word light is alluded to in the following and 
other similar examples the reasoning independent of the 
words is correct but the expression makes it confused 

to write well is an accomplishment of the first import 
ance because we form an immediate judgement of a persons 
education from the manner in which he writes if we receive 
from any one a letter scarcely legible scrawled rather than 
written we hardly think well of the writers education 
though perhaps the sentiments may be tolerably expressed 
but if the language is ungrammatical and all the sentences 
confused in short if there appears a total deficiency of skill 
in the art of writing we immediately conclude that the per 
son is altogether ignorant and illiterate 

here bad writing hi the sense of bad manuscript and in the 
different sense of bad composition are confounded the in 
tended reasoning is made clearer thus to write a fair 
hand is an accomplishment of much importance because we 
often form an immediate judgement of a persons other acquire 
ments from the hand he writes but it is of much more im 
portance to obtain a correct and graceful style of expression 
the one is a manual the other a mental art if we receive 
from any one a letter scarcely legible scrawled rather than 
written we hardly think well of the writers education but 
if the language is ungrammatical and all the sentences con 
fused in short if there appears a total deficiency of skill in 
the art of composition we c 

the following is another example 

it is better to be sensible than witty a witty man 
may raise admiration but he seldom gains love a sensible 
man though perhaps not much listened to at first gains con 
stantly increasing attention till at last he is consulted by all 



sec errors in deductive practice 

and loved by all to be sure it may be a disadvantage to be 
too sensible for instance to be too sensible to reproach or 
ingratitude or neglect but the very quality of being sensible 
will enable the person to surmount this failing and render 
him superior to the injustice of the world 

here there is confusion between sensible in understanding 
and sensibility on account of what others do or say correct 
part of the example thus to be sure a sensible person is 
liable like others to incur unmerited reproach ingratitude 
or neglect but the quality of being sensible will enable 
him to see such dispositions in their true light and render c 

a third example may be added 

 my friend brown was the strongest man i ever knew 
and yet sometimes the most timorous in body and limb 
he was so nervous that he could overcome in wrestling 
men who were twice his weight and yet if he had to pass 
through a churchyard at night his nervousness was such 
that he would shake all over so we see that the strongest 
frame does not protect a man from superstitious fears 

the confusion here is between strong in bodily nerve and 
liable to fears which affect the nerves instead of saying his 
nervousness was such say his timorousness was such 
and the example will be corrected 

 neglecting the means of distinction and divi 
sion which grammar provides for the clear develop 
ment of thought by words 

the means which grammar provides are sentences periodic 
and nonperiodic paragraphs otherwise called sections and 
parts made up of paragraphs or sections all that grammar 
looks to in these is the accuracy of the outward structure 
it is for logic to take care that the structure has its foundation 
in the purposed development of thought so that there shall 
be union where that purpose requires union and distinctness 
where it requires distinction we must not overload a sentence 
or paragraph or higher division of discourse with what cannot be 
readily apprehended as a part of its purpose hence the young 
themewriter fails in the examples given hereunder 

example courage leads us to face danger without 
fear fortitude to bear calamity without complaining and is 
a virtue all ought to possess for being as we all are born 
to trouble afflictions of some kind must fall to our lot

the proper business of the former part of this sentence 
appears to be if clearly settled in the writers intention to 
define fortitude in contradistinction to courage and that pur 
poe iniii completed the sentence should have ended namely 
at the word complaining what follows should be not only 
in a different sentence but should begin a new paragraph 
with the word fortitude repeated as nominative to the verb is 
for it appears that the reasoner having made his way clear 
by defining his subject is about to consider its necessity c 

example the highborn the rich and the beautiful 
are peculiarly exposed to flattery and the sweet incense is 
offered to them in abundance by those whom all good men 
justly abhor for their deceitful servility 

in this sentence the reasoner proposes to show the dangers 
arising from flattery which attend birth wealth and beauty 
and also to show the baseness of flatterers these purposes 
should be enunciated distinctly they should not be attempted 
even in the same paragraph let us sav that the first para 
graph shall confine itself to the former object and begin thus 
 the highborn the rich and the beautiful are peculiarly 
exposed to flattery their favours are eagerly sought by 
multitudes and every stratagem is inplmxd to attain them 
the sweet incense is therefore offered in abundance and is 
eagerly inhaled till the victims intoxicated by the fumes c 
in this strain or something like it let us carry out the former 
of the two purposes the development of thought being as 
to this point sufficiently extended let the development 
the next point have also its appropriate paragraph beginning 
perhaps thus but the flatterer is justly abhorred by ail 
good men for the art he uses is deceit and servility to 
gain his own ends he wears a constant mask and belies the 
real sentiments of his breast he oilers what he knows must 
poison the mind a worse effect than i 

example we may therefore come to these conclusions 
that perfect bliss is not to be found in this life that our 
ielicity consists in the pursuit much more than in the attain 
ment of our wishes and that happiness without alloy is re 
served for another state of being as the most fortunate of 
men when they have reached all they once desired are still in 
f sumithiij to complete their happiness 

if the reasoner had previously stated arguments sufficient

to infer the conclusions the afterthought in italics is out of 
place it is either superfluous or it ought to have been 
brought forward among the previous arguments 

it belongs to rhetoric to bring forward arguments in such 
order and with such outward admonitions of order as may 
best fit them for reception and clear understanding as re 
gards the persons addressed in logic that is the best 
order which the reasoner finds most effectual for the clear 
development of his own knowledge to himself what this 
may be depends upon his habits of thinking some order 
he must have or the development of his knowledge will be 
confused and valueless he must fix points for development 
and each of these being pursued to a satisfactory extent he 
must then bring them all to issue in some one general result 
which during the progress of each he has kept steadily in 
view a reasoner whose exercises in logic are thus conducted 
will when he is required to be a rhetorician find little diffi 
culty in dividing an extensive discourse into parts subordinate 
and principal whatever be the names he chooses to employ 
sections chapters books c or other names or external 
indications of division without formal names he may choose 
to employ to interfere by express directions with this 
liberty of choice would be to curb originality in the conduct 
of thought and to attempt to teach those who have no 
originality would be to show how fields may be divided 
which produce no fruit worthy of division our next general

own knowledge in all cases is the apprehension of rela 
tions but these relations are separately innumerable and 
many of them may in their separate state exist clearly in a 
mind of inferior power or industry to collect them under

following extract from a learners theme in which several 
propositions are required to make the train of thinking clear

on the surface to be picked up by the casual traveller but 
must be sought for with pains and labour books and

 let us further observe that study is as necessary to the mind 
as action is to the body if the limbs were muffled up they

it may be necessary to add that the divisions or para 
graphs require not to be named if the manuscript distin 
guishes them in the usual way and that italics are used 
above only to call attention to the propositions which are 
supplied 

 proposing too much or too little a proposition 
ought not to contain more than the arguments are intended to 
prove since in the mind of the reasoner it is or ought to 
be the conclusion from those arguments suppose for in 
stance that the themewriter intends in one division of his 
exercise on astronomy to dwell upon the sublimity of its 
objects he ought not in that division to say that astro 
nomy is a noble an interesting and a useful science but 
only say that it is sublime noble and interesting yet 
the omission of the word useful would be a fault at the 
commencement of the theme in proposing all the points 
which the reasoner intends to consider since the utility of 
the science it is presumed would be one of the points 

a writer should be careful of even seeming to promise too 
much and therefore in a theme all high sounding transi 
tions or introductions should be avoided suppose for in 
stance that the themewriter after dwelling on the sublimity 
of astronomy were to proceed thus 

 having thus described and illustrated to the best of my 
ability the sublime thoughts and correspondent emotions to 
which the noble science of astronomy gives birth i shall 
now proceed to show that this branch of study is not less 
useful to man than it is sublime and interesting 

this would be a transition of disproportionate length to 
suit a brief theme the writer needs only say but the 



 manual of logic chap v 

study of astronomy is as useful as it is sublime and then 
proceed to show its uses 

 deviation from the proposition this fault occurs 
when the reasoner lays down a proposition which he follows 
up by arguments that do not especially belong to it but to 
some other proposition which embraces both the first propo 
sition and the others his reasoning therefore may not be 
wrong if referred to something in his mind which he leaves 
unexpressed but is irrelevant with regard to the proposition 
with which he starts for example 

 anger has been called a short madness and people of 
the weakest understandings are most subject to it it is 
remarkable that when a disputant is in the wrong he tries to 
make up in violence what he wants in argument this 
arises from his pride he will not own his error and be 
cause he is determined not to be convicted of it he falls into 
a passion 

there may be truth in all that is here said but it is not 
truth to the purpose at least if the commencing proposition 
is meant to indicate the purpose to follow up that pur 
pose the reasoner should have proceeded in the following 
manner or in some manner like the following 

 anger has been called a short madness to be con 
vinced that the appellation is just let us look to the effects 
of anger it disturbs a mans judgement so that he inflicts 
an injury on his dearest friend whom the next moment he 
loads with caresses it makes him run headlong into dangers 
which if his mind were clear he would be the first to see 
and avoid it is true that anger does not always disturb the 
mind to tins degree but that it disturbs the mind to a de 
gree proportionate to its violence is certain and therefore 
it may be justly denominated a madness 

 discoursing short of the proposition this fault 
arises from regarding a subject in some partial point of 
which happens to be familiar to the reasoner instead of re 
garding it in the extent implied by the term or terms pro 
posing it suppose for instance that education is the 
subject proposed to be developed and that the reasoner is a 
young female she would ill suit the arguments to so gene 
ral a subject although she would correctly proceed according 
to her limited experience if she began thus 



sec errors in deductive practice 

 my opinion of education is this that reading writing 
and arithmetic are the groundwork and that english gram 
mar comes next in importance a child ought to begin 
french very early because the pronunciation of that language 
is difficult in maturer years i would also recommend atten 
tion to the accomplishments of dancing drawing and music 
and above all i would not have needlework neglected 

it is evident that such a detail does not meet the subject in 
the universal sense in which it is proposed but how can we 
expect from a reasoner the development of more knowledge 
than experience has provided yet it may be useful to point 
out to such a reasoner that if the subject is proposed in its 
widest sense the arguments should be equally comprehensive 
for instance 

 my opinion of education is this that it is then only 
just when it fits the individual for his duties for this pur 
pose both the mind and the body stand in need of discipline 
the mind must be made acquainted with the duties of life 
and instructed in all science necessary to their performance 
and the body must be formed to whatever habits will most 
effectually conduce to the same end 

all this is applicable whether we speak of a male or a 
female a prince or a peasant a member of civilized society 
or a savage who lives by hunting and fishing and the argu 
ments as to their extent therefore agree with the proposition 
yet a writer is not bound to treat a subject thus generally 
he may choose a special view because he feels competent to 
no other all that is required in such case is a statement 
at the beginning of what he intends a proposition which 
limits the general subject and saves the arguments from the 
charge of irrelevancy thus the female reasoner in the 
example furnished above would have been free from censure 
had she begun thus 

 of education generally i am incompetent to speak i 
can but point out from the experience i have had what i 
think necessary to be taught to young females raised in our 
country above the necessity of manual labour they must 
learn reading writing and arithmetic and english grammar 
comes next in importance a child ought c 

 discoursing wide of the proposition this fault 
arises from an indistinct view of the subject hence the 



 manual of logic chap v 

writer instead of using arguments which agree with the pro 
position and with nothing else employs such as agree with 
some general proposition under which the particular one is 
included he may be compared to a person that shoots 
toward the mark but does not take aim precisely at it 

example prudence is a sure road to reputation they 
who are obedient to their parents and teachers when young 
obtain accomplishments which are of the highest value in 
maturity as they advance in years they fear god honour 
the king and do as they would be done by by this manner 
of conduct they may sometimes miss immediate advantages 
such as shortsighted cunning people would snatch at but 
they gain what is much better the approbation of their own 
hearts and finally the respect and applause of mankind 

these arguments do not belong to prudence in particular 
but to virtue in general and would accordingly be suitable 
to this proposition virtue is the surest road to reputation 
they who are obedient c arguments suitable to the 
other proposition will be such as these 

 prudence is a sure road to reputation a man whose 
abilities are of a common or even of an inferior order but who 
determines cautiously and chooses the proper time for all he 
says and does will advance with certainty though perhaps 
slowly the chief cause of his progress will be the confi 
dence he secures for all feel the value of his advice assist 
ance and agency who knows exactly when to speak and 
when to be silent when to act and when to cease from 
action 

example disappointments are a great part of our 
portion in this life in our infancy we are liable to dreadful 
accidents and must trust entirely to others for safety and pre 
servation as we grow older we think we can take care of 
ourselves and we become confident and presuming but 
almost every day brings with it some greater or less mis 
fortune and thus we are gradually taught not to depend en 
tirely upon ourselves but to put our chief trust in god 

to keep to the point the reasoner should have proceeded 
thus disappointments are a great part of our portion in 
this life the wishes and hopes even of our childhood are as 
frequently checked as gratified but this may seem inevitable 
because we have not yet acquired sufficient experience to 



sec syllogism of formal logic 

form proper expectations as we grow older we think our 
better judgement enables us to calculate less erroneously and 
we become confident c 

an indistinct view of a subject is often betrayed by a 
single expression suppose the themewriter is treating of 
melancholy in urging the duty of not giving way to it he 
should not say we are bound to bear the evils of life with 
patience but with cheerful resignation on the other 
hand if he is treating of fretfulness he ought to argue that 
we are bound to bear the afflictions of life with patience 



chapter vi 
the syllogism of formal logic 

 we deem some account of this syllogism to be expe 
dient not because it can be of the least practical value to our 
student but because the technical language pertaining to it 
has from time immemorial been associated with the pre 
vailing notions of logic and we would not have our student 
quite ignorant of what through the force of habit is wont to 
be thought necessary in a work upon logic and that the 
account given for this purpose may be clearly understood in 
contradistinction to the doctrine held in this manual we shall 
conclude the chapter with a recapitulation of the leading 
principles of our doctrine 

some account of the syllogism of formal logic 

 the syllogism which is worked by extremes and middle 
term is constructed under a persuasion that the act of the in 
tellect by which from two things known we reach a third is 
a voluntary act and that in the deduction of our knowledge 
real or assumed we can with relation to this knowledge 
come to wrong conclusions as in the induction of it we 
can wrongly apply what we know to interpret what we do 
not yet know in other words can make wrong inferences 
the persuasion is completely erroneous but it is one into 
which we almost inevitably fall if we embrace the ordinary 
or vulgar notion of the way in which language is the exponent 
of thought the syllogism of aristotle is built upon the 
common notion let us then see what this notion is 



 manual of logic chapvj 

 the vulgar notion of thought expressed by language is 
that the one represents the other with a perfect correspondence 
of part to part and a correspondence of operations in joining 
the parts acting on this notion we shall when we desire to 
ascertain what exists or what is going on within the mind 
examine what exists outwardly and how we operate with 
avluit so exists proceeding upon this principle altogether a 
false one we shall in the first place arrive at ideas as the 
presumed mental originals of single words and at an appro 
priate faculty of the mind by which these ideas primarily 
received into the mind from the things of sense are revived 
by words which faculty is called simple apprehension but 
words without being formed into sentences can be joined by 
fvitiin grammatical particles and we must again look into 
the mind for the correspondent originals hence the division 
of apprehension into complex and incompkx the latter being the 
apprehension of ideas signified by single words the former by 
words united so as not to be sentences the next operation of 
language is the joining of words into sentences this is done 
by verbs but verbs are many while the effect of a verb is 
always the same we have therefore to find a verb which 
shall produce this common effect without embarrassing the 
outward operation with more than it produces such a verb 
is found in what is called the copula is this verb placed 
between the signs of two ideas is supposed to indicate another 
operation of the mind called judgement for admitting that 
the one idea agrees with the other the judgement pronounces 
that they do agree and the verb is presents itself as the sign 
of that verdict but they may not agree and we have fur 
ther to find in the outward operation a sign correspondent 
to the opposite determination of the judgement which if 
found we are to take as an evidence of a correspondent mental 
act the sign required is found in the grammatical term not 
or h advancing now from words formed into sentences to 
sentences formed into discourse we have again to ascertain 
from the outward act the presumed correspondent mental 
operation why should propositions which the judgement 
pronounces to be true because it has compared the ideas in 
each and affirmed or denied that they agree why should 
these necessitate another proposition which is true because the 
others are true this is the problem which the syllogism 



sec syllogism of formal logic 

undertakes to solve and in taking up this problem we enter 
upon a third operation of the mind called reasoning 

 to solve this problem in the aristotelian way we must 
suppose that in innumerable cases the judgement is unable 
to pronounce of two ideas either that they agree or disagree 
in this difficulty the reason comes forward and provides a 
third idea by which to measure these two what really does 
take place in every act of the intellect here comes in to give 
plausibility to the aristotelian doctrine namely the occur 
rence of premises which are always two and the inevitable 
intellection from them but in the doctrine of the syllogism 
this is proposed to be accounted for not as an inevitable but 
a voluntary act we have to prove that two ideas agree or 
disagree when the judgement cannot pronounce that they do 
so and as abovesaid reason is supposed to provide us with 
a third idea with this idea each of the two ideas is mea 
sured and if each idea agrees with the third then reason de 
termines that they agree with each other but if either of them 
disagrees with the third idea then it determines that the two 
disagree the mental process here described if manifested 
with accurate correspondence outwardly requires three pro 
positions two in which the ideas whose agreement or dis 
agreement is sought to be proved are severally measured with 
the idea signified by the middle term and one in which 
consequently upon the twofold comparison the two extremes 
as they are called receive from this reasoning process the 
judgement of agreement or disagreement it is of course 
admitted by the aristotelians that sentences united into dis 

 the doctrine of the aristotelian syllogism has the effect of the jug 
glers art who talks to his audience of something which he seems to be 
doing yet is not doing in order to call off their attention from his real 
proceeding the difference is that the ordinary juggler does not deceive 
himself and the aristotelian does dugald stewart indeed intimates that 
the prime juggler knew what he was about but this is hardly credible 
and with regard to his followers nothing can be more conscientious than 
their belief in the truth of what they teach see for instance dr 
whately passim the fact is that they feel the true ground of the syl 
logism even while describing the false one and so capital is the trick 
that locke and others though they see it must be a trick are not able to 
describe how it is done locke merely says with characteristic simplicity 
and plain english sense god hath not been so sparing to men to make 
them barely twolegged creatures and left it to aristotle to make them 
rational he hath been more bountiful to mankind than so 



 manual of logic chap vi 

course do not always appear in the forms of syllogism but 
it is insisted upon that their syllogism namely the syllogism 
which works by extremes and middle term lies concealed 
under every operation of language transcending the repre 
sentation of ideas by single terms the representation of ideas 
by terms joined by particles not being verbs and the junction 
of terms by means of a verb into a sentence which last 
mentioned fact yields what they call a proposition in outward 
form and a judgement when spoken of as the correspondent 
operation in the mind but this is not the whole of the 
matter the doctrine thus briefly described carries with it 
much other doctrine both in the preliminary stages and in the 
syllogism which results from them first for ideas we have 
the doctrine of the categories or predicaments which are ten 
in number substance quantity quality relation place 
time situation possession action suffering these are pre 
sumed to contain as summa genera all our ideas in other 
words all the subjectmatter of judgement and predication 
passing to the next stage that is to the operations of the 
judgement upon these materials we have a division into 
subject and predicate the term expressing an idea concerning 
which a judgement is to take place being called a subject 
the term expressing the idea affirmed or denied to agree with 
it being called a predicate hence ideas and their cor 
respondent terms when they are to be predicated are called 
predicables and the doctrine is that they can be predicated 
as genus or as species or as difference or as a property or as 
an accident thus animal which belongs to the category 
substance can be predicated as genus of the subject man 
also belonging to the category substance thus rational 
belonging to the category quality can also as a difference be 
predicated of the subject man thus again rational animal 
now again belonging to the category substance can be pre 
dicated as his species of the subject man the difference and 
the added genus making up the species thus once more 
nubility which belongs to the category quality can be pre 
dicated as a property of the subject man and thus lastly 
being young or old tall or short rich or poor digging in his 
garden or asleep in his bed and so forth can be predicated as 
an accident of the subject man such doctrine under the first 
and second of the assumed three operations of the mind fur 



sec syllogism of formal logic 

nishes the ground for constructing the formal syllogism by 
which as already said when the judgement cannot pronounce 
on the agreement or disagreement of two ideas it is proposed 
to demonstrate their agreement through the instrumentality of 
a third idea to a demonstration an axiom is necessary and 
the axiom of the formal syllogism is the dictum de omni et 
nullo whose purport is that whatever is affirmed or denied of 
all the members of a doss may be affirmed or denied of every 
member of it where be it observed the word all is required 
to be understood distributively and not collectively so that a 
less equivocal statement of the axiom is this whatever is 
affirmed or denied of every member of a class is affirmed or de 
nied of every member of it as pure an axiom no doubt as 
another often referred to namely whatever is is in our 
logic we call this an identical proposition and consider it to 
be verbiage but let us accept them both as axioms and 
pass on to other doctrine necessary to the construction of the 
formal syllogism the terms expressing the ideas whose 
agreement or disagreement is to be demonstrated are to be 
received under the names of minor and of major term the 
former being the subject the other the predicate as for 
instance in saying kings are mortal kings is the minor and 
mortal the major term then we have a difference of pro 
positions with regard to their quality and to their quantity 
a proposition which affirms the agreement of the two ideas 
being said to differ in quality from one which denies their 
agreement and a proposition which affirms or denies uni 
versally of a class of things being said to differ in quantity 
and this is of course a difference mour logic also from one 
which affirms or denies only concerning some of a class for 
instance it is one thing to say all your servants are 
rogues and another to say some of them are rogues or 
 some one is a rogue another necessary doctrine towards 
the construction of the formal syllogism is that of the distri 
bution or nondistribution of terms the purport of this may 
be indicated by an example if we say that every mare is 
ahorse it does not follow that every horse is a mare 
but if we say that no goose is a swan it does follow that 
no swan is a goose accordingly it is one of the prin 
ciples in the doctrine of the formal syllogism that the minor 
term of an affirmative proposition is distributed that is it in 

g 



 manual of logic chap vi 

eludes all that it can be applied to while the major term is 
undistributed that is it does not include all the things it can 
be applied to as for instance in saying every mar 
horse the term horse understood only of those horses that 
are mares does not include all that the term horse can be 
applied to but with regard to a negative proposition both 
the major and the minor terms are distributed and now 
with the apparatus of the syllogism and its doctrine in hand 
 t us proceed with the demonstration it proposes when w 
have to show on the principles of the science that two ideas 
agree or disagree we must hunt among the categories for a 
suitable third or middle term with which to compare first tin 
major and then the minor term the proposition arising out 
of the comparison of the middle with the major term is then 
called the major premise and that arising out of the com 
parison of the middle with the minor term is called the minor 
premise if in these two acts of comparison the judgement 
determines an agreement between the major term and the 
middle and again between the minor term and the middle 
then reason comes in and affirms in what is called the con 
clusion the agreement which was to be demonstrate i i 
the terms that have been thus measured with tin middle 
term but if tin judgement determines in its two acts of 
comparison that either the major or the minor term does not 
agree with the middle term then reason determines in the 
conclusion what as an alternative was to be demonstrated 
namely the disagreement of the terms that have been mea 
sured with the middle term in other words that the major 
of the conclusion must be predicated negatively of the minor 
but the conclusion arrived at through this process cannot 
after all be depended upon except under the safeguard of 
laws growing out of the doctrine of the quality and quant ity 
of propositions and the distribution or nondistribution of 
terms thus for instance we are required to distribute the 
middle term once at least in the premises a failure in which 
is called an undistributed middle thus also we are required 
to distribute the major or the minor term in the premises if wl 
propose to distribute it in the conclusion a failure in which 
is called an illicit process of the major or of the minor either 
of which failures vitiates the demonstration prepared in this 
manner to distinguish between a legitimate and an illegitimate 



sec syllogism of formal logic 

syllogism we come next to consider in how many ways three 
propositions can be constructed out of extremes that is out of 
the minor and major terms which are to form a conclusion 
when we reach it and the middle term by which we propose to 
reach it now disregarding the laws concerning the quality 
and quantity of propositions which laws determine what 
forms are to be accepted as legitimate syllogisms and what 
are not we have no fewer than of these triads of pro 
positions out of which only by virtue of the laws 
referred to will be legitimate syllogisms that is syllogisms 
which the dictum of aristotle referred to as their axiom will 
be found to warrant to make this understood by our 
scholar the technical expedients in the doctrine of the formal 
syllogism depending on the quality and quantity of pro 
positions and the relative situation of the three terms in the 
premises of a syllogism must be further explained 

 propositions in the doctrine of formal logic are of four 
kinds universal affirmative signified by the letter a as 
 every man is mortal every mare is a horse universal 
negative signified by the letter e as no man is sinless 
 no goose is a swan particular affirmative signified by the 
letter i as some men are rogues particular negative sig 
nified by the letter o as some men are not rogues these 
varieties of quality and quantity in the propositions produce 
when the propositions are formed into syllogisms what are 
called the different moods of the syllogisms now the four sym 
bols a e i o and consequently the sorts of propositions that 
answer to them can be varied by threes in ways so that 
we have triads of propositions without any change of the 
relative situation of major minor and middle terms in each 
triad which situation is this that the middle term is sub 
jected in the major premise and predicated in the minor one 
and of course the minor term by its name see the previous 
section is the subject of the conclusion as the major term is 
its predicate when in forming a syllogism the three terms 
are thus disposed relatively to each other the syllogism is 
said to be in the first figure there are three other figures 
in what is called the secand figure the middle term is pre 
dicated in both premises in what is called the third figure 
it is subjected in both premises in what is called the fourth 
figure it is predicated in the major premise and subjected in 

g 



 manual of logic vi 

the minor and as in the first figure we can have triads 
of propositions making up apparent syllogisms of so many 
chilirent moods we can in all the figures have four times 
that is as already stated but the laws of the syll 
exclude in the first figure all but four moods a a a e a k 
all and e i o in the second figure all but four e a e 
a k e i o and a o o in the third figure all but six 
aai i a i all eao oao and eio 
arid in the fourth figure all but five a a i aee i a i 
k a and k i o thus leaving as above stated out of 
jm onlv l i forms which are legitimate syllogisms that is 
which at lord the demonstration proposed by the science 

i in order that tin nineteen legitimate forms of syll 
may be remembered by appropriate names the symbolic 
leiirs of ach are formed with consonants into words thr 
wisi meaningless and the words are put together so as to 
exhibit the following imitation of latin verse

sec principles opposed to foemal logic 

remarked before leaving this account of the formal syllogism 
that a syllogism in any of the last three figures can under the 
safeguard of certain rules be converted into a syllogism of the 
first which is deemed the only perfect figure for instance 
the syllogism in the fourth figure exemplified in the third note 
below can be converted into ferio as thoughtful men are 
not fools some men are thoughtful therefore some men 
are not fools the fourth figure does not appear in aris 
totle but was added by his followers 

recapitulation of the leading principles in this manual of 
logic as opposed to the principles on which as explained 
in the foregoing account the syllogism of formal iogic is 
based 

 in our logic we presume not to inquire much less to 
demonstrate how or why an intellection takes place we 
esteem it a fact which can no more be accounted for than the 
fact of a sensation though we estimate these facts as things 
in their nature different we deem for instance that a sen 
sation is one thing and that the knowledge of a sensation the 
result of intellection is another 

 we deny that in using words for logical purposes 
three operations of the mind are concerned we affirm that 
the operation is always the same however it may be signified 
outwardly that is whether by single terms or by complex 
terms or by propositions or by propositions united into forms 
of greater extent and complexity we affirm in short that 
the difference between terms and proposition and syllogism 
is a mere grammatical difference having no foundation in any 
correspondent original processes of the mind but being means 
sometimes convenient in one shape sometimes in another for 
fixing or for developing the knowledge we have acquired or 
for presenting it to another mind for in our doctrine a single 
term quite as much as a proposition and quite as much as 
a syllogism is an indication of knowledge arising out of 
premises thus red expresses our knowledge of a colour 
which knowledge is the fact of our being aware of one sen 
sation relatively to others of its kind that is to say we know 
what is red because we know what it is not to be red nor 
could we know the one unless at the same time we knew 



 manual of logic chap vi 

the other that of which we have knowledge and that by 
which we know it are the premises the consequent know 
led is the conclusion expressed by this term in a pro 
position there is the same fact with this only difference 
that the premises are indicated as well as the resulting know 
ledge though not indicated so distinctly as by the syllogism 
in this last the two premises and the conclusion are stated 
in so many sentences of independent grammatical construction 
and the syllogism is therefore the most explicit form in which 
we can lay down what at any moment we know 

 but in speaking thus of the svll r ism we do not mean 
the syllogism which operates by extremes and middle term 
under the doctrine of allirmation and negation with us 
affirmation and negation belong to grammar not to logic 
no man and every man are equally signs of positive know 
ledge in the one case arising out of the premises no and man 
in the other out of the premises every and man the same 
may he said of the know led expressed by isnot it is positive 
knowledge quite as much as that expressed by is in all 

the resulting expression is one expression with one 
moaning such is the datum of our syllogism such the 
related argument but the are no sooner expressed than 
the conclusion unites tin in and makes thorn one so that now 
the whole syllogism is on n with one meaning an 

expression of the knnwlf loped just as a 

single term is such an expression just as a complex term is 
such an oxpression just as a proposition is such an 

 with regard to the categories the gkxkkal hi ads of 
all we know they seem at present to have lost their reputation 
even with the aristotelians themselves we may indeed 
iairly ask why they are so many or why they are not more 
as to one of them relation we affirm this to be included 
in all the others a substance whatever it be is known 
because we are aware of its relation to other substances so 
of a quality so of each of the other heads wo ask also 
as to these general heads or the special heads under them or 
the singulars under these what is meant by calling them 
ideas if by ideas is meant the knoidedge which they signify 

 the catalogue certainly is but a very crude one whatelys 
logic book iv eh ii a foot note 



sec principles opposed to formal logic 

our only objection to the word is that custom has rendered it 
for this meaning a vague and indistinct expression if other 
is meant than knowledge of the things to which the term can 
be applied we object to its application in this way till it can 
be shown what it is that words can signify other than things 
real things ideal both of which come under the common 
term of things physical and things metaphysical the 
words in all three cases being immediately significant of know 
ledge which in its nature is distinct from the things com 
prehended by it that is to say words are in all cases 
immediately significant of what is metaphysical but can next 
be applied as names to things real or to things ideal or to 
things which are neither the one nor the other but are the 
relations under which those things suggest themselves to the 
human understanding which relations we have the power to 
entertain apart from the things 

 the science of the formal syllogism proposes a demon 
stration of its conclusions our doctrine is that we cannot 
come to a false conclusion in deductive reasoning except by 
depending on the forms which that syllogism provides and 
then neglecting its rules the science then is necessary only 
to those who use its forms to propose it for others is to 
propose spectacles for people who without them cannot but 
see clearly or crutches for people who without them cannot 
but walk well the use of the syllogism in our logic is 
not to test the validity of conclusions but to spread out our 
premises that so we may be induced to consider on what 
grounds we have assumed them in a word our logic leads 
us always back to what we have acquired or what we 
presume we have acquired in order that if our knowledge 
is not sound we may supply its deficiencies or set it altogether 
aside

outline of an introductory course of instruction 
in logic 

for pupils not yet comiki km to enter ox the study 
of the whole work 



in order to feel what he can and what he cannot accomplish 
in developing his knowledge the learner should at once be 
set to themewriting all the instructions immediately re 
quired for this purpose will be found between section 
chapter iv and section chapter v both sections inclu 
sive pages this having been diligently read and 
well considered let a subject be chosen either from among 
those suggested or from such as may occur in reading or in 
conversation say that curiosity is the subject chnsvn it 
is most likely that his iirst thoughts will perplex and confuse 
him he will be disposed to consider curiositv only as a 
mischief an impertinence a meanness because his attention 
has been most frequently called to these effects and yet he 
will suspect that some higher point of view should le taken 
which may discover the good as well as the bad env 
curiositv a definition will here be needed curiosity or 
eagerness of search after knowledge is what let him 
reflect for a time and he cannot fail to add something to the 
following purpose either a good or an evil according to 
the purposes to which it is applied the subject thus 
 tranches into two and his subsequent development will bring 
forth what his experience and reading make him know rirt 
of welldirected curiosity and then of curiosity idly and im 
pertinently directed 

it is not always necessary to begin by a definition if the 
name of the subject is at once suggestive of all that it includes 

 we are here supposing the pupil to have passed through the exercises 
pertaining to grammar and to rhetoric 



course for early learners 

it will be best to begin not by a definition but by some very 
general proposition in treating of industry for instance it 
would be an obvious thing to say that it is the source of 
all the blessings of life having stated this general fact 
which is to be developed by particulars it is very likely that 
the young thinker will find himself lost amid the multitude 
that crowd into his mind he is conscious that it will not 
do to note them down in heterogeneous order just as the 
happen to occur as in making out a catalogue how then 
must he proceed he must adopt sojaie general heads 
standing as it were midway between the first general state 
merit and the infinite particulars which still lie beneath 
for instance he might go on to say first let us see what 
industry does for the poor man and having developed his 
knowledge under this head the following might be another 
 next let us see what industry does for the young and 
consequently ignorant person other heads might be the 
effects of industry on sterile land or on land partially covered 
by sea on the people of a whole country on the arts which 
refine a people and on the sciences which improve those 
arts his mode of developing this subject would be a guide 
in developing the opposite cm sloth of which subject the 
following is an outline for his guidance and to it are added 
a few other outlines after filling up which it is hoped that 
further assistance of the same kind may be discontinued 

ox sloth it is the root of all evil what condition 
it brings even a rich man to what it prevents in the 
young what will be the character and condition of a 
once flourishing farm after years of neglect by a slothful 
owner what effect sloth produces or is likely to produce 
on a whole people what effect it has upon the bodily 
health what effect on the mind and morals 

on enthusiasm ardour of mind engendered by some 
 thing that affects the imagination may be an evil may be 
a good an evil whenever it operates against reason 
tor instance in certain enterprises in the religious temper of 
the mind in the reception of new opinions a good 
when it is controlled by reason for instance in our enter 
prises in our religious feelings in our opinions it ministers 
to excellence in the fine arts it confers the capacity for appre 
ciating and enjoying them

sonal endowment or other lfitt of providence for every 
thing is valuable in proportion to the happiness it secures

nay hour by hour watch and control c 

on iimiinkss u tin rent olject of all our actions 
the ways are different this man imagines it is to be found 
in c another ift c a third in c some suppose 
c others c but though the wavs are thus different the 
end is ever the same namely c the greater number 
of these supposed ways must be wrong for the greater 
number of those who follow them confess that in their s 
pursuits they never reach their object happiness 
in the iiiind and only to a certain extent is it dependent on 
external circumstances what the circumstances are both 
external and internal on which happiness depends 

on liberty a subject that seldom fails to raise our 
wannest emotions we think of the heroes of greece and 
of rome of switzerland and of britain say who they were 
and what they attempted our love of liberty is ji 
by the evils that attend a star f slavery levelp these evils 
 hut liberty must not be confounded with licentiou 
shew that wherever there is real liberty there is sul 
to authority which controls the evilintentioned and protects 
the good 

on selfknowledge all moral improvement depends 
upon it if we know not our defects we cannot j 
what are the hindrances to selfknowledge what will 
follow in proportion as we improve in it 

on sklfdkxial consists in abstaining from some 
present gratification for the sake of greater expected good is 
the teat principle of religion and of morals of religion for 
all the rewards which she imlds out are promised on the con 
dition c of morals for all the virtues imply that we resist 
c selfdenial is necessary in a certain degree to real 
enjoyment for c 

on obedience our progress in virtue in knowledge and 
in happiness depends upon it first in virtue for we must 
conform to the laws c secondly in knowledge be

cause we learn from others either by teachers who commu 
nicate through the ear or by books which communicate 
through the eye and if c thirdly in happiness be 
cause we are prone to evil courses in other words to courses 
that end in misery from which we can be preserved only c 

on adversity to creatures whose present existence is 
a state of trial is calculated to be an ultimate good first by 
opening the heart to fellow feeling with the woes of others 
 secondly by correcting vices engendered by prosperity 
namely c thirdly by qualifying us to enjoy what is 
good when the good returns for he who knows not c 
cannot truly know and enjoy c 

on habit is second nature whatever is possible to 
be done however difficult at first is made easy by repeated 
trials in other words by acquiring the habit examples from 
the arts if it forms our practice in the mechanic and the 
ornamental arts it has equal power in forming all our practice 
hence our conduct in life will be dependent c however 
much we may wish to be good yet if our habits c on 
the other hand our temptations to evil will be less strong if 
our habits c 

on order is of the utmost importance in all the 
concerns of life it conduces to comfort in a household for 
c it is the source of internal prosperity and external 
strength in a nation for c it is necessary in our 
studies because in all things to be learned there is subordi 
nation of one part of knowledge to another and if c 
it forms the virtues for each virtue has its bounds as for 
instance c

opportunity for accomplishing the great ends of his existence 
these are happiness here and immortality hereafter to 
secure happiness here we must c to secure happiness 
hereafter we must so rule our present conduct as c 
the short period of the longest life calls upon us c 

on prejudice is the habit or act of thinking and 
speaking as if we had certain knowledge when the subjects 
are such or so circumstanced that we know either nothing 
about them or very little all persons are liable to pre 
judices sometimes erring by being favourable sometimes by 
being unfavourable for instance when we see any one for

the first time c so when we visit foreign countries and 
see manners and customs different from our own 
tinue with other instances but though all persons are 
liable to prejudices all persons are not governed them 
it is in this n spirt that people differ and they differ great iv 
one man is unconscious of his prejudices and accordingly 
c another man is quite aware of the different character 
of his certain and uncertain knowledge and therefore takes 
care c 

on truth see in the index if we speak of truth 
undt three points of view we may distinguish it as moral 
scientific and divine moral truth is opposed to falsehood 
it is the conformity of our won is and actions to our thoughts 
thus we are said to speak the truth when c in such a 
case what we say may not be scientific truth yet if c 
 scientific truth is that which we reach by study and ex 
periment its amount will consequently be different at dif 
ferent periods of ones life and at different periods of the 
world exemplify each observation divine truth is 
that which belongs to the deity portions only of which he 
reveals to his creatures where do we find such revelation 

on youth it is that part of life which presents the 
greatest number of enjoyments the most important opportu 
nities the dangers most to be apprehended the 
ments the opportunities the dangers 

on age though a state which we may not all attain 
is one for which throughout the previous parts of lit 
should all make preparation the nature of this preparation 
that so old age if we reach it may be happy the 
blessings of age when the proper preparation has been made 

on solitude is a state not meant for man v 
an occasional state indispensable to the formation of some of 
the best qualities of our nature its likely effects on the un 
derstanding and thence on the heart the unreasonable 
ness of devoting life wholly to solitude 

on society the nature of man is such as to demand 
society both for the development of his powers and for pro 
viding his true means of happiness prove these points 
 how we may fail of these effects though always in society 

ox geography define it it must have begun 
by the knowledge of small tracts of the earths surface 



course for early learners 

show in what way the knowledge must have increased 
travellers commerce inventions its use in accompany 
ing the study of history 

on astronomy define it the shepherds of 
chaldea are the first recorded astronomers keeping watch 
over their flocks by night under a clear sky they c 
 what was the ptolemaic system and what is that which 
now has its place the kind of emotions which astrono 
mical inquiries produce the practical benefits which the 
science yields 

on agriculture one of the two primeval occupa 
tions of mankind explain the fact all wise nations 
have held and still hold the cultivators of the land in high 
respect give proofs 

on commerce its necessity to the wellbeing and 
improvement of our race its simplest state indications 
from history of its early existence the states that in 
modem times have successively flourished by means of 
commerce 

on morals and manners these are not the same 
though they are understood to imply each other and though 
to be perfect they must go together that they are not the 
same is proved by the facts which we often witness of a 
man sterling in morals without the recommendation of man 
ners and of one of superficially agreeable manners con 
cealing the most corrupt morals explain the regret which 
accompanies our observation of either fact the union of 
morals and manners necessary to the perfection of both there 
must be something deficient in morals themselves if manners 
are wanting and manners must often betray their flimsy 
character if they do not rest on morals 

on religion and superstition light and darkness 
are not more different than c and yet c religion is 
the friend of man superstition c religion is clearsighted 
considerate compassionate superstition c religion is 
full of hope and rational though humble confidence super 
stition c the deficiencies through which superstition 
gets possession of the mind explained by the kind of persons 
in whom it is found and the places where it most prevails 
 the kind of persons in whom genuine religious feelings are 
observed and the places where genuine religion is found

know but the form of thought under which we are supposed 
to include certain things which we know

correlative terms are correlative which imply each other as father 
which implies son or daughter and sow which implies father and 
mother so likewise king and subject master and servant cause and 
effect antecedent and consequent are correlatives but note that the 
principle which such words make peculiarly and strikingly evident is 
universally operative we could not have the knowledge included in 
any word whatever if we had not other knowledge which the word 
implies though it does not directly express it thus we could not 
know what a man is if we did not know what is not a man and so 
with all things whatever

fancy this is often used as a term synonymous with imagination but 
the best custom seems to warrant this difference imagination implies 
emotion as causing the presence of the conceptions their character 
combination and sequence see imagination fancy implies con 
ceptions formed and continued voluntarily that is by choice and with 
out emotion fancy therefore is the origin of the conceits as they are 
called by which the school of poetry is distinguished which was pre 
valent in italy at a certain period and in our own country during the 
period which intervened between the romantic school that closed about 
the end of elizabeths reign and the classical school that opened after 
the restoration the poets of that intervening school are called the 
metaphysical poets even milton is often guilty of these conceits 
thus in a sonnet which begins very naturally by saying that shakspeare 
needs not a stone monument he goes on with the conceit that since we 
are all astonished by his genius that is turned into stone we are all 
stone monuments to record his excellence and in this manner hea 
cifully makes out that any other monument is rendered unnecessary

resting on a foundation universally admitted to be true the merit of 
having turned inquiry concerning its nature and purpose from the false 
direction into which aristotle and his followers had led mankind must 
be conceded after bacon to john locke and to home tooke yet 
both these men in following out the wellconceived purpose of their 
respective inquiries fell into egregious errors lockes purpose was 
to inquire into the origin of human knowledge this he pursues with 
too little regard to the moulding influence of language and his distinc 
tion of ideas into simple and complex and these last into modes 
substances and relations are scarcely more than distinctions without 
a difference on the other hand tooke attributes everything to lan 
guage he is a decided sensationalist who admitting lockes founda 
tion that our knowledge begins with sensation admits nothing except 
language which is more than sensation and while he argues justly 
against lockes doctrine of complex ideas sees nothing beyond the 
instrumentality of language in all beyond sensation he hence con 
cludes that nouns are the primary elements of language and that verbs 
arose from nouns by the addition of something which his treatise 
diversions of purley leaves unexplained home tooke was 
obliged to leave his speculation thus unfinished he had begun well 
but he had taken a wrong turning a course continued in the true 
direction would have led him to the fact that verbs are the primary lan 
guage of our race are the speeches out of which nouns are artificially 
evolved

shut up as they assumed it to be like a light in a dark lantern how 
did it become acquainted with the things out of the body it was

out of the body in order to take cognizance of the things of

consequently that it did not perceive the things of sense at all but only 
the species images or ideas of them this was explained by assum 
ing that all mattrial things dispersed from themselves filmy or shadowy 
representations which being received by the senses were by them 
transmitted to the mind which treasured them up and that with re

petitio principii various forms of this logical error 
philosophy philosophers these are connected with logic because if 
philosophers go astray there must be something wrong in their means 
or purpose while trying to come at the wisdom which they profess to 
love but in a manual of logic an examination of past and present 
philosophy with a view to test by its rules what is sound or what 
is unsound in means or purpose will at once appear an impossible 
undertaking in place of such an examination where it would properly 
come in the body of a larger book it is proposed in this index to fur 
nish nearly in chronological order the names of certain leaders of 
sects especially those of greece accompanied by slight notices of 
the perpetual opposition of opinion by which the sects were multiplied 
and kept distinct 

thales the earliest grecian philosopher of distinguished name 
is supposed to have flourished nearly seven centuries before the 
christian era he was a native of miletus in lonia and because 
anaximander anaximenes diogenes of apollonia who must be 
distinguished from diogenes the cynic and archelaus were either 
taught by him or were also natives of ionia they are all included 
in what is called the lonian or lonic school although they did not 
all profess the same speculative opinions in this they coincided that 
the universe springs from some one material but whether from 
water as thales taught or from air as others insisted whether it 
was palpable and finite or imperceptible and infinite they were not 



pythagoras a native of the isle of samos not far from ionia 
is supposed to have flourished a little less than six centuries before 
the christian era though some make him contemporary with thales 
he taught that number was the essence and principle of all things 
deemed the souls of men to be emanations of the divine substance 
and joined to this doctrine that of the transmigration of souls he 
founded his school at crotona in italy and hence it is called the 
italian though sometimes the doric school 

xenophanes of colophon contemporaneously with pythagoras 
also founded in italy namely at the town of elea a school hence 
called the eleatic which changed the emanative system of the 



 inhkx 

italian school for the doctrine of one eternal infinite being identical 
with the universe a doctrine now called pantheism the other 
most eminent men of this sect were iarmenides and zn the 
date of this last philosopher who must he uftfagirfihed rnm 
the founder of the stoics is about four centuries and a half before 
the christian era 

heraclitus of ephesus also flourished as is supposed about 
four centuries and a half before the christian era though he pro 
perly belongs to the italian school yet he so far thought for himself 
as in general to be distinguished individually he deemed the one 
pervading principle of the universe to be fire but not the elemental 
fire or flame for this he held to be the excess of fire it is accord 
ing to him a warm dry vapour and this is the same as vital energy 
or the soul 

leucippus the disciple of zeno the eleatic see above and the 
teacher of democritus was the founder of what is sometimes termed 
the lower eleatic school he discarded the tranxindpntal universe 
of the elder eleatics and placed the foundation of his theory in the 
world of the senses he is regarded as the original propounder of 
the atomic doctrine afterwards taken up by the epicure ans de 
mocritus was his disciple with some degree of dissent from his 
master by a less exclusive adherence to what we at present call 
sensational philosophy democritus has been called the laughing 
philosopher because he inculcated heeifulness as the main end of 
our pursuits while the melancholy heraclitus is often spoken of as 
the crying philosopher protagoras was the disciple of democritus 
and made himself remarkable by his maxim that man is the measure 
of all things 

socrates the philosopher rather of practical morals than of 
speculative opinions which propose to include morals in wider doc 
trines was born at athens bc and put to death bc 
laying aside the problems onnvrnini the origin and nature of the 
universe and how and why man exists as a part of it the object of 
his instruction was to make men good as the only way to make 
them happy as to his mode of teaching see socratic in this index 
a host of disciples succeeded but some exaggerated and some cor 
rupted his doctrines cebes indeed in his picture of human life 
conveys the doctrine of his master with beauty and truth although 
there is a slight colouring borrowed from pythagoras xenophon 
acted up to his masters principles and in that way demonstrated 
their value diogenes the founder of the cynics men who lived 
like dogs and snarled like them exaggerated his tenets and his 
manners to another of his disciples we must give a distinct place 
namely to 

plato the immortal sae who bears this name was born at 
athens bc and died iu lie is the founder of the aca 
demic school an epithet derived from the grove of academus in 
which he lectured instructed in all philosophy that preceded him 
he taught what best harmonized with his own capacious and com 
prehensive mind his leading doctrine is the independence of god 
 spirit and matter as the two distinct eternal principles by which

all things exist the one operating formatively on the other but not 
creatively our impressions of outward objects are the produce of 
ideas and matter the ideas of the human soul being copies of ex 
emplars that reside in the divine mind and these divine exemplars 
are more and more remembered by man the more he sees of their 
imperfect copies without hence the striving of the welltaught 
soul to reach perfection see at plato in this index references to 
allusions in the manual 

aristotle who was born at stagira in mesopotamia bc 
and died was for twenty years the disciple of plato but he at 
length divided from his master and became the head of the peripa 
tetics who were so called from the place in the lyceum where they 
walked and discoursed among the points on which aristotle differed 
from his master one was his theory of ideas aristotle taught that 
ideas are the phantasms of things and not the eternal intellectual 
types which in platos doctrine give form to the things of sense 
see at aristotle in this index references to parts in the manual 
where his logic is considered see also scholastic schoolmen 

zeno who must be distinguished from zeno the eleatic see 
above was the disciple of polemo an academic but he divided 
from his school and became the founder of the stoic philosophy 
he was born in cyprus in some year between and bc and 
died in some year between and bc he taught at athens 
in a place called the porch or portico stoa whence the name of 
the sect to him must be attributed a sound division of all learning 
into physics ethics and what may be called semeiotics which latter 
department includes the trivium grammar logic and rhetoric 
it was for its ethics that the stoical philosophy was remarkable a 
wise man it taught is unmoved by joy grief or other passion 
esteeming all things as governed by an unavoidable necessity in 
physics it taught that the universe consists of cause and of matter 
death is the separation of the soul and body but they are both mate 
rial and the former though it continues after death is perishable 
the soul of all things is indeed imperishable and of that soul all 
that has life is part among the great men that in subsequent 
times were of this sect may be mentioned cato of utica ob 
bc seneca the roman tragic poet ob ad marcus aure 
lius the emperor ob ad and epictetus the phrygian the 
time of whose death is uncertain but he is known to have lived into 
the times of the lastmentioned emperor 

epicurus taught at athens while that city was thronged with 
academics cynics peripatetics and stoics in all the vigour of 
recent institution he died bc his philosophy contrasts in 
morals most strongly with that of the stoics he made the senses 
the test of truth and prudence the chief of virtues because it re 
strains the appetite for pleasure only so far as indulgence would be 
hurtful to it he maintained the atomic philosophy in physics or 
that which attributes the universe to the confluence of atoms that 
being endued with gravity and motion formed all the things of sense 
without the aid of a supreme intelligent power

themselves in opposition to the stojrs uil srptkism was the effect 
or the practice of controverting whatever was attempted to be taught 
as truth in fact the aim of the sceptical philosophy was to main 
tain the incomprehensibility of all subjects and their art was the 
ability to speak with equal plausibility on both sides of every 
question the school is called the new academy which further 
divided into the second third and fourth academy 

in passing from philosophy and philosophers of ancient days to 
those of comparatively modern times it will scarcely be fitting in this 
manual to mention much more than the names of some philosoj

middle of the sixteenth to the beginning of the seventeenth century 
opposed their own ways of thinking on the universe the deity and 
the destinies of man to the prevalent religious doctrines the latter 
two met the then fate of heretics a fate which entitles them to a 
respect which their opinions would scarcely claim since these were 
nothing more than revivals or mixtures or modifications of the doc

from what source is unknown the philosophy of aristotle though at 
first opposed it was soon adopted by churchmen as a scientific basis of 
the doctrines they taught and it continued to be mixed with divinity and 
all other learning during full five centuries in which time however we 
may trace certain eras and changes a new era commenced with the rise 
of the nominalists see nominalist under john roscelin a frenchman 
who flourished in the twelfth century the celebrated abelard was his 
disciple the third period saw the introduction into europe of the 
writings of the arabian philosophers the translation of aristotle from 
different versions into latin his undisputed predominancy in all the 
schools and the complete triumph of realism it is at this time 
namely in the thirteenth century that we have the great names among 
the schoolmen such as albertus magnus thomas aquinas and duns 
scotus the latter two of whom had their sects distinguished by the 
names of thomists and scotists in reaching the days of william of 
ockam who died in we attain another era his mind better 
constituted or better taught threw off much that was trifling and more
