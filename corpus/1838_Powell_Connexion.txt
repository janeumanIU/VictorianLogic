my dsab lobdi 

in availing myself of your lordships pennission to 
dedicate to you the ensuing volumei i am denrons briefly 
to refer to the grounds on which i made the request more 
especially because i feel assured that it is in the very same 
spirit ihat that request has been complied with 

the right use and just value of physical science in con 
nexion with the evidences and illustration of religious 
truth are topics always demanding serious attention but 
more especially in an age like the present abounding with 
false pretensions on the one hand and opposing prejudices 
on the other amid such errors and perversions it is 
a matter of particular satisfaction when the advocates of 
reason and truth find their efforts approved and encouraged 
by those whose situation in the church silences all cavils 
and in no instance b this more gratifying than when those 
who are now in the poation to confer that sanction have 
themselves previously been labourers in the diffurion and 

enlargement of the knowledge of nature

dedication 



your lordships sontimcnts on this important subject 
hare been sufficiently evinced were it only by the part you 
have taken in ihat vast association of british science which 
is now yearly exciting so general and powerful an interest 
in physical pursuits and by the xeal with which you liave 
there upheld the religious application of true philosophy 
— and asserted the revelation of ood in the volume of 
nature as our best guide to the manifestation of him in the 
pages of inspiration 

it was from such considerations that being engaged in a 
work having the same great object in view i vras naturally 
led to look to your lordships name as ihat which above all 
others would be most appropriately prefixed to it and most 
powerftdly assist in promoting the important end to which 
it is demgned to be subservient 

i remain 
with the greatest esteem and respect 
my dear lord 

most sincerely your

preface 



within a few years past an extiaordiiiaiy interest 
lias been evinced and an unusual supply of iroiks 
produced on subjects relating to the application of 
physical science to natural theology its connexion 
with revelation and the influence which physical 
truths have in guiding us even in the interpretation 
of scripture the tndn of writers called tonth by 
the bridge water bequest the reproduction of preys 
work illustrated and prefaced from the resources of 
a period of advanced knowledge and the various 
other publications to which these directly or indi 
rectly have given rise have together furnished a 
body of facts and arguments in which it might be 
supposed every topic would have been exhausted 
and nothing left to be desired in the analyris of 
those evidences on which the fundamental truths of 
all religion are established if we look more 
closely into the nature of the discussion we howoter 
perceive that this is far from being the case with 
the majority of writers on natural theology the 
mere accumulation of particular instance of design 
from different parts of the natural world has been 
almost the sole object of attention now though it 
cannot be denied that they have thus most advan 
tageously brought the resources of all branches of 
science to bear on the question yet to whatever 
source it may be traced a great deficiency appears 
to exist to the exact tmafysii afprincghi and the 
philosophy of the argument of which it must be 




x preface 

confessed we meet with frequent instances even 
among writers of high eminence the cultivators 
of physical science perhaps have not been gene 
rally disposed or qualified to enter upon logical dis 
tinctions while the theological and metaphysical 
inquirers have too commonly been but little versed 
in physical evidence and have thus failed to appre 
ciate and enforce the extent and importance of the 
great argument from the order and arrangement of 
physical lans and causes 

to bring united resources of both kinds to bear 
on the subject has been the professed object of some 
of the recent publications alluded to among these 
the bridgewater treatise of mr whewell the dis 
course of lord brougham and the fragment of 
mr babbage stand conspicuous especially when 
the first is taken in connexion with some passages 
in the histoy of the inductive sciences by the same 
author and the second with the natmnd tjieology 
of dr turton 

another avriter also has recently discussed the 
evidences of natural theology but with widely dif 
ferent views from any of those just referred to and 
to whose treatise as it has obtained a considerable 
share of commendation in certain quarters i must 
briefly allude viz a work entitled the whole doe 
trine of final causes c by the rev w j irons 
of queens college oxford london 

this writer upon professedly philosophical prin 
ciples and by an elaborate metaphysical argument 
has undertaken to maintain that a strictly natural 
theology logically deduced from the phenomena of 
creation is absolutely unattainable

object of showing the neccssitj and ausufficienqr 
of revelation iio pursues the argument bj enters 
ing largolf into the discussion of the nature of oatuet 
examining the opinions both ancient and modem 
on the subject and after considering the nature of 
final causes he at lengtli endeavours to show upon 
his previous notion of causes in general that the 
aigument from final causes is altogether fallacioui 
and iuubory hence he proceeds to contend for 
revelation as the only source of our kuonledge 
even of the ejistence of a deity a work of such 
pretensions supported by at least the apjiearance of 
extenuve research and ciiidition has natumlly de 
manded attention the greater part of these pages 
was written before i had seen mr ironss publica 
tion however some parts as they then stood i 
found related so closely to certain portions of that 
authors argument that they were already sufficient 
to explain the grounds of my eutire dissent from 
him in a few places as they fell iu with the line 
of my observatious i have since iutroduced some 
remarks which will be found to hear on other pomtb 
of his reasonidg 

i must here also odd a passing reference to 
mr babbagea fragment the ninth bridgewater 
tieatue to some of the philosophical views deve 
loped and illustrated in it i shall have oocasion to 
refer particularly in the course of the ensuing pages

of its geneial value especially as suggesting riob

turning them to account i am tjie more induced

xll preface 

to offer this remark because i am aware that the 
originality and novelty of the illustrations derived 
from an abstruse branch of science have not been 
generally appreciated and somewhat of singularity 
in the whole manner and appearance of the volume 
has tended perhaps to indispose some readers from 
doing justice to its real excellencies and even to 
doubt its tendency 

to return to the general subject upon long con 
tinued consideration it has appeared to me that much 
was still wanting to its complete and satisfactory elu 
cidation and that several important points relative 
to the anafysis of the aigument and nature of the rea 
soning remained untouched or very imperfectly ex 
plained even by those who have professedly entered 
more laigely upon a discussion of principles if then 
the aigument has seemed to me to call for such 
further extension and explanation as in the ensuing 
pages it is mj endeavour to supply it has been with 
the fullest appreciation of the numerous excellencies 
of the wtiters alluded to that i have engaged in the 
attempt to supply some of the deficiencies on points 
where i feel obliged to differ from them i have in 
genera avoided specific controversy or criticism and 
have usually stated my ovn views and arguments 
simply as they arose out of the course of the main 
discussion accomjianied by a reference which would 
sufficiently lead those readers who might be interested 
in it to uie comparison of what i have advanced 
with the views more or less opposite of the writers 
referred to 

my main object is to examine the coimexipn and 

the several great branches of the 



••¦¦piipipupp

inquiry — lctwecn physical science and natural theo 
logy as also between this and revealed religion 
each in succession iiniishidg the necessary basis of 
evidence to the next and again the indciendence 
of each with respect to the succeeding as essential 
to the order and force of the reasoning whilst they 
yet maintain a close connection with and reaction 
upon each other 

thus from the very natme of the case it will be 
apparent to what extent the present publication can 
have any claims to novelty in its topics among the 
various titers on kindred subjects i have met with 
none taking precisely the same line or embracing 
exactly the same range of subject as that which is 
proposed to be pursued in the ensuing treatise yet 
almost every one of the different branches of my 
subject has been more or less discussed by some of 
the authors alluded to in many cases my state 
ments are in fact no more than an elementary 
exposition of a particular branch of the subject often 
treated before by others yet i conceive i have 
best consulted perspicuity and brevity in laying down 
the principles as if delivering what was new to the 
reader without fonnally referring him to authors 
who have treated of it before 

it may perhaps be right to state that a great part 
of the argument in the fourtli section runs nearly 
parallel with that of a discourse which i some time 
since published intitled retdation oitd science 
oxford also the introductory portion of the 
first section is a reprint with a few alterations of 
a paper which i contributed to some early numbers 
of the magazine of pcptdar science vol i

zit preface 

in the details of examples adduced from different 
branclies of physical science i have endeavoured as 
fiur as possible to avoid technicalities or at least to 
explain the scientific terms referred to in the most 
popular form of illustration of which they appeared 
susceptible indeed throughout in the exposition of 
the argument it has all along been made an object 
to elucidate the principles in the most perspicuous 
manner which the nature of the subject would 
admit and to carry on the discussion in such a form 
as would be suitable to the general reader 

one further remark must be added in some of 
the late critical discussions on natural theology 
great stress has been laid as appears to me very 
mifairly on the omissions of certain writers no 
author ought fiiirly to be subject to animadversion 
for not discussing what the peculiar line of argument 
he has selected does not lead him to discuss i am 
therefore particulaily desirous of stating that the 
present work has no pretensions whatever to include 
a complete or systematic treatise on natural theology 
its outline embraces only certain particular questions 
connected with that science of a nature indeed 
preliminary and general in one part and in another 
supplement ar and discursive but in neither instance 
having any claim to be regarded as treating etery 
point belonging to the subject in a word i wish 
to bo judged of not by what i do not say but by 
what i do

introduction 



the study of natural theology cannot be pursued 
alone and disjoined from other branches of inquiij 
it has a close connexion iith the study of phy 
sical science on the one hand and with that of 
revelation on the other whether we dwell upon 
the nature of the evidences or upon the trutha 
established this connexion is equally intimate the 
stability of natural theology rests upon the demon 
strations of physical truth and upon the assurance 
of the great doctrines of natural theology must all 
proof and even all notion of a revelation be essen 
tially founded this intimate connexion and depen 
dence however is by no means generally undorstoodt 
often questioned and not unfrequently even dis 
paraged and denied 

in the discussion of the truths of natural theology 
much diflsculty has arisen in some minds and mneh 
misapprehension of the whole nature of the aigo 
ment the order and chain of proo indeed seems 
to require but little condderation to render it evident 
yet it is veiy generauy misconceived that prolifie 
source of mistake the ambiguity of terms operates 



¦ ¦¦¦ ¦¦vrifrji ¦ „ sj 



 nrntoducnon 

very avidely in introducing confusion of thought into 
all portions of tbe inquiry the nature of the proof 
on which the theories as they are often termed 
of natural philosophy depend — the distinction be 
tween inductive conclusions and hypotheses — the 
relative use and importance of the two — and the 
consequent nature and security of jthe basis on which 
natural theology rests — are all points on which there 
seems to me great need of attempts at a better 
elucidation than is commonly afforded and in 
immediate connexion with these topics the relation 
in which the scripture stands to philosophy esped 
auy where its expressions may be opposed to the 
conclusions of science is a point most preeminently 
requiring to be better explained 

by all thinking inquirers indeed the importance 
of the study of nature as subservient to the great 
aigument of natural theology is generally admitted 
and the evidences which it affords are for the most 
part such as address themselves powerfully to the 
conviction even of the least instructed inquirer and 
it is not one of the least weighty considerations in 
fiivour of the same great inferences that their evi 
donees are of a nature in some way appreciable by 
minds of all classes and constitutions and of all 
degrees of cultivation hie most cursory survey of 
nature inspires reflections of the same high tendency 
in the most illiterate as the profoundest investigation 
does in the most philosophical and the more closely 
and accurately the phenomena are scrutinised and 



wr y •¦¦ n r tlurh 



introducnon 

reduced under general laws the more powerful is tbe 
weight of the evidence to every intellect prepared to 
profit bj such inquiiy to supply all the detail of 
such proofs drawn from the innumerable particular 
cases evincing design and arrangement in the mate 
rial world has been the object of the labours of a 
long and distinguished series of writers 

but however manifest may be the particular proofs 
which reflection deduces from the observed order of 
nature — however clear the varied features of the 
view presented to our contemplation by a closer 
survey yet no small degree of confusion and per 
plexity often prevails as to the distinct grounds and 
order of the reasoning 

and however elaborately followed up the details 
may have been much still seems requisite in eluci 
dation of the great principles of the inquiry and 
in a searching and inquiring age it becomes more 
peculiarly needful to analyze the nature of our 
evidence and to be able with that confidence which 
belongs to a good and just cause to meet any sera 
tiny and to challenge any fair inquiry into the 
grounds of our convictions for which we can be 
duly prepared only by going fearlessly into the more 
precise examination of the actual principles which 
are involved in the reasoning 

it has been well observed by dr turton natural 

theology tf in fact natural phoeophy— 

physical science in its utmost extent — studied with 
especial attention to the marks of design which 

b t

iiaabariirr •¦ r ¦ik i 



 imtboducrnon 

are in succession furnished by the objects of inquiiy 
it has also been emphatically and eloquently said by 
another writer of the present day the study of 
natural philosophy and natural theology if rightly 
pursued are one and true science but a perpetual 
worsliip of god in the firmament of his powerf • 

now the object of the ensuing discussion is precisely 
to show haw and why this is the case tit what sense 
and an what grounds the identity of the two can be 
maintained and by carefully analyzing the nature 
of our impressions and convictions to render more 
secure the steps by which we ascend to these sublime 
truths and to expose more fully the errors and 
inconsistences by which such advance is too often 
impeded the proper relation and dependence of 
the several parts and stages of the inquiry dis 
turbed and the connexion and force of the whole 
broken and destroyed 

the importance and precise office of physical 
science in the support of divine truth altogether 
has been too commonly overlooked or misunder 
stood and often so totally misconceived as to give 
rise to the most unhappy prudices and lamentable 
hostility against it 

according to views of the subject not only popu 
larly received but even supported by the sanction of 
relipous authority the entire order and tendency of 
the inquiry seems to be wholly mistaken and inverted

natural philosophj is considered to engage the mind 
in the studj of what are termed second causes such 
inquiries are supposed to have a direct tendency to 
withdraw the thoughts fixm the first cause it 
is therefore the business of natural theology to 
remedy this evil though even natural theology is 
incompetent entirely to produce the desired effect 
and the authority of revelation must be called in to 
check the vain inquiries of reason which indeed it 
is generally safer and better to avoid and condemn 
altogether 

such is the confusion of ideas very commonly 
prevalent and which it is even considered impious 
to attempt to expose 

yet at the hazard of offending all such prejudices 
i shall proceed to an unshrinking examination of 
the real order and connexion of the evidences of 
physical science natural theology and revelation 
as mutually dependent upon and affecting each other 

that illiterate fanatics should inveigh with all the 
bitterness of sincere bigotry against the cultivation 
of science is less a matter of surprise than of pity 
but to find a similar course pursued by those who 
are the professed disciples of a purer and more 
rational creed must be a subject of deep regret to 
every friend of truth to find sentiments derogatory 
to the use of reason and the cultivation of the intel 
lect coming from those who by learning statiout 
and character ought to be the friends and advocatea 
of all sound and rational acquirements to bear the

condemnation of physical research as beset ivith 
danger to religion from those who ought to know its 
value as the sole basis of natural theology must 
under any circumstances be regretted not only by 
the advocates of science as such but above all by 
the real friends of religion 

to that unfortunate deficiency in our systems of 
public education by which physical science is prac 
tically excluded or at best degraded to a veiy 
secondary rank we must ascribe the deplorably low 
views of its nature and value which pervade the 
writings of many who in other respects are among 
the brightest ornaments of the church and the uni 
versities they are perpetually representing these 
pursuits as solely concerned with the dominion of 
man over the material elements and solely applied 
or applicable to the arts of life thus incompetent 
to appreciate the high intellectual and moral influx 
ence of a devotion to the study of nature they are 
sometimes led not only to deny such influence but 
even to accuse these pursuits of a tendency opposed 
to all religious impressions 

no effectual remedy for such a state of things will 
probably be found until physical science shall be 
duly recognised as an essential branch of a liberal 
education especially in the universities so long as 
the public in general are unable to judge of scientific 
pretensions philosophy will be degraded by the pro 
tendons of quackery and this will give a colour to 
the accusations of bigotiy the public mind will be

imposed upon by the misrepresentations of crafty 
jesuitism or the declamations of blind fanatidsm 
to expose such mischievous errors is one main 
object of the ensuing pages 

but it is to be hoped that this state of things may 
not continue it is to be hoped on every account 
for the sake of society itseli as well as of science 
for the sake of the general intellectnal improvement 
of mankind as well as of the encouragement of 
research and above all for the sake of the moral 
and religious influence which tme science never can 
fail to secure as affording the sole rational foundatipn 
of natural theology and by consequence of all further 
religious truth 

and if as indeed there seems abundant promise 
may before long be the case the course of public 
opinion shall take a direction in accordance with the 
just claims of physical science how infinitely more 
pernicious will it be that this absurd and unhappy 
hostility should be cherished and kept up on the 
part of those who ought to be the ministers and 
disseminators of truth 

to expose then such mischievous errors as those 
just adverted to to explain the real bearing of phy 
sical science and vindicate its essential services to 
natural theology and in its consequences to revealed 
religion also forms a main objeet of my discussion 
the attainment of this object requires a closer exami 
nation into some of the first principles of the subject 
to which too little attention has hitherto been paidy

and this brings us into close connexion with the 
essential nature of the great rules of induction as 
established and explained by thdr illustrious pro 
jounder and more especially as contrasted with the 
sources of false philosophy and erroneous theory 
which he lias happily designated and clasrified under 
the name of idola the fijse divinities which the 
mind is apt to raise as the objects of its worship and 
at whose shrine truth is often sacrificed — a portion 
of his aigument which is found more full of valuable 
instruction the more extendvely it is examined and

by the mere subtilty of their reasoning powers to a 
comprehension of the entire system of the material 
universe 

but the appeal to experiment and observation 
and the high and pure physical philosophy inculcated 
by bacon and practically followed up by galileo 
newton and their successors soon established the 
dominion of principles at once more correct and 
rational and better suited to the limited range of 
the human faculties by the humble unpretending 
path of the inductive method all the great triumphs 
of physical discovery have been achieved by a 
steady adherence to its principles can we alone 
expect the further extension of natural knowledge 
and so long as they are adhered to we can assign 
no limit to the progressive advance which may be 
made and minds duly impressed with the sub 
limity of those inquiries which the contemplation of 
the universe suggests will easily recognise the truth 
and value of this method they perceive in the refe 
rence to observation and experience an appeal to the 
sole authority of nature they would interrogate her 
in her own language and in the replies to those inter

the only means by which the laws of the material 
world can be successfully elicited and established 
and by which simplicity and order are educed out of 
the yast mass and as might appear inextricable 
complexity of accumulated phenomena 

the claims of the inductive pliilosophy are in 
deed now generally allowed and its praises held 
forth still not unfrequently even its advocates and 
encomiasts entertain very indistinct notions of the 
real nature of the system they support and it be 
comes the more necessary to examine carefully the 
nature of tlie reasoning and the general ground qf 
tjie ecidenccf by which experimental laws and physi 
cal truths are substantiated and this in fact is 
what is meant by the expressions so commonly used 
the inductive method the inductive logic 
experimental evidence and the like the object 
of the present section is to analyze their meanings 
and endeavour to exemplify and elucidate the nature 
of our convictions and inferences in these branches 
of knowledge the degree of certainty of which 
they are susceptible and the sources of failure and 
error to which we are most exposed in the proseon 
tion of physical inquiry without some wellgrounded 
principles of this kind as our guide and without 
restricting ourselves to too formal and technical a 
method to examine briefly the real nature of the 
inductive process and to illustrate by fiuniliar ex 
amples wherein the most essential and characteristic

features of inductive evidence consist as distinguished 
on the one hand from the mere evidence of our 
senses and on the other firom demonstration 

meaning and nature of indadiom 

at the present day so common is the use of the 
term inductive philosophy that it may be pre 
sumed there are few persons who have not at least 
some apprehension of the sort of investigation 
which it is used to designate 

in its more general signification this term is 
employed to describe the entire method of modem 
physical science as peculiarly characterized by rest 
ing on the appeal to experiment and observation 
alone and as contradistinguished from the scho 
lastic systems which proposed to reason downwards 
from abstract principles to natural laws and pheno 
mena the inductive on the contrary ascends firom 
observed phenomena to general laws and abstract 
prindples 

in its more limited sense however induction 
is understood to signify the process of inferring and 
collecting general results general facts or laws 
from a number of particular instances carefully 
established on actual experimental evidence it is 
the nature of the process thus designated and the 
principles on which it is conducted that we propose 
to explain and comment upon 

now it is dear that the first step in such a pro 
cess must be the collection and classification of a 
number of particular phenomena the careful

mination of a nnmber of individual casesi in wder 
to discover some common property or circnmrtanoe 
in which they all agree amid many others in idiieh 
they differ 

does then the process consist merely in thifl fhat 
we examine every individual of a classy or number of 
objects before us and finding each one to poness a i 

particular property affirm that as a common pro 

perty of the class this certainly would imply no 

exercise of reasoning and would hardly be worthy 
the name of induction we should be merely 
affirming a proposition for whose truth we had the 
direct evidence of our senses yet perhaps among 
cases even of this sort there may exist much diffisr 
ence as to the extent and labour of the reseaidk we 
may have to go through in detecting the one pro 
perty which is common to all the individual cases 
and constitutes the characteristic by which we give 
them a common classification and a generic name 
the point in which all the examined instances agrees 
may indeed be manifest at first sight but sgaint 
it may be fitr otherwise and though vre have all the 
cases before us especially if they be numerous it 
may yet require no small labour and skill to snoceed 
in tracing out what the property or circumstance is 
in which they all agrees amidst a variety of others 
in which they differ the first case requires nothing 
further than the bare inspection of the instances

the latter may call forth mach discrimiiiatite skill 
the former is the work of the mere collector the 
latter may involve that of the philosopher but in 
any case other than the most immediately obvious 
there is this to be remarked and it is deserving of 
particular attention it is almost certun that in the 
first instance the mind will conjecturally fix upon 
some property which is imaned whether correctly 
i or not most likely to be the common one sought 

long before a complete examination of all the indi 
viduals has taken place 

let us suppose on the other hand that we have 
fhd ab the individual facts before us we observe 
a certain number of them and finding them agree 
in some property we are almost invariably prone at 
once to infer that all the rest possess it likevnse 
we infer more than we see there is certainly a 
strong natural tendency in the human mind even 
upon very slight apparent grounds to advance from 
individual facts to general conclusions — to hazard 
inferences firom the known to the unknown

the inductive method 

it not rather a most groundless presumption yet 
it may be asked does it not possess all the cbarac 
teristics of induction as they have been laid down 
by some logical writers for wherein does the 
case we have supposed differ from their commonly 
cited example this that and the other loadstone 
attracts iron — therefore all loadstones do or 
why is not the former of these instances as good 
reasoning as the latter 

in the case of the balls we cannot assign or 
imagine any reason why one should be white because 
others are so any supposable connexion between 
the circumstance of the balls being together in the 
bag and their colour there is no tendency to 
fancy or expect it on the other hand in the 
case of the loadstone having observed the effect 
in a few instances we feel a natural tendency to 
imagine that the same magnetic property subsists 
whenever we perceive the same external charac 
teristics we cannot avoid being persuaded that 
there is a connexion between that particular dark 
ness of colour weight hardness texture c by 
which we recognise the mineral and a magnetic 
power though we may be at a loss to explain w 
assign the ground for it 

yet the only thing which seems at all to warrant 
the induction from a limited number of instances 
is the reasonableness of such an intuitive persuasioil 
when therefore we have only a limited number of 
instances which we can examine and such is the 

o

 evidbnce of physical truth 

case in fact in almost all physical inquiries no 
inductive inferences can properly be made unless 
we feel assured of some probable ground for expect 
ing a common connexion to subsist between the 
individual cases can we then succeed in tracing 
any probable principle to which the existence of 
such a persuasion may be traced — can we analyse 
it up to any rational ground of belief this is a 
most important point of our inquiry and to it our 
attention must next be directed see note a 

bdief in the umformity of nature 

now there is one grand fundamental principle 
without which no induction of laws from particular 
instances no generalizations of individual truths no 
regular or systematic study of nature could ever 
proceed and this is our conviction of a permanence 
and uniformity in the order of natural things our 
belief that that which has happened in succession 
for days and years past vrill under the same circum 
stances continue to happen for time to come our 
persuasion that what so takes place in one instance 
in one place will and does take place under the 
same conditions in all other instances and in all 
other places we suppose that is that nature u jo 
cotutuutedf that there exists same principle of undo 
viating regularity in the connexion of qualities and 
properties of causes and effects even though we 
should fail in always tracing it

this belief undoubtedly exists and operates in 
very different degrees in different minds but a 
share of it at least is so universal that some meta 
physicians have been disposed to regard it as consti 
tuting one of the inherent principles of our nature 
thus the most ignorant person infers that the sun 
rill rise tomorrow and for succeeding days and 
years because he has so regularly witnessed it 
before and that a stone fsodls to the ground as con 
stantly in america as in europe 

in the limited form in which we commonly notice 
the operation of this sort of intuitive persuasion it 
certainly does not amount to anything like a philo 
sophical conviction of the uniformity of natural 
causes it is doubtless restricted to certain iso 
lated classes of facts which in all their circumstances 
are constantly falling under the observation in 
those limited instances the individual perhaps 
relies on their recurrence from mere habit which 
probably does not produce in his mind any general 
belief that other events beyond the limits of his 
observation are regulated by any like constant uni 
formity nor when the idea is suggested is he able 
to perceive the force of the inference from analogy 
but probably imagines all things beyond the pre 
cise extent of his observation to be destitute of any 
determinate order and the course of events in

general either under the dominion of arbitrary 
agency or abandoned to chance or blind destiny 

in proportion however as the mind is more cul 
uvated and man accustomed to reflect and reason 
on the objects continually presented to his senses 
he is naturally and even unconsciously led to en 
large his persuasion of the general recurrence of 
natural phenomena in the same order in which he 
has several times witnessed it this persuasion 
easily extends itself to a great variety of particular 
instances in which its correctness is soon verified 
by observation the same habitual judgment thus 
guns strength by every hours experience the 
confidence with which the mind calculates as it 
were upon the permanence of a certain order in 
physical events increases with rapidlyaccumulating 
force and the improvement of the faculties by 
study and the enlargement of our stores of infer 
mation from wider observation of physical figtcts 
soon begins to induce the habit of extending our 
persuasion of the uniformity of natural causes be 
yond the mere bounds of fsuniliar phenomena to 
those which are placed out of our immediate exa 
mination but which we come naturally to imagine 
must be regulated by a like constancy 

founded then on the natural constitution of the 
human mind confirmed by daily experience and 
verified by every advance in the accurate study both 
of mental and material phenomena the belief in 
the existence of this uniformity becomes in fiieti

the basis of all acquisition of knowledge and 
enables us without hesitation to advance in oar 
conclusions from the known to the unknown from 
truths actually before us and within our reach to 
those which may be hidden from us or beyond the 
limits of sensible experience 

the belief in the uniformity and permanence of 
natural order combined with and perhaps depen 
dent on the tendency of the human mind to gene 
ralize its observations unite to supply as it were 
at once the first impulse and primary elements of 
philosophic investigation but it is further neces 
sary that much care and skill be employed in tho 
direction and use of them before they can prodaoe 
any substantial results we have then frirther to 
inquire how this is to be done and we shall find 
that the models by which we must be guided are to 
be found in the careful and extended study of 
already established natural relations 



 



antecedent probability in induction 



the principles by which we are to be 
advancing to sound generalizations of observed phy 
sical relations must be those derived from the care 
ful study and comparison of such generalizations 
previously confirmed in other corresponding in 
stances which will suggest probabilities antecedent 
jto actual experience 

it will be to little purpose that we are persuaded 
of the existence of wme uniformity in natural um

unless we have this guide to asust in tracing what 
the irinciple of uniformity is in any particular case 
without such assistance we may go on collecting 
and observing a vast number of cts and yet arrive 
at no conclusions or only at such as are altogether 
empty and visionary 

as we have already remarked that merely to 
affirm what we observe in common of a number of 
individuals all of which are before us is hardly 
worthy the name of an induction so it is a violation 
of all just induction to infer a general property from 
too limited a number of instances but what consti 
tutes the sufficient number of instances must depend 
on the nature of the case and the experience and 
power of judgment possessed by the inquirer 

and if we fall into the error of too small an in 
duction the usual cause of such error is rather that 
the induction is vnting in a just principle of pro 
bability in our first conjecture or that we have pro 
ceeded on the supposition of a wrong sort of rela 
tion it is this which has commonly much more to 
do with the justness of our conclusion than the 
mere number of instances collected and on the 
other hand it oflen happens that a very few in 
stances or even almost a single instance have been 
admitted without question as a sufficient verificatioii 
but this has depended entirely on the justness of the 
assumed rdatkm 

we win illustrate these remarks by a few ex 
amples both of successful and unsuccessful indiie 
tionfl in different departments of science

the inducnve method 

 newton on jiassing a ray of light through a 
prism of glass found it separated into coloured rays 
and measuring the proportion in which it is thus 
spread out or dispersed announced that propor 
tion as the general law of prismatic dispersion 

dr lucas repeated the experiment but assigned 
a mtich less propaition as the law both parties posi 
tively maintained the correctness of their resectit 
conclusions but they had both argued on a fiuiltjr 
ground of induction they had each taken for 
granted that their prisms ought to act equally on 
light the fact was they had used different sorts 
of glass which vary considerably in disperdve 
power 

tliis is remarkable as one of the very few instance 
in which newton ffdlcd in an induction but sadi 
failures are instructive for we learn to observe the 
reason of the error it was manifestly from neglect 
ing to consider in this case what probabilihf there 
mould be previous to trials that different sorts of 
glass should possess the same dispersive power 

on the other hand newtons capital result that 
 to the same ray ever belongs the same refrangi 
bility the media being the same is a condusioiip 
indeed of a most general nature and which universal 
experience has amply confirmed but it vras founded 
on a very limited induction derived from prismatio 
experiments vnth at most three or four different 
media 

 the early history of astronomy is foil of

examples of the compatibilitj of accumulated obser 
vation with the want of satisfieutory induction the 
ancient astronomers were indetigable in the dili 
gcnce with which they amassed observations but 
ihej constructed out of them no theoiy which could 
attain a real permanence the system of ptolemy 
sufficed to a certain extent to represent the observed 
motions of the planets the advance in accuracy 
of observations however soon required correspond 
ing improvements in the system which was obliged 
to be modified to accord with them but at length 
the immense complexity introduced by the cycles 
and epicycles which were necessary to account for 
the apjiarent motions began to induce a persuasion 
that such complication could not be the real law of 
nature juster principles were therefore to be sought 
no astronomer ever laboured more sedulously in 
making and recording observations than tycho 
brahe but though eruaded of the insufficiency 
of the ptolemaic hyikthesis he did not succeed in 
constructing a better not from deficiency of facts 
but from his strangelyerroneous assumption of a 
guiding theoretical principle 

kepler worked upon tychos materials the 
labour mhich he bestowed on calculation was abso 
lutely incredible but tlieoiy after theoiy was 
adopted and rejected because he had not any other 
guide than random conjecture and nothing but the 
accurate calculation of every detail could suffice to 
put those conjectures to the test ho had not

lighted on anj happy ground of antecedent proba 
bilittf avlien however at last ho did seize upon 
the true law of nature the numerical verification 
was perfect and decisive and when thus established 
in the single instance of the planet mar it is 
extremely instructive to observe the rapidity and 
facility with which the inference was extended to 
the whole solar system 

when the laws of the motion of one planet were 
established a single conjecture sufficed to point out 
ith the highest degree of probability the laws of 
all the other planetary orbits and a single calcula 
tion to verify it the difference was that there 
was now a ground of antecedent probability a pre 
sumption of a guiding resemblance which though 
not strictly proved was yet such as to leave no 
doubt that it had some foundation in nature 

analogy tlie chvtmd of antecedent probability 

thus then it is manifest that to possess some 
reasonable ground of antecedent probability as a 
guide to our conclusion is absolutely essential to 
physical induction and we cannot employ the 
term correctly in its higher sense as referring to 
anything above a mere collection of instances with 
out meaning to include secially the notion of a fair 
presumption of some relation in virtue of which we 
can argue from the known to the unknown and 
infer that those cases which w o pot ee are pro

bably connected with tbose which we do this con 
stitutes one most essential characteristic of the 
inductive process and without it assuredly we can 
never advance to a substantial conclusion we 
must always then consider the inductive method as 
referring not merely to the accumulation of in 
stances but as vwdting the idea of some presiding 
conception some guiding principle of presumed cofi 
neanon and probable rdation between the facts on 
which we are reasoning 

in replying then to the inquiry what constitutes 
the ground of antecedent probability so essential to 
a good induction it will be almost apparent from 
the examples already cited that the main ground is 
that afforded by the comparison of one doss of phe 
fiofnena with another the perception of a paralldism 
in their respective conditions the existence of an 
analogy between them 

the success then with which induction may be 
carried on depends on the just appreciation of such 
trains of analogy this can only be attained by a 
habit of cautiously comparing our presumed gene 
ralization with already established laws one induc 
tion must be the guide to another we must seek 
to interpret nature in agreement with her own 
principles already displayed every real natural 
truth we may be assured will be in harmony with 
other parts of the great series and scale of natural 
truth with this our hypothesis must be in accord 
ance to ascertiun and verify such accordance is the 



 t • i v •¦ ¦jt 



the inducixye method 

aim of the true philosopher and it is entirely on 
the justness with which it is preserved that the 
whole truth and success of induction depends 

observation exhibits a certain law or relation 
among a particular class of facts this suggests to 
the mind of the philosopher the probability of the 
same relation in another collection of facts which 
leads to the belief that the cases are parallel the 
relation being firmly established in one set of in 
stances he feels satisfied avith even a slight indica 
tion of it in the other the conviction of its pro 
bability once formed a very few cases adduced serve 
to verify it the experience of instances actually 
tried leads to the expectation of analogous results 
in cases untried but the essential point is the real 
parallelism of the cases the hypothesis will be 
philosophical or not according to the extent and 
justness of the comparison which has suggested it 

for example i experiment had shown that 
electricity in a high state of tension discharges itself 
vnth a flash and a report lightning and thunder 
exhibited an instance of a flash and a report the 
atmosphere was known to be susceptible of eleo 
trical influence all this bad been ascertained but 
no relation had been established between the cases 
other causes might possibly produce a flash an a 
report but the analogy of electricity presented 
itself strongly to the philosophic mind of franklin 
by the string of a kite as a conductor he brought 
down the electricity of the clouds which on its 




tr

arrival at tlie ground was regularly discharged with 
sjiarks and the analogy couterted into an identity 

 every one had been accustomed for ages 
before the time of newton to observe that bodies 
fall to the ground as soon as support is withdrawn 
they were equally fiuniliar with the fact that the 
moon circulates periodically about the earth but 
no one ever perceived any relation or imaginable 
connexion between these two classes of fietcts nay 
the peripatetics mdntaining that the heavenly mo 
tions were of an essentially different kind from the 
terrestrial led men to the belief that these two cases 
could not possibly have any common relation 

the penetrating mind of newton however in 
stantly perceived a connexion between them he 
considered that a body launched into space would 
continue to move off in a straight line unless made 
to deviate from that path by the action of some other 
cause now the moon does not go off in a recti 
linear path but has her course continually j f rom 
such direction into a curvilinear orbit round the 
earth and the degree in which it is thus bent or 
the amount of doaiation from the straight course is 
in fact so much of a real fall towards the earth 
the moon is actually falling like a stone and the 
amount of its fell can be measured since astrono 
mical observation has given the size and form of 
its orbit and the rapidity of its motion that i 
uio amount of the deviation also the amount 
of the foil of a stone near the enrths surface

 known it becomes a matter of calculation 
to compare them newton made the comparison 
and found the two effects precisely in the inverse 
proportion of the squares of the distances from the 
eartvs centre this was the precise proportion 
which would agree with the supposition of that law 
of central force which on abstract mechanical prin 
ciples ought to gtye rise to elliptic orbits and to 
certain relations expressed by numerical laws between 
the magnitudes of those orbits and the motions in 
them these were the very same as those numerical 
relations which had been found by kepler long before 
to subsist in the planetary revolutions 

thus the single circumstance of the amdogjf be 
tween the moons motion and that of a stone fauing 
to the ground sufficed as a clue to the whole system 
of planetary motions and the establishment of the 
principle of universal gravitation 

 physical philosophers had been long seeking 
to establish what there was eveiy reason to suspect 
the existence of at least a close connexion if not 
absolute identity between electricity galvanism and 
magnetism there were many points of resemblance 
in what was known of the nature of those agents 
experiments had been multiplied and many curious 
fiicts and results had been accumulated but all 
this collection of fads had not afforded a real umifo 
iion and the reason was that the inquirers had 
been guided either by no principle of analogy or by 
sucli as was inoomct 




jilimiiaiiiiimiiamiifciiabia iiitfiiiiirvi 



 evidence of phtsigal truth 

the most powerful electric forces had been re 
sorted to but no evolution of galvanic influence no 
shock however strong would affect the magnetic 
needle experimenters were accustomed to witness 
the most intense electric action when the current 
was brokeuf or the accumulated power discharged 
here therefore they expected to find the greatest 
effect of a magnetic kind 

but these modes of action were of a kind offering 
no analogy to those really concerned in the cases in 
question this however was not perceived till 
ersted discovered the true point of connexion of 
electricity and magnetism he succeeded by a very 
slight change in the arrangement from that with 
which his predecessors had been so long and so 
fruitlessly working by using an unbroken galvanic 
circuit he instantly found an influence on the mag 
netic needle not by violent concentration of forces 
but by a peculiar diffusion of them and the whole 
system of action by transverse currents was almost 
immediately developed and followed out into all its 
correlative trains of consequences 

 newton published his prinapia before any 
instance of the periodical return of a comet had been 
established or even imagined yet on comjmring 
the masses of these bodies and their distances with 
those of the planets he caught an analogy and did 
not hesitate to speak positively of their describing 
orbits about the sun and to recommend to future 
astronomers to verify their returns by comparison of

observations it is superfluous to notice how 
completely this idea has been borne out by subse 
quent discoveries 

 in the extension of the law of gravitation 
from the foil of a stone on the earth to the motions 
of the most distant planet or the most erratic comet 
we have a remarkable instance where a conclusion is 
made from effects which we observe near us to those 
of the same kind which are produced in the remotest 
regions of space let us compare this with a parallel 
case in time we observe the daily formation of 
rounded pebbles by the action of the waves on frag 
ments of rock on the seashore and we find the 
incessant continuance of that action for a long time 
give rise to accumulated beds of shingle 

now over large tracts of land at considerable 
elevations above the sea we find immense beds of 
jiebbles presenting precisely the same appearance of 
rolled and rounded fragments as those we now 
observe in the progress of formation in the sea it 
is then by the same process of reasoning which 
connects the gravitation of a stone with that of the 
moon or the remotest planet or comet that we 
connect the formation of beds of pebbles at the 
present day with that of similar beds in ages of 
remote antiquity when the present dry land formed 
the bottom of the ocean or rather was graduauy 
emerging from it through such a long succession

of ages as would alone suffice for the production 
of the immense beds of rolled gravel which we 
find deposited over a kige part of the surfiuh of

force physical analogies 

philosophical induction then proceeds mainly by 
seizing upon analogies between known orders of 
facts known relations of cause and effect and cases 
where the existence of such relations is unknown 
but where the circumstances render it probable that 
they also subsist such circumstances perhaps quite 
casual and unimportant in the eyes of the ordinary 
observer suggest in an instant to the practised mind 
of the philosophical inquirer a train of relations in 
which the analogy is maintained he proceeds to 
verify his idea a single experimental instance often 
suffices to confirm it and at most a very few repe 
titions and variations in the circumstances and con 
ditions satisfy him that his analogy is correct and 
the uniformity of the law by which physical action 
is determined becomes established 

in feet so essential to induction is the dependence 
on analogy tliat in the very use of the terms 
 observation experience and the like by many 
writers to describe the grounds of our belief in phy 
sical events it is evident that they mean to include 
asehtiahjf the reference to analogy and not barely to 
ftcts actually witnessed unless this be the case

indeed their meaning would in some cases be 
involved in absurdity and contradiction 

thus then the most important part of the process 
of induction consists in seizing upon the probable 
connecting relation by which we can extend what 
we observe in a few cases to all in proportion to 
the justness of this assumption and the correctness 
of our judgment in tracing and adopting it will the 
induction be successful the methods by which a 
facility in discovering such relations and a readiness 
in forming such judgment may be attained and 
improved are precisely the objects principally to be 
kept in view by the philosophical student who would 
prepare himself for the work of interpreting the 
phenomena of the natural world the analogies to 
be pursued must be those suggested from already 
ascertained laws and relations this in proportion 
to the extent of the inquirers previous knowledge of 
such relations subsisting in other parts of nature 
will be his means of guidance to a correct train of 
inference in that before him 

and he who has even to a limited extent been 
led to observe the connexion between one class of 
physical truths and another will almost unconsd 
ously acquire a tendency to perceive such relations 
among the fiicts continually presented to him the 
truth of the remark to which we have been thus 
led is amply confirmed by the history of philosophical 
discoveiy

inductive have very seldom been really attuned by 
the mere process of amassing collections of individual 
facts it has been almost invariably the case that 
hypothesis has preceded observation and that the 
discoverer has in truth only verified by an appeal to 
experiment the general theory which he had already 
imagined the happy selection of such hjrpotheses 
is that which characterizes and in fact constitutes 
philosophical genius and a just appreciation of the 
use of such imaginary provisional assumptions emi 
nently distinguishes the rational inquirer from the 
speculative visionary the true philosopher neither 
discards hypothesis on the one hand nor yields him 
self up to it on the other but rates it at its proper 
value and turns it to its legitimate use he is 
always ready to reject an assumed theory the moment 
he finds it unsupported by fact but if it be once 
duly substantiated to adopt it and be prepared to 
follow it out into all its legitimate consequences 
however at variance with received notions — however 
contrary to established prejudices — however opposed 
to the prepossessions the bigotry the cherished 
delusions of mankinds 

and the more extensive his acquaintance with 
nature the more firmly is he impressed with the 
belief that some such relation must subsist in all 
eases however limited a portion of it he may be 
able actually to trace and it is by the exercise of 
an unusual skill in this way that the greatest philo 
sophers have been able to achieve their triumphs in

tlic reduction of facts under the dominion of general 
laws 

but important as these natural analogies are to 
the philosopher they are yet of a nature which 
renders it difficult to make them generally appre 
ciated and unless by actual and attentive study of 
physical science it is difficult to convey an adequate 
conception of the irresistible claim to acceptance 
with which they present themselves to the mind of 
a person even moderately versed in such inquiries 
yet they are in fact no more than extensions of 
the very same elements of thought which seem 
implanted in our nature by which all our acquaint 
ance with sensible objects is in the first instance 
acquired and by which we are continually and 
unconsciously storing our minds with that knowledge 
which is so necessary for all the purposes of our 
existence — those natural persuasions upon which all 
uniform convictions and all consistent conduct is 
based — and without which life would be a continued 
state of infistnqr 

matliematical law 

it is not perhaps until we come to contemplate 
natural phenomena exhibited in the form of nume 
rical results and find those data reducible to mathe 
matical laws that we fully appreciate the reality and 
exactness of that uniformity by which all nature 
works the coincidence with such laws it that

nrliich above all others impresses as with the con 
viction of invariable order and nniformitj pervading 
the material universe 

we find this in the first instancy in the reduc 
tion of vast collections of observed numerical results 
under simple mathematical formulas but the more 
extended application of mathematical analysis power 
fullj augments the impression produced on our 
minds by the conspiring inductions and corroborating 
generalizations of purely physical investigations 
from some one very simple remote and abstract 
datum obtained from elementary physical facts we 
often proceed by purely mathematical reasoning 
perhaps through a long and intricate deduction 
which at length brings us to the conclusion that 
under certain conditions a particular kind of action 
ought to take place and even the precise amount 
of its effects ought to be such as are given by a 
certain analytical expression the results of obser 
vation exactly accord with these deductions and 
even the minutest variations in the effects are 
exactly represented by calculation from the formula 
of theory 

we have occasionally singular exemplifications of 
the existence of recondite principles of analogy in 
the coincidence of phenomena with the symbolical 
indications of mathematical analyds a mathema 
tical formula is found which expresses the law of a 
certain class of phenomena the analytical language 
tf symbols admits perhaps of certain changes or

embraces certain cases not at all contemplated in 
the first numerical establishment of the law but 
dejiendent purely upon abstract algebraical rules and 
transformations these symbolical changes shall be 
found to have physical cases exactly corresponding 
to them 

in the higher departments of phydcal optics 
this has been most surprisingly exemplified we 
need only cite the marvellous prediction of the 
conversion of plane into circular polarization of 
light by two internal reflections in glass made and 
verified by m fresnel entirely upon the strength of 
certain mechanical and mathematical analogies a 
conclusion as professor forbes justly remarks 
 which no general acuteness could have foreseen 
and which was founded on the mere analogy of cer 
tain interpretations of imaginary expressions the 
mere reasoner about phenomena could never have 
arrived at the result — the mere mathematician 
would have repudiated a deduction founded upon 
analogy alone 

induction in naiurat histary 

there is perhaps no branch of sdence in which 
the use of analogy as subservient to the process oi 
induction is more conspicuously and instructively 
displayed than in comparative anatomy and physio 
logy thus cuvierf emphatically remarks that

a naturalist in his researches happening to find 
only a hoof directly and certainly infers that it ¥ras 
associated with grinding teeth having flat surfaces 
a long alimentary canal a large stomach or several 
and many other similar cliaracteristics yet such 
conclusions are of a nature strictly inductive 
again the system of the organs of motion is 
universally found to be so austed that a variation 
in the form of one bono is invariably accompanied 
by variations more or less in all the others thus 
in any new case which may present itself from a 
single bone the skilful naturalist will often be able 
to infer the form of the whole skeleton on what 
does the legitimacy of such inferences depend on 
what ground of confidence can such reasoning be 
pursued but on the assurance of those unfailing 
principles of analogy which unquestionably pervade 
the entire range of organized nature and thus sup 
ply the main ground of stability to these inductive 
conclusions 

that whenever a new plant or animal is dis 
covered we should never come to any thing ano 
malous or at variance vrith systematic order but 
that even in those instances which are apparently 
the most unlike any previously known the skilful 
naturalist should always succeed in assigning to the 
production in question its precise place in the scale 
and order of organized beings and that all fresh dis 
coveries should but fill up blanks in the scheme is 
the strongest proof of the existence of some priih 



r i ir tkr r •vvwjjfcaa 



the inducmvs method 

ciple of the most recondite tmiformity throughout 
all the modifications of organized structures in 
fact to elucidate and deyeloie such principles of 
uniformity and analogy has been the very object of 
the labours of the most eminent naturalists and 
the best proof of the actual prevalence and ad 
mirable unity of those principles is found in the 
increasing simplicity to which the arrangement of 
natural classes has been reduced 

tlius the researches of cuvier reduce the laws of 
animated existence to only four princijial types 
or general schemes of organization founded on the 
presence or absence of vertebrae after which as he 
observes all animals appear to have been modelled 
and of which the subordinate divisions are only 
comparatively slight modifications founded on the 
developcment or addition of certain parts which 
produce no essential change in the original plan 
viz the vertebrata with bony skeletons the 
mouusca soft with shells the articulata jointed 
or ringed the radiata or zoophytes 

within the limits of each of these four classes 
cuvier traced a precise set of analogies among all 
their various subdivisions so that for every member 
 or organ in one species there was to be found in 
variably some member or oigan in all the others 
holding exactly the same place in relation to the 
general structure and nature of the animal and 
thus between the two extreme instances which fidl

utmost possible dimmilarittf in every respect yet 
there was found the closest andogy in every crea 
ture of that class could be pointed out by the skil 
fill comparative anatomist an exact correspondence 
in the nature and office of every part relative to the 
nature of the animal though bearing not the 
slightest resemblapice when however these great 
classes themselves were compared together such 
analogy seemed to be no further traceable each 
class seemed to include a distinct plan of organiza 
tion possessing an unity within itself but not appa 
rently related to that of the other classes but 
these views have been pushed further another 
school of physiologists among whom geoffiey st 
hilaire stands most conspicuous have contended 
that even these breaks between the four classes may 
be filled up and new principles of analogy deve 
loped and traced out by which these apparently dis 
tinct plans of organization may bo shown to have a 
common system of relation and thus throughout 
all classes a principle of still more recondite con 
nexion be percrived 

this principle carried out to its full extent has 
been named the unity of plan or of composition 
or the theory of analogues and the particular 
views of structure by which it is upheld have been 
designated as the equilibrization of organs or 
other similar names vhile however the main 
principle of the reality of some such system of pri 
mitive tyjies is universally recognised by naturalists

yet considerable difference of opinion prevails as to 
the details of its application and as to the extent to 
which it may be followed out and the question 
which has thus arisen has occasioned conaderable 
controversy between the partisans of the two rival 
schools principally perhaps in consequence of its 
being mixed up with other topics with which it has 
at least no necessary connexion and to which we 
shall recur in another place with reference to our 
present purpose it will be sufficient to remark 
simply that the question between these theories or 
rather the question whether the caiensioii given to 
the great principle of uniformity by the second of 
them is true must be decided merely by physiolo 
gical evidence it is purely a question of fadt and 
must be investigated by careful examination and 
enlightened comparison of facts and analogies with 
out any reference to the speculative topics with 
which it has been mixed up a distinction which 
however plain seems to have been too much over 
looked 

but however this question may be determined 
our chief consideration should be to observe either 
way how beautiful an extension of the great prin 
ciples of natural order and harmonious arrangement 
is opened to our view and it is the increasing 
assurance of this which is continually strengthening 
the foundation of all our inductive reasonings of 
all consistent and profitable search into the laws of 
the material creation

induction in geology 

we meet vrith perhaps the most remarkable in 
stances of the application of the inductive concla 
sions of comparative anatomy in deciphering the 
liistoiy of fobsil remains the whole subject is in 
in fact only a continued series of such inferences 
the entire structure nature and habits of animals 
once inhabiting the earth are deduced from the 
occurrence of a few bones or perhaps a single tootht 
or scale embedded and mineralized in some now 
solid rock and yet with the full force of inductive 
evidence 

it is upon the study of fossil organic remains that 
the conclusions of geology mainly depend and in 
a more general point of view the researches of this 
science afford some of the best examples of the vast 
range of inference to which strict induction may 
be extended of conclusions apparently the most 
remote the most inconceivable the most startling 
yet all evinced by the same rigidly inductive process 
by which the most palpable laws of mechanical 
action are established tlie observer finds at vari 
ons elevations above the sea beds of shells and 
remains of marine animals buried beneath the soil 
or imbedded in the solid rock he comes most legi 
timately to the conclusion that these relics were 
buried when the beds of sofl or rock were in the 
roce of formation in a soft state when they 
formed in fact the bottom of the waters in which 



m iirfr iti rrr ir ir iif ¦ 



the inducnvb method 



or on the margin tlie animals lived and died and 
tliat these beds have since been imd di and de 
vated into their present pomtion 

again he finds one sort of earth or rock extend 
ing over a considerable tract from beneath which at 
the edge of that tract another of a widely different 
species comes up and appears at the surfiice show 
ing its relative position wherever a section maj be 
made and proved to exist under the other wherever 
a well is simk to a sufficient depth he infers that 
the lower was deiksited before the upper and this 
simply on the same evidence as that on which we 
believe that the roof of a house was built at a later 
time than the foundation though we did not wit 
ness it 

again the geologist calls in the aid of the natu 
ralist in the upper strata the fossil remuns are 
found nearly agreeing with existing species in the 
lower some perhaps the same but many totally dif 
ferent belonging that is to species not now known 
to exist he carries on the research and in another 
still lower stratum of a different kind of material 
finds fewer or none of existing species and many 
or all extinct species nay whole genera and even 
orders of animals successively disappearing and new 
ones taking their place as he comes into deeper 
deposits of other kinds of rock his inference that 
in successive periods different classes of bdngs 
inhabited the earth that their races suooesnvely 
became extinct that new species were suooesbively

produced and destroyed iu like manner nntfl tbe 
present order of animated beings was thus gradnallj 
introduced is a conclusion simply dependent on tlie 
very same grounds of induction guided by analogy 
as tbose by wbicb any of tbe most certain physical 
tnitbs are established 

the appearances in some instances of the imbed 
ding of organic remains may be those of a sudden 
destruction in others of a gradual deposition and 
covering up of the remains of many generations of 
animals dying in the course of nature and in vari 
ous stages of growth the beds containing these 
deposits are superposed to a vast number and 
often alternate with others in which no organic 
remuns occur it is from the consideration of all 
these and the like circumstances on every ground 
of analogy and by the most strict induction that 
the geologist arrives at his conclusion that to bring 
about these results involved a series of events which 
required a long succession of ages for their accom 
plishment 

again when it is remarked that this applies not 
merely to the destruction of a vast multitude of indi 
vidual creatures but to the disappearance of entire 
spedesf classes and orders and that this disappear 
ance is every where gradual the prpportiom of the 
numbers of one species discovered coexisting with 
another leing found to go through a reffddar oonse 
of diminution as we recede to older formations the 
same inference is further confirmed and extended

the inducnve method 

agdn the upheaving and laying diy from the 
domains of the ocean of any laige portion of land 
especially where it is destitute of all marks of for 
cible disruption or the apparent effects of sudden 
violence must by rational comparison be inferred 
to have taken place by almost imperceptible de 
grees avhen we combine these considerations with 
that of the number of superposed beds which obser 
vation of the varieties of mineral character as well 
as of characteristic fossils discloses to us and of the 
limited local extent of each we are necessitated 
upon the lowest possible computation consistent 
with inductive inference to assign an almost incal 
culable series of ages to each one of those successive 
deposits and strictly in the spirit of inductive anap 
logy to carry our inferences back to epochs in the 
depths of primeval antiquity in the history of our 
planet during which longcontinued dynasties of 
animal and vegetable life maintained their sway 
under circumstances more or less different from any 
which prevail now yet in all cases evincing the 
unbroken continuance of the same analogies in the 
structure and instincts of the animals and in the 
regular operation of the same physical laws in con 
fonnity with which the changes were brought about 
instances occur where a mountain mass beai 
evident marks of having been forced up from be 
neath while resting on its base the strata of the 
plain of a different kind of rock are observed per 
fecuy horizontal and undisturbed no one who it 



iwff 





jlfiiflilliitlliiiiiiirnl 



 evidence of physical truth 

disposed to consider tlie subject in a rational way 
can doubt that these undisturbed strata were de 
posited after the upheaving of the mountains 

again in certain other mountains a different set 
of appearances present themselves patches of 
superficial strata the same as those of the valley 
are found resting on the elevated parts and the 
strata of the valley also disturbed from their hori 
zontal position tilted up and inclined against the 
sides of the mountain no reasonable doubt can 
be entertained that these were deposited before the 
upheaving of the mountains and were carried up 
by the same action which elevated them 

comhinatiom of inductions 

the force of inductive conclusions guided by wide 
analogies is often immensely increased by the combi 
nation and converging to a common point of several 
different trains of investigation setting out from 
entirely distinct and remote origins yet all ulti 
mately and often very unexpectedly brought to 
bear on the same conclusion 

thus dugald stewart had acutely observed 
 the uniformity of animal instinct presupposes a 
corresponding regularity in the physical laws of the 
universe insomuch that if the established order of 
the material world were to be essentially disturbed 
the instincts of the brutes remaining the same all 
their various tribes would inevitably perish lilr 







the inductive method 

lyell extends this inference in a remarkable manner 
to the condition of the globe at a remote period 

 any naturalist he observes will be con 
vinced on slight reflection of the justice of this 
remark he will also admit that the same speciei 
have always retained the same instincts and there 
fore that all the strata wherein any of tlieir remains 
occur must have been formed when the phenomena 
of inanimate matter were the same as they are in 
the actual condition of the earth the same con 
clusion must also be extended to the extinct animals 
with which the remains of these living species are 
associated and by these means we are enabled to 
establish the permanence of the existing physical 
laws throughout the whole period when the tertiary 
deposits were formed 

geology indeed is full of striking examples of 
such combined inductions it calls to its aid the 
separate resources of many distinct branches of phy 
sical inquiry and from their united testimony col 
lects the materials of its conclusions 

thus the naturalist traces not only the invariable 
characteristics of species but also the peculiarities 
which mark the adaptation of species to climate 
he finds the characteristics belonging to a vrann 
climate in the fossil remains which the geologist 
submits to his examinatioil 

the astronomer demonstrates the effects of the 
change which is taking place with insensible slow

ness in the form of the earths orbit to be that of a 
diminution however slight in the mean tempera 
ture arising from the supply of heat from the sun 

while the physical philosopher aigues on the 
theoiy of central heat for the primitive high tem 
perature of the globe the meteorological geogra 
pher finds in the peculiar distribution of land and 
water on the earths surface a powerful agent in 
modifying climate the geologist infers from une 
quivocal proo£i that such changes in the distribution 
of sea and land have actually occurred and by 
successive local operations extensive and ultimately 
perhaps universal alterations have been accomplished 
in the relative position of the oceans and continents 
such effects have gone on in former periods by de 
positions and inroads by elevations and subsidences 
as they are still continuing to do 

how vastly does the mutuallyconspiring testi 
mony of these veiy different trains of research tend 
to increase the force of the inductive inference that 
the fossil animals and plants alluded to existed at 
incalculably remote periods when the present land 
was the bed of the ocean and when the surface of 
our planet enjoyed a higher temperature than at 
present and tliat from the changes of temperature 
and local conditions causes were brought into 
action which occasioned the extinction of some 
species and were favourable to the introduction of 
others of new idnds

caution in assuming analogies 

but even if in any case a particalar analogy should 
£edl if the clue should break if some unexpected 
and anomalous fact should throw into confusion our 
previously imagined arrangement still so powerful 
is the confidence inspired by what we do satisfius 
torily know of the permanence of natural order 
that we can never really distrust the stability of 
such a foundation for our reasonings 

if it be true that his particular analogy is over 
thrown the only £ur conclusion is that in this case 
our conceptions were too hasty not tiat the order 
of nature is violated the conviction that some real 
analogy subsists is in no degree weakened because 
we may have failed as yet to light upon it the 
certainty that there is a right path is not diminished 
because we may have taken a wrong one the only 
effect of such an occurrence on a truly philosophic 
mind will be the excitement of a still more diligent 
search after those characteristic circumstances which 
may indicate the true point of comparison 

we will illustrate this remark by a few examples 
 the earth moves from west to east all the 
primary planets revolve in the same direction in 
eluding uranus the same is true of our moon and 
of those of jupiter and saturn and the ring of the 
latter planet on the discovery of the satellites of 
uranus would it not then have appeared hit to 
expect that they would move in the same direction i

 evidence of physical truth 

yet in ct tliey revolve in the opposite direction 
but why should we thus extend the inference 
perhaps we feel persuaded that there must be some 
thing common in the nature of all the planetary mo 
tions nor can it be denied that such an idea is very 
natural the only fault is that the hypothesis is not 
comprehensive enough let us look at one other 
circumstance the earth jupiter and saturn have 
their satellites orbits very nearly in the plane of the 
ecliptic suppose we were to affirm that those 
satellites whose orbits are nearly in the plane of the 
ecliptic have their motions from west to east then 
our proposition would be completely verified for 
the orbits of the satellites of uranus differ from all 
the others in being almost perpendicular to the plane 
of the ecliptic we should therefore now have a 
very fair ground of inductive inference in supposing 
some connexion between the inclination of the 
orbits and the direction of the motion again 
there may possibly exist a relation of another kind 
the peculiarities of this planet may form a connect 
ing link as it were with other laws prevailing in a 
further series of planets beyond it or if it be the 
last in other systems beyond ours from such 
instances as this we learn no disparagement to the 
uniformity of nature though much caution in form 
ing our coiyectures as to its character no distrust 
of the existence of order and arrangement but only 
the necesdty for a just ground of probabili in 
tracing them

 we may addaee as another instance the case 
which has been fully stated and turned to such im 
portant purposes of argument by mr babbage 
derived from his own calculating engine con 
sidered here merefy with reference to our preeni 
subject it is perhaps one of the most remarkable 
illustrations which could be selected of the neces 
sity of caution and the most extended range of 
induction before we can satisfactorily establish the 
absolute generality of any conclusion 

the case is briefly this the machine being set in 
a particular manner will go on producing the series 
of natural numbers c and this may be 
carried to several thousands from induction the 
observer might then infer that it would go on for as 
many thousands more it in fact continues up to 
 the same induction would seem to 
render it next to certain that the series would be 
continued it produces but the next 
term instead of being will in fact be 
 here we might infer analogy is 
entirely broken and there is an end of all confidence 
in induction but when the calculation is continued 
it is found that now a new but still perfectly regular 
law of a different kind begins to prevail again at 
a further extremely remote period this ceases and 
another law commences and these all connected 
by another rule and so on without limit the 
fitult then was simply that our first induction was

too limited not that there was a failure in the real 
law 

 to take another example — newton made 
observations on the rate at which hot bodies cool 
and found a simple law to express how the rapidity 
changes as the time elapses this was deduced by 
induction but it did not extend beyond a certain 
range of temperature later observers went to 
higher temperatures and found the law fail was 
this then any disparagement to the real existence of 
same analogy or same determinate law this ques 
tion would receive but one answer from all who 
knew anything of physical reasoning and that 
answer avas speedily confirmed by the researches of 
dulong and petit who established a more compre 
hensive law applying accurately to all cases and 
which for lower temperatures resolved itself into 
the simpler law before found by newton 

 pliilosophers have been for the last century 
sedulously engaged in collecting observations on the 
direction intensity and variation of terrestrial mag 
netism various attempts have been made to frame 
some sort of theoiy to represent its laws but none 
hitherto with more than very partial success but 
are we therefore to infer that there really exists no 
fixed law or regular cause of the phenomena it 
is only a guiding principle of probability deduced 
by comparison with some corresponding class of 
effects which is wanting now the later dis 
coveries of electromagnetism suggest the analogy

of a series of currents and the idea of the globe as a 
vast eleetromagnetic or rather perhaps thermo 
magnetic combination which again is rendered 
extremely probable by the known metallic nature of 
its materials some theoiy of this kind is most 
likely to supply the clue which will ultimately con 
duct us to a systematic view of this curious subject 
 to take one more instance the extraordinaij 
parallelism which subsists between the phenomena 
of light and sound has led to a theoiy for explaining 
the most perplexed and intricate results disclosed by 
optical experiments 

two pipes pitched a little out of unison sounded 
together produce not a double sound but beats 
that is alternations of sound and silence two 
streams of light almost coinciding in direction 
produce not a double light but stripes that is 
alternations of light and darkness 

several distinguished philosophers had each pro 
posed theories which well explained some portion of 
the phenomena of physical optics but it was not 
until the above analogy occurred to dr toung that 
a general explanation was supplied which he named 
the principle of interference this doctrine how 
ever is only a branch and consequence of the more 
comprehensive theory of undulations which in the 
hands of fresnel cauchy and others has now 
afforded the perfect explanation of nearly all the 
most complicated phenomena of lights which obser 
vation has presented

there are however some phenomena which this 
theory does not perfectly account for the absorption 
of certn of the primary rays and not of others by 
different transparent media presents results of the 
most varied and apparently irregular kind for a 
long time they were considered to defy all attempts 
at theoretical explanation but even here a remark 
ably instructive instance of the value of philosophical 
analogy occurred sir j herschel brought argu 
ments from such analogies alone to bear on the 
question with the greatest effect and by a striking 
reference to a parallel case in the doctrine of sound 
which is perfectly explained by the theory of 
vibrations of the air as the cause of sound he 
demonstrated not that the undulatory theory explains 
the phenomena of absorption of light but that those 
phenomena however unexplained constitute no 
valid objection against its truth the paper inde 
pendently of its physical interest is well worthy of 
being studied by the intellectual philosopher and 
further a very recent investigation by baron von 
wrede has at least shown that the analytical prose 
cution of the idea thus suggested gives a mathema 
tical explanation of the general fact though its 
precise laws have not yet been determined so as to

rejection of pincipus foreign to analogy 

of this however vre may be most certainly con 
vinced that althougli in any particular instance we 
may fail in tracing out the real connexion of natural 
causes by this or that assumed analogy which may 
in itself appear very conformable to probability we 
shall assuredly never succeed by adopting any hypo 
thesis which is independent of natural analoes or 
foreign to them we shall never arrive at any satis 
factory explanation of nature or any real philoso 
phical truth by having recourse to other principles 
alien from those of induction nature must always 
be her own interpreter 

if we adopt hypotheses for example built upon 
metaphysical or moral considerations we may be 
certain they will never conduct us to physical truth 
whatever may be their merits in themselves and 
when directed to their proper purposes they are 
totally misapplied in physical subjects or rather it 
must be from an entire misapprehension of the 
nature and objects of physical researches that we 
shall ever be induced to connect them with such 
speculations

hypotheses often framed in utter defiance of all 
principles of analogy but a more just and rational 
method has since begun to prevail a method which 
whatever difference of opinion may exist on some 
points of detail must be recognised by all philosophic 
inquirers as sound in its principle viz that of rea 
soning cautiously on the fiuts from the hiawn to the 
unknown y the guidance of rationally adopted anauh 
gie speculations which in accordance with some 
formerly received views once passed current for 
sound geology were really such as altogether to 
discredit the uniformity of natural causes but the 
more closely we adhere to sober and legitimate 
induction the more will every discovery indicate the 
unbroken uniformity of plan which has prevailed 
through the immeasurable periods of past stages of 
organized life if says mr lyell instead of 
inverting the natural order of inquiry we cautiously 
proceed in our investigations from the known to 
the unknovm and begin by studying the most 
modem periods of the earths history attempting 
afterwards to decipher the monuments of more 
ancient changes we can never so hx lose sight of 
analogy as to suspect that we have arrived at a new 
system governed by different physical laws 

the necessity of proceeding on such principles to 
the utter rejection of all gratuitous suppositions or 
cherished prejudices is now becoming more generally

the evidence of facts b undeniable as to all the 
main features of the process by which the surface of 
our planet was gradually brought into its present 
condition the business of inductive geology is to 
compare the monuments of early changes in the 
earihs surface with those now in the course of pro 
gress and that this is a sound principle to proceed 
upon is assured to us by the circumstance that in 
the succession of these changes we meet with no 
interruption we witness such effects locally and 
gradually going on at the present day we trace by 
diligent observation the evidences of their having 
gone on in the same manner whether or not upon a 
larger scale in ages earlier than the records of his 
tory in the deposits characterized by the remains 
of organized beings of the same species as those now 
inhabiting the earth in the earlier beds where 
existing species are mixed with extinct until we 
arrive in succession at those containing none of the 
former and all of the latter class the continuance 
of the same set of appearances is tmbroken from the 
present time through those comparatively recent 
deposits up to those of older formation and 
though the authority of guvier was once appealed 
to as having inferred from the alternations in the 
tertiary formations of the paris basin that here there 
were interruptions of order from causes not apparent

and that the thread of induction was broken yet 
the later researches of lyell and others have 
explained those apparent breaches of continuity in 
the series and the investigation of those tertiary 
beds in all their varieties of organic characteristics 
has now become the principal source of evidence by 
which geologists have fully established the unbroken 
series the uninterrupted continuity of these forma 
tions in relation with the existing organized products 
of the neighbouring seas and the operations of now 
existing laws and whatever may have been the 
magnitude of some of the operations in remote 
epochs yet we find no deviation from the continu 
ance of action of the same kind no real suspension 
of regular lavs no simultaneous universal destruc 
tion and reconstruction of the globe but through 
the whole range of those periods of which we can 
decipher the monuments we have continued evi 
dence of the same system of gradual changes by 
which the existing state of things was by slow 
degrees evolved out of previous orders of existence 
such must be the genetal view of the matter what 
ever difference may subsist on minor points wliich 
will be upheld by the inductive geologist in contra 
distinction to the dogmatical assertions of the cos 
mogonist the chimerical yet fiivourite notion of a 
sudden total change of a catastrophe by which one 
world was suddenly reduced to chaos and another 
as suddenly called forth out of its ruins during any 
of the periods the records of which we read in their

missible inasmuch as it must be derived altogether 
from considerations alien to those of physical ana

testimony 

we find no period since the very commencement 
of all those depositions which contain organic re 
mains at which some portion of the earths surfooe 
was not abundantly peopled with an animal and 
vegetable creation more or less different indeed 
from that now existing but in all respects preserving 
an exact uniformity of plan and design and pre 
cisely and admirably fitted for the kind of existence 
which accorded with the then condition of the globe 
but destined gradually to disappear as those con 
ditions were changed and as other and varied forms 
of existence were in succession introduced the 
total absence of all marks of any universal sudden 
overwhelming convulsion supplies positive proof 
that nothing of the kind took place within any of 
those periods the monuments of whose duration 
we find in the accumulated remains of successive 
formations especially during any of the later 
epochs and least of all subsequently to the latest 
tertiary deposits that is within those times which 
can alone possibly accord with the received chrono

luductive character of geologtf 

in the illustrations above given i have enlarged on 
those selected from geology in particular ivith refer 
ence to objections often brought against that branch 
as if it were of a less strictly inductive character 
than others this i conceive is an idea which 
must totally vanish before the slightest real exami 
nation of the nature of the reasoning employed by 
any sound geologists though it may be freely 
admitted that most extravagant speculations have 
occasionally been obtruded on the world under the 
name of geological theories yet these the moment 
they are critically examined are found to be defec 
tive not merely in their details but in the assump 
tion of their first principles and the very method 
by which the investigations are conducted among 
sound and rational geologists whatever diflerence 
may exist as to certain theoretical views none what 
ever can subsist as to the sole recognition of strict 
inductive reasoning and the utter rejection of all 
other authority on which to rest their conclusions 

some persons have indeed been uigent in denying 
to geology the claim to be ranked among the esaet 
sciences and have appealed to the authority of 
great names in support of their assertion having au

the while a very confused idea of the meaning of an 
 esact science and imagining that when it has 
been refused this title it was meant to withhold 
from it the character of substantial physical truth 
and inductiye certainty whereas it is eyident to 
those who are but moderately conversant with the 
current scientific language of the day that the 
phrase exact science has been used solely as 
designating those branches of physical inquiry which 
could be brought under the dominion of tnathema 
tied laws and whose results could be exhibited in a 
numerical form and compared with theory by arith 
metical computation in this sense undoubtedly 
geology has not yet become one of the exacf 
sciences though from the nature of some recent 
researches on the effects of mechanical forces such 
as may be supposed to have acted in the elevations 
of the various parts of the earths crust it would 
seem to be fast approaching to the condition even of 
this class of investigations but at any rate this 
is quite independent of its claim to be received as 
among the most incontrovertible of those systems 
of inductive truth which have not as yet been of a 
nature to receive the aid of mathematical demon 
stration

objections to geology 

i have felt it desirable to dwell the more particu 
larlj on the stnctly indudite character of geology 
not only on general grounds but more especially 
because much pdns and some ingenuity have been 
employed to disparage and even deny the evidence 
of this science to some such objections wo have 
already referred and the rest arc not more rational 
or more consistent when refuted on other grounds 
their upholders take refuge in the convenient maxim 
that after all geology is but in its infimcy and as 
many theories once adopted have now been rejectedt 
 those now in vogue may be in their turn exploded 
or again they contend that the utmost extent of our 
researches lias not penetrated beyond the mere crust 
of the earth — how then can we pretend to draw 
such general conclusions 

if the science be in its infancy we can only 
say that it has displayed such vigour as already 
to have grappled with and overcome the most 
formidable attacks false theories have indeed 
been exploded but the order of advance has 
been regular and systematic the early cosmogonical 
speculations have indeed been discarded for the 
simple reason that they were not founded on induc 
tion but on some foreign principle or authority and 
therefore had no substantial or enduriug consistency 
a remnant of the same spirit however continued

to linger about the schools of geology and displayed 
itself in later times in the diluvial hypothesis and 
others of the same nature these in their various 
modifications have since gven way and for the 
very same reason because their foundation was 
defective it was based on some oilier authority than 
that of simple induction so the belief in vast and 
sudden revolutions in the state of the entire globe 
has been discarded the inductive principle is 
extending its triumphs and if all the phenomena 
presented by the observed state of the earths sur 
face have not been actually explained by the action 
of known causes yet many have been which were 
before not perceived to be capable of such explana 
tion and it has become generally admitted that 
this is the only sound method to be pursued in the 
endeavopr to throw any real light upon them 

in this way and in this steady course of advance 
from the hypothetical to the matteroffact may 
geological theories come to be successively modified 
but in no other those who make this a topic of 
objection must therefore prepare themselves to 
expect in the changes they may anticipate nothing 
fitvourable to any preconceived hypotheses but eveiy 
thing tending still more and more to take a direc 
tion entirely opposed to those fiivourite schemes of 
cosmogony which have usually prompted these and 
the like objections

obyious inference recoil on themselves if bj going 
only to this trifling extent we have succeeded in 
obtaining such a mass of evidence and substantiating 
such vast and overpowering conclusions what may 
not result when our inquiries shall be able to 
penetrate still deeper 

the introduction of imaginary systems of cosmo 
gony into geology is but an exemplification of the 
same fidlacious principles of speculation by which 
eveiy branch of physical inquiiy has in its turn 
been impeded and perverted it was in the same 
spirit that kepler believed the globe to be a living 
animal that tycho brahe feigned the sun with his 
attendant planets to revolve round the earth and 
that the equilibrium of the mercury in the baro 
meter was ascribed by linus to a suspension by 
invisible threads 

fde phiiosophtf from neglect of analogy 

the same want of inductive principles the same 
spirit of gratuitous theorizing which prevailed in the 
disputations of the schoolmen characterized in no 
less degree the speculations of descartes and his 
followers which in a later age took their place 
the main error which pervaded the whole system of 
that eminent philosopher was the adoption of a 
metaphysical basi on which to rear the edifice of 
phyhcal truui or in a word the introduction of

from the influence of the same canse even in 
comparatitely modem times it • required ai long 
struggle to divest chemistry of that chimerical iheoiy 
of combustion whose advocates imagined phlo 
giston — a sort of metaphysical something tbey 
knew not what which conferred on bodies tbe 
property of being combustible and was abstracted 
during the process 

in this recurrence to principles alien firom those 
of induction we find the radical defect common to 
the ancient as well as the modem scholastic theories 
this was the fundamental mistake whicb vitiated 
alike the system of the peripatetics and the hutchin 
sonians which upheld the crystalline spheres and 
the atherial vortices — the starry influences and the 
diluvial cataclysms the cosmogonists chaos and the 
philosophers stone 

it was to guard against such erroneous modes of 
speculation that bacon in bis novum ofyamm 
dwelt so earnestly on the principal sources of error 
which had arisen or were likely to arisen in philoso 
phical speculation from the neglect of those just 
rules and principles the several chief causes of 
mistake which lead men into unsubstantial and

is apt to raise as the objects of its adoration when 
it ought to be engaged in the sole worship of

discussion of those sources of fiilse philosophy the

philosophical inquirers of his day but as involving 
the correction of mistaken ideas likely to be perpe

examined his immortal work and it will be the less 
necessary for me to insist on them here since i have 
elsewhere placed them in a light accessible to the 
general reader 

i will merely remark here that the class termed 
 idola theatri seems to include the chief source of 
error to which i am here more esiecially referring 
the adoption of artificial systems founded on an 
assumption either of fallacious physical principles or 
of any whatsoever not physical the former being 
essentiauy false the latter however good in their 
own way utterly inapplicable to the purposes of

objections to physical inquiries 

it is from such an erroneous assumption of first 
principles that most of the prejudices and miscon 
ceptions against sound physical conclusions take 
their origin hence originates the chaige of pre 
sumjition in scientific inquiries hence the accusation 
of arrogance brought against the deductions of the 
physical inquirer especially if they happen to stand 
in opposition to the preconceived notions and che 
rished prejudices of mankind which are in reality 
far more presumptuous hence the exclamations 
against the pride of science and the hostility felt 
against certain branches of inductive knowledge 
while the objector is wholly blind to his own incon 
sistency in nevertheless accepting and adopting the 
conclusions of other departments which are yet 
built on the very same kind of evidence 

this has been especially the case with geology 
from illinformed or too oflen prejudiced persons 
we hear frequent remarks disparaging the inquiries 
and conclusions of the geologist while they allow 
and applaud the inferences of the astronomer and 
the chemist they condemn as visionary and pre 
sumptuous the results of the one as to the antiquity 
of strata and the successive oras of animal organisa 
tion the monuments of which are before their eye 
while they revere as unquestionable truths the most 
marvellous and paradoxical inferences of the other 
which refer to subjects utterly beyond the scope of

our arithmetical iower to conceive and to processes 
of nature which exceed our faculties to apprehend 

the mathematician in his study puts down a few 
characters and figures on paper and then confidently 
announces that the matter of which jupiter is com 
posed weighs somewhat more than onefifth of the 
average weight of the materials of the earth and 
that of the sun about onefourth 

the chemist asserts that a bell glass which 
appears empty is in fiict filled with a peculiar aerial 
compound and invisible and impalpable as it may 
seem yet is really formed of a vast collection of 
solid indestructible atoms and these of more than 
one kind aggregated together by the most perfectly 
regular laws and not only so but he actually states 
the numerical ratio in which they are so combined 
and what is more assigns the weights of these ulti 
mate molecules which no microscope can ever detect 
no balance verify such conclusions however are 
universally accepted and popularly held forth as 
among the most certain truths of science 

yet when the geologist contends that the crust of 
the earth with its organized productions has been 
gradually brought into its present condition by a 
series of creative changes going on through millions 
of ages his conclusion is condemned as chimerical 
and dangmms

hesitation the most inconceivable assertions of the 
astronomer and optician thej allow the full claims 
of the powers of the human mind to assign spaces 
and periods which transcend the flights of the loftiest 
imagination to halleys comet an elliptic orbit 
whose long diameter is miles with a 
period of years and to a molecule of aether in a 
polarized ray traversing a quartz crystal an elliptie 
orbit whose long diameter may be about oneth 
of an inch with a period of about one 
th of a second yet they talk of the arro 
gance of the geologist in pretending to maintain 
that millions of years ago the world was going on 
governed by the same physical laws which prevail 
now and replete with vegetable and animal life in 
all its varied forms of perfection and adaptation to a 
state of things of which the existing order is only 
one of a series of gradual and regular changes 

the true answer to such objections is found in 
the question what sort of reasoning will you adopt 
and allow in any such inquiries upon this the 
whole depends will you be satisfied with the 
same sort of evidence as that on which we ground 
any one of the best established laws of physical 
truth or will you contend that each branch of 
science is to be established on diiferent arbitrary 
principles from the others the very essence of all 
truly philosophic inquiry is to proceed throughout 
on one common principle of comparison and analogy

introduction 

in the foregoing discussion we have endeavoiired to 
trace and analyse the nature of our conviction of 
the truth and regularity of the laws which prevail 
in the material world we have noticed the natural 
tendency of our minds to generalize the intuitive 
belief in the permanence and uniformity of physical 
laws and the immense force of evidence with 
which analogy addresses itself to our conceptions 
these intellectual phenomena harmonise most acco 
rately with what we find by every experimental 



¦l r i aa l 



 nature of physical truih 

confirmation to be the actual state of things in the 
external order of nature and the certainty with 
which we thus rclj on the invariable truth of sound 
physical research arises from such a combination of 
concurrent testimony as to possess a force wholly 
irresistible even to the most sceptical and full of 
the most sublime satisfietction to every wellordered 
mind 

by the establishment of correct trains of analogy 
the inductive philosopher connects the near and the 
remote the minute and the immense the present 
the past and the future he argues from the laws 
of motion on the surface of the earth to those 
which prevail in the most distant regions of the 
heavens he reasons from the forces which act 
between the minutest molecules to those which 
connect sidereal systems he extends his deduc 
tions from spaces subject to measurement under his 
hands to the most inconceivably remote distances 
from oras of human date to the immensity of past 
duration he advances from causes which he can 
put in operation to those which affect the most 
immense masses from action in sensible space and 
time to that which belongs to molecules and pe 
riods of absolutely unimaginable minuteness from 
changes now in progress he infers those of past 
epochs and from the work of actual alterations on 
the earths surfiice computes the succession of those 
of which he traces the existing monuments in 
the midst of the apparent irregularities of the 



bmttlgmmusmeiimiahmimmiasmiaab 



cause and effect 

planetary system he traces order and in its per 
petual fluctuations the principle of stability and 
security 

physical analogies are not only allowable helps to 
the interpretation of nature but they are the sole 
legitimate guides the philosopher is not merely 
at liberty to adopt them as convenient aids but he 
is driven by the necessity of the case to follow 
them he has no other means of ever arriving at 
an acquaintance with the scheme of natural causes 
their reality alone constitutes what we mean by 
such order it is the uniformity actually found in 
certain limited portions of nature which leads to the 
presumption of its uniersality but it is under 
the guidance of that presumption that every step of 
physical inquiry proceeds and the universal confir 
mation of it is the general conclusion of all our 
researches and the further sound induction ex 
tends the more does every fresh inference add force 
to the claims of some high principle of order to be 
recognised as pervading all nature that induction 
can go on satisfactorily and successfully in eveiy 
new region of inquiry which may be oiened to it is 
of itself a proof of the permanence and universality 
of such order and qrstem 

upon the foregoing considerations we may per 
haps more correctly appreciate the standard of evi 
dence to which sound physical philosophy appeals 
and the importance of a dear perception of real 
physical analogies in the study of it we haveb 






 nature of physical truth 

however already remarked at once the difficulty of 
expliuning the weight which those analogies possess 
yet at the same time the actually irresistible force 
with which they impress the mind and if the 
evidence be thus in any degree open to difference in 
its application to different minds what does this 
amount to but saying that inductive proof does not 
amount to demonstration or more correctly is 
proof of a different kind but at any rate if it be 
allowed that there has been no attempt to overrate 
the evidence this will but give additional security 
to the important inferences and applications to 
which we shall advance 

study of cause and effed 

the more special object of the preceding section 
has been to examine the nature and principles of 
the inductive liethod the characteristic process of 
the baconian philosophy now the principal aim 
and object of this system is to ascend from indi 
vidua phenomena to general laws from sensible 
and visible results up to hidden and abstract prin 
ciples from the experimental evidence of sense up 
to the abstractions of mind from effectif to their 



in the present instance it is proposed to carry on 
the subject by the frirther examination of the nature 
of the relation of cause and effect and thifl more 
especially in the first instance with reference to the

causes which we trace iu operation in the material 
world the evidence on which our knowledge of 
these causes depends is that afforded by induction 
which we have already been engaged in tracing 
and inproceeding as we are now about to do to the 
more direct consideration of their nature we shall 
find that this discussion has not been misplaced 
and that in fact in studying the evidence we have 
arrived at some of the most important observations 
for bringing us to the apprehension of the nature of 
physical causes in tracing the essential grounds of 
induction it will be found that we have elicited 
what will be our safest guide in the inquiry into the 
principle of causation 

from the earliest periods at which intellectual 
pursuits have attained anything like a due place in 
the estimation of mankind a high rank has always 
been assigned to the study of the causes of things 
surrounded as we are by the most stupendous scene 
of natural wonders it would indeed be surprising if 
the curiosity of man were not excited even in an 
early stage of civilization to learn something of the 
nature and source of those effects which he daily 
witnesses in the magnificent phenomena of the 
material world and we accordingly find that from 
the earliest times at which the human race has been 
sufficiently advanced to give attention to such sub 
jects the inquiry into the nature and relations the 
dependence and connexion of natural phenomena 
has obtained at least some share of attention and

thougb pursued only by a few has conferred upon 
them at all times a certain degree of reputation 
even among tbe uniustructed rliile rith those of 
more enlightened ideas a knowledge of the causes 
of those effects which we daily witness has been 
regarded as among the highest objects pf intellec 
tual attainment and to be permitted thus to pene 
trate as it were into the hidden processes by which 
nature works has been esteemed the most elevated 
privilege of philosophy it is a species of know 
ledge of extreme interest and value in itself and 
embraces in its applications some of the most 
important and even momentous questions which can 
occupy human contemplation 

memwig of the tenn catue 

ik order to pursue our inquiry into the nature of 
physical causes it will be essential in the first 
instance to distinguish as clearly as we can the 
meaning annexed to the term 

in common language the term cause is used 
with considerable latitude of meaning and even in 
many discussions pretending to a philosophic cha 
racter a slight examination will show that it bean 
several distinct kinds of signification we are apt 
to use the tame ward and thence imagine that we 
are speaking of the same thing in cases which are 
essentially different though there is doubtless 
enough of apparent resemblance to mislead inaceu 



ml 






cause akd effbor 

rate thinkers into the notion of identity hence 
the ambiguity and fiiuacy hich prevail in some of 
the most important inquiries connected with this 
subject and the manifest necessity for attention to 
accurate distinction of the meaning of terms 

in ordinary affiiirs we talk of the cause of aa 
undertaking or the cause of our conduct 
again re speak of the cause of an historical 
event and we apply the term to matters of reason 
ing or belief in the conjunction because we 
mean the motive of our actions the ground or €f 
dence of our opinion the train of circumstances 
which brought about an event in history in these 
and the like cases we may trace a general analogy 
mhich has led to the application of the same term 
in all of them we refer to some sort of mond inlth 
ence exercised either by concurrent circumstances 
upon human motives or convictions or by human 
agency individual or collective upon events 

in the discussion of causes and effects as we 
contemplate them in the natural world and in con 
nexion with physical science it is more especially 
necessary to guard against the vague use of terms 
and in proceeding to the more precise examination 
of the nature of physical causes we may consider 
more particularly as a preliminary illustration in the 
way of contrast two fiuniliar instances of the use of 
the term cause 

we may say the cause of the motions of a watdli 
is the tendency of the mainspring to unwind itself

and the came of the flight of the cricketball is the 
toluntarj effort of the player these are two 
instances which would seem at first sight closely to 
resemble each other but when accurately examined 
we find an important distinction between them in 
the former instance we trace the order of depen 
dence of the motions from the index to the wheels 
from the wheels to the fusee and so up to the ten 
dency of the spring to unwind and this we refer to 
the property of elasticity whidi again may pos 
sibly depend on some still higher principle in the 
nature and arrangement of the particles of which 
elastic bodies are composed but to whatever 
extent we may advance in thus analyzing the effect 
up to its simplest elements one thing is all along 
manifest viz that the very highest principle of 
any such series must essentially be some general 
fixed inherent property of matter by virtue of 
which it is capable of being influenced in particular 
ways and by particular agents but yet is wholly 
inertf and incapable of arbitrarify originating any of 
the eflfects referred ta 

in the second case we may observe it is true a 
like series of effects in succession dependent one on 
another motion is communicated mechanically to 
the ball from the sudden action of the arm this 
results from the contraction of the muscles acting 
on the bones as levers the muscular contraction 
again maybe shown to depend on some peculiar 
influence of the nerves this again may possibly

cause and effect 

be traced to some higher principle we maj 
adrance in short as far as phjrsiological science 
can cany ns and thus fiur this and the former 
case are exactly alike but here at the com 
mencement of the whole train there most still 
be an influence or cause of some kind different from 
any mechanical power depending on vobmtary 
agency capable of originating the series of con 
sequences from itself acting by different laws from 
those of matter in a word an agency or influence 
of a moral kind or in the graphic language of sir 
j herschd we must include a distinct and 
immediate personal consciousness of causation in 
the enumeration of that sequence of events by 
which the volition of the mind is made to terminate 
in the motion of material objects i mean the con 
sciousness of effort as a thing entirely distinct from 
mere desire or volition on the one hand and from 
mere spasmodic contraction of the muscles on the 
other 

such a voluntary agency such an influence or 
power of which we feel conscious and which 
implies the action however incomprehensible of 
mind on matter is what we may properly dis 
tinguish by the term moral causation the 
former case we may call by way of contradistinctiout 
an instance of physical causation in the study 
of causes acting in the natural worlds we must care

fil observo this distinction cases where tolun 
taiy or moral agencj is concerned can onlj be con 
sidered in physical inquiry so fiur as they properly 
come under the lavrs of inert matteiv pr belong tp 
those kinds of physical action which are the subjects 
of dynamical or chemical research to go beyopd 
this s to confound physical causes witi moralt 
physicf science with metaphysical 

observing this distinction it woud o doubt tend 
much to the promotion of accurate views if we 
could succeed in agreeing to disuse the term cause 
in one or other of these very distinct cases but as 
custom has probably established the use of the term 
beyond the possibility of change we must content 
ourselves by insisting strongly on the careful and 
constant adoption of some such distinctive appella 
tions as those above suggested 

we have thus far merely contended that physical 
causes are such as are widdy disthyuished from 
moral but we have not yet considered what their 
essential nature is to this we now proceed 

nature of physical causes 

in the study of physical causes there has leen 
doubtless and still exists a strong tendency to lose 
sight of the distinction just laid down and from 
the £euniliar notion of moral causation tp imagine 
a similar sort of influence in the production of phy 
sical effects to transfer the idea of voluntaiy power

as experienced in ourselves to meclianical agents 
and by a creation of the fancy by a sort of personi 
fication of the powers of nature to invest physical 
trith the attributes of moral action but such 
indulgence of the imagination is here worse than 
idle it has a direct tendency to confuse and 
entangle the chain of reasoning and this considerar 
tion becomes of more importance in reference to 
the conclusions founded on physical inquiry on 
all grounds then we ought surely to keep the seardi 
into physical truth as free as possible from such 
incongruous influence and soberly investigate phy 
sical causes without being misled by the adoption of 
ideas so foreign to the subject 

yet notions more or less allied to these have 
been prevalent among philosophers this pro 
pensity for physical mysticism was preeminently 
fostered in the labtinths of the scholastic and 
cartesian systems of a past age but the traces of 
it have not yet been wholly or effectually banished 
from our schools of science 

even in later times many philosophers have 
sought to establish the notion of what they termed 
a necessary connexion or efficient causation in 
natural phenomena an idea which nevertheless it 
would appear very difficult distinctly to explain 

it would seem as if they regarded material sub 
stances as possessed of some hidden virtues or pro 
perties which confer on them the powers of physical 
agents and imagined these occult qualities the

secret soul which animates as it were the whole 
frame of nature 

in some instances the adoption of these ideas 
may be traced to associations arising out of the 
common use of metaphorical language we talk 
of the chain of cause and effect the links of that 
chain the connejnon of one event with another the 
dependence of causes the production of a result from 
its cause these metaphors being taken from mate 
rial objects insensibly lead many minds to suppose 
some similar real and effective union between the 
events but this is nothing more than the very 
common mistake of straining a metaphor beyond 
the points of parallelism in which it properly 
applies to others which are wholly incidental per 
haps we might rather say these metaphors them 
selves have been adopted and conceived upon a fidse 
train of analogy at any rate if we retain the use 
of them we should be careful not to be misled by 
the phraseology we employ into ideas at variance 
with the real nature of the relation intended to be 
expressed by it 

another source perhaps from which these notions 
of efficient causation have derived strength may 
be discovered in the vague conceptions which have 
sometimes prevailed with regard to the nature of 
mechanical forces we might instance some specu 
on the nature of inertia and the commu

with the questions once ajtated reqectqg the

the indistinct notions which freqnentljr intolre in a 
singular degree of mtery the advantage obtained 
in the use of the mechanical powers on wit 
nesdng the effects produced bj these contiitance 
the untaught mind can hardl help imagining a 
sort of creative energy which invests matter with 
new attributes and supplies a source of active 
power capable of almost indeiinite increase sden 
tific investigation indeed dispels the illusion yet it 
often continues to haunt both our language and our 
ideas relative to the nature of causation 



opiniont on the nature of causation 

whether however originating in such misconcep 
tions or not whether pushed to a greater or leaa 
extent some notions of this kind have prevuled 
very generally but reasoners of an oppodte bchod 
have arisen who aiming at a peculiar degree of 
precision and rigour in their speculations have 
utterly denied and discarded all ideas of such active 
efficient influence which they contend is altogether 
chimerical and have sought to reduce the whde 
nature and conception of cause and eflfect to the 
bare naked matteroffoct learnt from experience 
that some one particular event or phenomenon in 
nature always invariably follows another iu order of

time the former being termed the effect the latter 
the cause tliat besides this mere invariable se 
qmnce as it is termed they have no other kind of 
connexion or dependence one on the other all vre 
know or can know of the matter is the simple faety 
that such sequence does universally hold good aiid 
tliat we cannot reverse the order if we be prone 
to entertain the idea of any higher or more intimate 
connexion this they contend is only vague pre 
possession utterly inadmissible in exact philosophic 
inquiry 

against these views considerable objection has 
been raised often doubtless from the abuse of 
them because they were too exclusively dwelt 
upon or pushed to unwarrantable extremes in thdr 
application 

but apart from these objections the generality of 
inquirers seem to have felt miable to rest satisfied 
in a view of the subject apparently so little calcn 
iated to gratify the craings of our intellectual 
curiosity and seeming to conduct us to so little an 
extent into the secret workings of nature which we 
are so desirous to penetrate they have generally 
yielded to the seemingly more natural but vague 
persuasion that there is yet in the relation of cause 
and effect some real hidden essential eneigy which 
pervades and actuates all the operations of the 
material world

saj friction is a cause of heat the action of an

the ancients ignorant of gravitation considered 
 the moon to be the cause of the tides 

in such cases as these there is clearly the inva 
riable association of one fieut mth another hj a 
sequence in order of time tlius whenever we rub 
two substances together under all circumstances the 
effect of heat follows and in greater intensity as the 
friction is more violent it depends on this and on 
this alone in the strict use of terms then in this 
and the like cases our proposition is nothing more 
than the affirmation of this invariable relation of 
sequence as a result of universal experience 

in these instances then we have a precise exem 
plification of the doctrine of invariable sequence 
constituting the whole nature of cause and effect 
we observe only such an inseparable relation 
between the two fiicts we may doubtless imagine 
some higher principle to account for the production 
of heat in the one case and of colour in the other 
as the ancients might have imagined and perhaps 
did so a sort of principle of attraction in the tides 
but whatever we may imagine we know nothing 
when these and the like cases then are contem 
plated in a strictly inductive point of view we are 
obliged to admit that nothing is actually proved 
beyond the invariable sequence

a diffebence zoaj pcrhaps be traced between such 
instances as these last referred to and some others 
which we may adduce for instance when we saj 
that pulsations of air are the cause of sound it 
will be immediately felt that some relation of a kind 
more satisctory to our minds is here afsrmedtban 
in the former cases there is manifestly an intariahle 
sequence whenever this sort of pulsation is pro 
duced sound inrariably follows and never without it 

but besides this the propation of tremnloua 
waves or pulsations through the air is a mechanical 
effect of which we form a general idea apart from 
its influence on our organs and we refer the vibn 
tions produced in the membranes of our ears and 
the sensation which ensues as a particular case to 
the more general fact of pulsations of elastic media 
here then there is not othe sequence of one ftot 
upon another but also the former is inore ooare 
heiuite and includes the latter as a particular case 
of a more general class of phenomena

vrhich the ancients perceived between the moon and 
the tides to that view of the case which is now 
afforded us by the doctrine of universal gravitation 
acting between the sun the moon the solid earthy 
and the waters on its surfiice we arrive at a far niore 
generalized sortof relation we refer the phenomenon 
not only to an invariablo seqitence but asseirt the 
dependence of a particular eflfect upon a very enteral 
principle we mean that the tides are a particular 
case of the universal law of gravitation 

the same may be said of our assertion that elec 
trie discharge is the cause of lightning and thunder 
that volcanic action is the cause of earthquakes 
in a vast number of such instances what we really 
mean will be found to include a reference to a more 
general ct law or principle we niean that 
lightnhig and thunder are a paiiicuhr case of electric 
discharge or are reducible to that greatet principle 
an earthquake k particular case of the effect of volcanic 
force that is in all such cases we use the term 
cause to include the idea that the one phenomenon 
which we call the effect is a particular kifid of the 
other or cause which is the more general fact the 
relation is not only that of sequence but also that of 
a species referred to its genus 

when the suspension of water in the pump was 
firrt observed it was ascribed to a cause called 
 suction and in the then state oit knowledge it 
was not only natural but inductively correct to 
ascribe so singular an effect t a peculiar cause it

was apparently a case bui generis the efifect was 
perhaps soon seen to be of the same kind as the 
susension of a stone hj contact with the under sidia 
of a wet leather there was then one step tsikea in 
the process of generalization bj referring both to 
one common cause still named suction further the 
discovery of torricclli referred the former case to the 
pressure of the atmosphere and this was soon seen 
to include the exphination of the latter and all other 
analogous phenomena and finally this was redncbd 
under the still more comprchenare law of universal 
gravitation thus the gross and heavy matter of the 
earth as the scholastic systems considered it aiid the 
pure and ethereal substance of the atmosphere were 
brought under the common dominion of one simple 
and general law tlius the study of causes proceeds 
from the brst oxlmission of a peculiar phenomenoil 
as a thing sui generis until it is shown to be 
reducible to a species of some inore extensite 
established genus 

when a narrow beam of solar light twsses the 
sides of a wire or the edges of an aperture certdd 
coloured stripes or fringes are exhibited on a tereen 
placed at some distance these fiicts were at first 
ascribed very justly to a peculiar pneriy of 
light which was termed inflexion or sometiihes 
 diacuon 

the colours of soap bubbles or tose tietweeh 
two glasses pressed hard together were ascribed by 
newton to another peadiar property of light by 



 nature of physical truth 

virtue of which it has different characters altematel j 
at successive intervals along the length of the 
raj these alternations of character were termed 
fits 

some other phenomena of an analogous nature 
were in like manner set down as due to properties 
of light each entirely sui generis 

at length however it was shown hj dr younj 
that the j could all be reduced to a common principle 
or genus named interference before alluded 
tof and which supposed two rays of light capable of 
cither conspiring in their effects or neutralizing each 
other as they coincided at similar or dissimilar points 
or periods at alternate minute distances along their 
lengths and such a property was accounted for by 
the supposition of light consisting in tcaves propagated 
through an infinitely rare and elastic medium 

when a ray was transmitted through certain 
media or reflected at a certain angle it is found to 
have different properties alon its opposite sides this 
was a distinct fismt and was referred to a peculiar 
cause termed polarization 

when polarized light is received through a tom 
maline or other analyzing apparatus in a particular 
position it wholly disappears but if a plate of cer 
tain crystals be interposed a portion of the light or 
certain particular colours are restored this agaiot 
was considered at first a distinct property and was

called fqpolarizatiou it has been however sinee 
perfectly explabied by the general principle of inter 
ference if cojnbined with an explanation of polariza 
tion which is also easily supplied by referring it to 
the same general theory of waves 

the cooling of the earth at night is the cause of 
the deposition of dew on those substances which 
cool fastest from the condensation of the suspended 
moisture of the atmosphere upon them here the 
cooling or radiation of the earth considered merely 
as any other heated body is a greater or more general 
principle such also is the more rapid cooling of 
fibrous substances and such again is the suspension 
of invisible vapour in the atmosphere and its con 
densation on a certain lowering of temperature we 
are thus enabled to refer the particular instance of 
the dew on the grass and not on the gravel to a 
union of these more general principles here theot 
we have a combination of causes involving a fiur 
more satisfactory and intimate kind of relation 



true and hypothetical came 

this will be the proper place to notice an important 
distinction often not clearly kept in view we may 
refer to a cause or general principle which is like 
wise independently established by other experi 
mental evidence as something actually existing in 
nature apart from the particular cases we were at 
first considering

but also in other cases we may find some piere 
gratuitous supposition or hypothesis which supplies 
a connecting principle or general representation pf 
the hctsf though in itself purely fictitious such 
a principle is sometimes termed a causey as well 
as the fonder and such cases have been compared 
to the discoveiy of a key to a cipher obtain 
merely by finding from repeated trials that in point 
of bc it docs supply an interpretation an some 
writers have contended that this is all we want in 
inductive philosophy and would restrict the study 
of causes solely to this object the illustration 
however at best appears to me to convey but a 
miserable idea of the investigation of physical 
causes and if adopted exclusively cuts off he 
most valuable and satisfiictory subjects of physical 
inquiry 

newton at the commencement of the third book 
of his principiof has laid down certain rules for the 
study of physical causes the chief of these and a 
rule supported on the soundest considerations points 
out two conditions as the characteristics of legiti 
mate physical causes viz that they be such as are 
 truet and sufficient to ejcplain the phenomena 

now an hypothetical cause or the mere key to 
the cipher fulfils but one of these conditions 
nevertheless such hypotheses may be eminently 
useful especially when we can attain to nothing 
better with the reference to such principle we 
are often compelled to be satisfied they afford a

the pursuit of this inquiry soon discloses the 
evidence and monuments of successive changes 
which have occurred in the state of the earths sur

sound inductive geology recognises of course the 
same principle of referring to those which are both 
irue and sufficient to explain the phenomena we 
cannot find true causes except in such as are really 
proved to exist and found by experience to be in 
operation the action of the waters on the land 
whether the continued power of the rivers and 
ocean or the occasional force of inundations and 
torrents the subterranean foree of earthquakes and 
the external operation of volcanoes the contrac 
tions and expansions which must accompany changes 
in the temperature of any considerable thickness of 
the earths crust these and the like are the real 
causes to which the sound geologist refers 

the accumulation of soil at the bottom of the 
waters the imbedding of animal and vegetable 
remains in those depositions the elevation of por 
tions of land out of the sea are operations really 
and continually going on when therefore fossil 
remains of organized beings are found imbedded in 
rocks bearing also the marks of a similar mode of 
deposition we refer to such operations as those just 
mentioned as true causes to explain the phenomena

may have been effected yet no sound inquirer refers 
to causes of different kinds no one now dreams of

tract of country the geolost traces the marks of 
such sudden and violent local inundations in various

we have a real cause which explains theul and i 
in some instances the eflfects appear to have taken 
place formerly upon a laiger scale still we are not

posing submarine eruptions of greater violence 

thus while no difference of opinion exists among 
rational geologists as to the propriety of attempting 
to explain the facts solely by reference to true 
causes questions have nevertheless been and may 
fairly be agitated as to the frequency or intend 
with which such causes may have operated in remote 
periods and whether we should with greater probap 
bility lean to the idea of brief eruptions of enormous 
violence or of longcontinued action of ordinaij 
energy such questions are clearly matter of fair 
and philosophical discussion but the important 
point to be borne in mind is the distinction between 
such suppositions as those and speculations which 
would refer the effects in question to other agency 
of a different kind and which has not any connexion 
with the legitimate objects of inductive research

nature of physical truth 



the questions at issue between certain geolocal 
schools refer only to a difference in the degree not 
in the kind of action supposecl the case is essen 
tially distinct from any chimera of universal cata 
strophes and convulsive paroxysms 

volcanic action in a single day has been known 
to raise a hill of some hundreds of feet in height 
the elevation of a mountain peak of as many thou 
sands may b ascribed by one geologist to the 
sudden action of volcanic eneigy a thousand times 
as great by another to an equal force acting 
through a thousand days the probable reasoning 
in support of either supposition must be made out 
from concurrent circumstances but the important 
point is that in either case the theorist is not 
departing from known analogies and real causes 
the man who should contend that the volcanic 
appearance of the mountain together with all the 
marks of upheaving and disruption are delusive and 
that the whole was formed at once out of primaeval 
chaos exactly in its present condition would be 
fidrly divested of all claim to the title of a geologist 
or of a rational inquirer 

the question respecting the explanation of geo 
logical phenomena solely by existing causes seems 
like many other controversies to be in a great 
degree dependent on the meaning of tetmu it has 
been contended that we ought to appeal as much to 
unlimitedybrce as to unlimited time but it appears 
to me that the unlimited extension m time of the 



cause and effect 

operation of knovn causes is an assumption essen 
tially distinct from tliat of an unlimited extension in 
intensity this lost being precisely that trhich would 
place them beyond the limits of known and real 
causes it is undoubtedly true that we know causes 
only by their eftects and must infer the magnitude 
of the cause from the nature of tho effects witnessed 
but the ver question is whether we aro to derive 
this magnitude by the multiplication of the time or the 
force and unless where thcro is positive evidence 
of the suddcuncm of the effect from collateral circum 
stances the former is the method which alone seems 
to bring us witliin the dominion of known causes 

again even those theorists who have been most 
disposed to adopt the supposition of sudden and 
enormous luiroxysms of volcanic and diluvial action 
in the earlier stages of the condition of the earth 
have never supposed them as extending over more 
tlian certun limited regions of tbo earth at one 
time in ct all tho changes of which we have 
evidence in ast epochs have been manifestly kca 
and the operation of existing causes is confined to 
a scries of the like partial and local alterations 
thus no sound inductive geolpgt at the present 
day can admit anything like an universal simtdtaneow 
formation nor find support foi any theory of a 
sudden cosmogony applying at once to the entire 
surco of the present dry land one small portion

 nature of physical truth 

the course of profoundljacyusted chadges to be 
obliterated and overwhelmed ivhile another has been 
in progressive advance 

in all such cases then the observed fact or result 
is referred as a particular case or species to some 
real existing genus or class of natural operations 
and not left as a peculiar anomalous event m 
generis or referred to arbitrary agency 

causes whose existence and operation is evinced 
by experience are the true causes to which alone 
we can refer yet questions may fairly arise and 
indeed must be carefully discussed relative to the 
other condition of the case viz whether any par 
ticular causes so assigned are sufficient to complain the 
phenomena if they are not we then hjl back on 
the truly jihilosophical maxim so admirably laid down 
by mr lyell when we are unable to explain 
the monuments of past changes it is always more 
probame that the difficulty arises from our ignorance 
of all the existing agents or all their possible effects 
in an indefinite lapse of time than that some cause 
was formerly in operation which has ceased to act 

connexion of comes 

thus the consideration of a real cause in fact 
involves the connexion of one train of causes with 
another the cause is shown to apply indepen 
dently to one set of phenomena we refer another 
class to the same cause thus we enlaijie our ideas 



 ¦¦¦• lrj ¦ rij ji 



cause and effect 

of the connexion of physical phenomena we trace 
not onl j one series of causes and effects but many 
and these not independent but united bj common 
principles we perceive a union between extended 
orders of facts we find not merely one relation 
established but a communication opened as it were 
with a vast range of such relations and many such 
channels of communication widely ramifying in all 
directions the great truths of the natural world 
are proclaimed as it were not merely by the accord 
ant evidence of a few witnesses but of a vast num 
ber and with the increasing assurance too that as 
many more as we may summon will all confirm 
each others statement and this not merely in one 
or a few points but in connected trains of narrative 
and again not only in one or a few but a great 
number of distinct narratives all of which throw 
light upon and corroborate each other and the 
number and extent of which is increasing and 
accumulating without limit 

ideas of efficient causaticn 

by such considerations as those now adducedt it 
appears to me that we obtain a view of the relatim 
of physical cause and effect at once simple and 
satisfactory divested of mystery yet rising above 
the relation of a mere invariable sequenoe of 
fects we find the connexion of causes and eflfeeta 
in the connexion of laws and principles and in 



 v 






 



natube of physical truth 



the most strictlj philosophical view of the matter 
we rationally extend our notion of physical causation 
beyond the bare circumstance of two consecutive 
phenomena to the conviction of an intimate union 
between them which is no other than that of the 
particular individual case with the more general 
law of that law with some still more comprehensive 
principle and of this again in its turn with some 
yet more universal theory thus establishing not 
merely sequences but reasons not merely connexions 
but explanations 

we may thus safely admit that our persuasion of 
an intimate causality if rationally explained is 
really something more than the mere influence of 
an illregulated imagination improperly intruding 
itself upon philosophical speculation we thus suf 
ficiently account for the most powerful conviction of 
a hidden connexion between natural events which 
we experience even before the grounds of it have 
been distinctly analysed in the successively higher 
generalizations which really constitute what is so 
improperly represented by the conmion metaphor of 
the chain of causes we find a real and rational 
gratification of our longing anxiety to penetrate 
beyond the bare surfsuse of sensible phenomena into 
the more hidden relations and mysterious combina 
tions of nature 

if further confirmation of this view of the matter 
be wantinj we may find it in observing the depend 
ence which the strength of our impression of an 



tfmbdkmmmmakmdllmmriiriurfuhmmwim 



cause and effect 

intimate causality always has upon the extent to 
which wo trace the series of combinations of laws and 
principles 

tlio force of the persuasion we entertain of causar 
tion varies with the diflferent degrees in which the 
relations of physical laws are more or less general 
more or less widely ramified and dependent one on 
another more or less connected with high general 
principles and comprehensive theories our impres 
sion of the idea of an efiicient cause is much weaker 
for instance in the case of friction and heat than in 
that of gravitation and elliptic orbits or tides 

suppose we should hear it reported that some 
substance had been found in which no violence of 
friction would produce heat in estimating its pro 
bability prior to evidence of the fisust i believe no 
truly philosophic inquirer would reject it as a viola 
tion of the order of natural causes but suppose it 
should be rumoured that a new planet was discovered 
but that it did not move in an elliptic orbit i ima 
gine this circumstance would cast suspicion on the 
credit of the whole statement in the minds of all 
who understood the nature of gravitation 

or again suppose it should be stated that at a 
certain port on a certain day the tide did not occur 
rather than believe that there was actually no attrac 
tion of the water by the moon in that particular 
instance we should adopt any supposition of cur 
rents winds c or even rest in the mere possibili 
of some counteracting cause though wholly unaue 






rahrifirrjiikiivmriap 



 natube of physical truth 

to assign its nature as the more probable and 
rational idea 

we have a far less powerful persuasion of an 
inseparable connexion between the action of an acid 
and the red colour which it produces than of that 
between a high charge of atmospheric electricity 
and the production of thunder and the reason 
seems to be that in the former case we know only 
the bare law that such an effect is produced in the 
latter we know something at least of the reason 
why and the manner how it is produced in the 
former we do not know any intermediate step in the 
process any intermediate circumstance in the order 
of causes we have no succession of generalizations 
in the latter we can trace several for instance 
high electric tension always tends to a discharge a 
sudden discharge of electricity always produces a 
flash and a violent concussion of the air the con 
cussion of the air always occasions a report in our 
ears we could not imagine an instance where this 
ultimate effect was not produced without a violation 
of several distinct laws of nature in the former case 
only one law would be violated if the effect did not 
take place now so firm is our persuasion of the 
uniformity of nature that we cannot bring ourselves 
to believe in the capricious violation even of one of 
her laws we therefore are prone to regard the 
violation of several in succession as absolutely con 
tradictoiy and impoible 




cause and effect 



 



the study of physical causes has been by some 
writers disparaged and calumniated as of a low and 
confined character as being wholly limited to the 
bare investigation otads and as incapable of rising 
above such knowledge as is directly conveyed by the 
senses 

the view in which we have here contemplated iu 
will completely vindicate it from this charge it is 
manifest from what has been advanced that the 
study of physical causes even in the strictest sense 
involves the very highest abstractions the exercise 
of intellectual combinations of a nature the most 
widely remote from the evidence of sense 

we have traced a gradation of meaning from the 
bare laav that one phenomenon is invariably joined 
and coextensive with another up to associations of 
facts and laws of successively higher generality we 
assign cafises of a better and more satisfactoiy nature 
by assigning more general theories or systems of 
truths to which the particular cases or effects are to 
be referred 

in this point of view then the study of physical 
causes becomes identified vith that of the geneni 
laws of the natural world and it is here therefore 
that the nature of causation is found to be imme 
diately connected with that of induction by which 
alone those laws are elicited and established

to the contemplation of the wider generalizations 
which open to him as his view enlarges as he is 
continually rising to more elevated laws and loftier 
abstractions 

we recur then to the accurate study of inducthn 
in order to understand the ground of a rational con

the extended evidence of natural analogies the con

system of material things 

it is the combined force of many conspiring rela 
tions which tends to impress tiie mind with a per 
suasion of the intimate connexion between physical 
phenomena which we call cause and effect it is 
this support which each distinct truth ministers to 
another this mutual corroboration and confirmation 
of physical laws which constitutes the notion we can

we sliall thus e prepared to pursue the highest

demonstrate the immutable uniformity and recondite 
adjustment pervading all nature and the further

 belation of physical ciengb 

our knowledge of physical causes must be obtained 
it has probably been made sufficiently manifest how 
intimately the principle of inductive generalization 
is connected with all our substantial and satisctory 
ideas of cause and effect 

it appeared in the first instance that a belief in 
the permanence of uniformity and the preservation 
of analogies throughout nature is in ct the veiy 
soul of the inductive philosophy this supplies at 
once the first conjectural guide to our belief in fixed 
phyacal laws without which the veiy process of 
induction could not be carried on and the 
unlimited extension of it is the grand and universal 
conclusion to which all experimental evidence leads 
and to which all induction ministers increasing and 
abundant confirmation in considering further our 
natural persuasion of the intimate connexion of 
physical cause and effect i have endeavoured to 
explain it by regarding it as dependent simply upon 
the continually accumulating force of inductive 
evidence and the endless order and mutual depend 
ence of vast series of physical laws of successively 
higher generality and wider comprehensiveness 

having thus examined the nature of physical 
cansefl the extent to which we trace their influence 
and the origin of our ideas of a necessaiy connexion 
or effidency in them and having further considered 
the entirely distinct nature of what is commonly 
described by the same term canse — but which 
ought to be carefuuy distinguished in meaning when

thus used in the sense of fuoml causation the eflfect 
heing dependent upon volition or intelligence — it 
will become necessary to examine further what are 
the circumstances under which we can recognise the 
operatiion of moral causes f and what the evidence 
by which their existence is substantiated

evidence of moral causauon 

in pursuing the inquiry into the evidence we have 
of the influence of moral causes we have only to 
bear in mind the distinction at first laid down by 
the aid of which it will be apparent how the qpera 
tion of moral causes is distinguishable from the 
succession of physical moral causation as we have 
observed implies volition and intelligence it is 
consequently marked by the indications of intdli 
gence in the results produced in the illustratioii 
before given we supposed a known intelligent agent 
exerting a physical influence on matter if we 
witness only effects produced on matter how are we 
to recognise an unseen intelligent agent is the 
question now before us 

to recur to an illustration similar to that before 
employed — if a stone strike against an ogeet u 
may have been projected either by some merely 
mechanical power or by a voluntary agent and if 
we saw only the resulting impact and not the 
origination of the motion we should be unable to

decide which was the cause but if we saw a 
number of such projectiles striking the object in 
succession and all hitting it upon a certain mark 
we should inmiediatelj conclude that the projectiles 
were aimed at that mark and therefore that the 
whole was the result of some moral volition and 
further if we should see that the balls were impelled 
by the aid of a machine and should find that it 
was so constructed as to dischaige a number succes 
sively without the intervention of any manual 
agency this surely would in no way diminuh our 
impression that the whole was designed and 
originally set in action by an intelligent agent 
nor again would it make any difference in our 
conclusion whether or not we could discover any 
particular end which might be answered in striking 
the object though if we should perceive or con 
jecture such a design it would of course add a 
further confirmation of our original impression 

i on the contrary we perceived the balls pro 
jected at random at irregular intervals and in 
various directions we could not infer such design or 
intelligence in a word from results apparently 
capricious from effects uncertain and interrupted 
from action regulated by no seeming plan but of 
an arbitrary and inconstant character we could infer 
no design no volition no moral cause it is when 
results are reducible to regular rules when observed 
actions are found to be consistent with some fixed 
and constant system when phenomena can be

traced up to their determinate laws or in other 
words agreeably to what has been above main 
tained to their physical causes then and then alone 
it is that wo can ascend to the idea of a regulating 
moral cause and deduce the conclurion of super 
intending volition and designing intelligence 

in general then the evidence and stamp of moral 
agency and intelligent influence is found in the 
discovery of a tmifarm consistemy in the results in 
a regular arrangement of parts adapted to each 
other and to the whole such as to preclude at once 
the idea of caprice and chance and that of blind 
unforcseeing fatality and this may be distinguished 
into two kinds — ist where a fixed end is discover 
able and we observe the direction of means to it 
and changes taking place in furtherance of it nd 
where although no such end is discoverable and 
no change takes place yet we perceive things 
arranged in a certain invariable order and symmetiy 

in the study of the actual laws mechanism and 
arrangement of the natural world we have a magni 
ficent field open before us in which to pursue the 
inquiry whether such indications of moral causation 
can be traced and this inquiry is in fact in its 
most essential point already answered in the con 
clusions at which we arrive by inductive science the

physical causes is indeed not to be mistaken and 
it may be truly said that the sublime conclusions 
of natural theology in their general and popular 
acceptation are obirious on the most cursory survey 
of the natural world and at once convincing even 
to the most uninstructed apprehension unless 
miserably blinded by prejudice or incapacitated by 
moral perversion the most untaught mind instantly 
recognises the evidences of the divine existence 
and attributes and unhesitatingly regards the visible 
order and adaptations of the natural world as no 
other than the created manifestations of the divine 
perfections let us however observe that the 
special object of natural theology as a sdencej is to 
analyse the precise steps by which these conclusions 
are attained and examine the security of the ground 
on which they rest the preceding portion of this 
inquiiy has been directed in its proper way towards 
this object by scrutinizing the more general grounds 
on which all our ideas of the relation of effects to 
their causes depend and it is to the more particular 
application of these views to the great argument of 
natural theology that we are now to proceed 

nature of find causes 



at the outset of this inquiiy we meet with an 
expression veiy commonly employed but often with 
little attention to accuracy of meaning the con 
dderation of what are called if luif ontmei is referred 



to natuul mbologt 

to as the main evidence afforded by the study oi 
nature for the existence and perfectiona of the 
deity here uien as in other case it is to the 
niesiudg of the term that our attention must in tlie 
first iustance be carefollj directed now the pli 
cation of the word cause when we speak of final 
causes ia somewhat peculiar and in fact such as 
very commonly to occasion mistake and di£scui tet 
the phrase has been perhaps too stronjy sanctioned 
by custom to allow an expectation that it can be 
generally discarded even though we should gun 
considerably in perspicuity by adopting other ex 
pressions to convey the same meaning 

a few instances will serve to illustrate the use ctf 
the term — the circulation of the blood is said to be 
the final aiute of the valves in the blood vessels 
it would not be considered correct language to call 

iit the cause simply though by another modification 
of the word we might say that the valves are 
ii provided hecaute of the circulation we might easily 

n illustrate the distinction by abundance vi other 

 examples from all parts of the natural world 

 the variation of the seasons is said to be the 

ji fiwd cause of the obliquity of the earths axis the 

ji graminivorous or carnivorous constitution of iimal 

j ihjinal catue of the respective forms of their teeth 

j and feet the piunting of the image exactly on the 

 retina is the final cause for the lens of the eye

 a corresponding refracting foma whilst the fiinn

ation of an image free from colour in perfect eyes 
is the jlnal cause of the lens and vitreous humour 
having their dispenuve powers in a certain relation 
to each hj which in theoiy that condition will be 
secured 

in all such instances we in hcu use a veiy 
circuitous mode of expression in adopting the 
term final cause it was remarked before 
that in ordinaiy language we often use the term 
 cause to signify the reason object or motive 
influencing some moral or intelligent agent now 
when we consider the end or dengn in order to 
which one thing is arranged in a certain adjustment 
to another — when we observe things so adjusted to 
each other as to be able to trace manifest indications 
of such plan then we say of two things so adjusted 
that the one is the reason for the other that the 
first arrangement was made with a view to the 
second or that the second is the use end final retuofi 
or lastly yfno cause of the other we mean then 
a cause operating not in one arrangement upon 
the other as physical cause and effect to produce 
it or even to regulate it but in the motive or reasom 
of the intelligent agent who we infer contrived and 
designed the adjustment 

thus the term final causef ready implies no 
more than is implied by the term design in the

first instance ve find as mere matter of fact and 
observation in the order of nature a recondite adap 



i tation or fitness of all the parts of organized bdngs 

j and of all the functions of unorganized matter to each 

other we observe that every natural arrangement 
has its relations to other arrangements that every 
physical effect has its dependencies its uses its pur 
poses in reference to others we discover that in 
every such relation so universally and immutably 
 preserved some particular end is in fact answeredt 

i some particular object secured it is from the notice 

i and conviction of this bare matter of fibct that we 

 are led on to the further idea and belief of design and 

 intention that the end which we see answered viras 

contemplated that the object which we see attained 
was designed 

there is however another sense in which the 
same term final cause has been used by some 
writers which it is worth while to consider more 
 i especially as the confusion thus introduced has led 

to serious misapprehension of their opinions 

in some cases we may trace the dependence of a 
i phenomenon through a series of physical causes 

i md the last highest or tdiimate cause to which we 

 can thus refer has been sometimes called the juud 

i cause and where men have been unable or unwil 

i ling to investigate such proximate physical causes 

they have been prone to refer at once as an ultimate

resolve the whole into an immediate effect of the 
divine interposition we shall have occasion to 
recnr to some instances of this sort in the sequel for 
the present the following passage from an eminent 
philosopher will sufficiently exemplify the case — 

laplace observes 

 tons ics evenement cenx mne qui par lenr 
petitesse semblent ne pas tenir aux grandes lois de 
la nature en sent une suite aussi necessaire que les 
revolutions du soldl dans fignorance des liens qui 
les unissent an systeme entier de runivers en les a 
fait dipendre des causes finales on du hasard mais 
ces causes imaginaires ont ete suocessivement reculeea 
avec les homes de nos connaissances et disparaissent 
entierement devant la saine philosophie qui ne voit 
en elles que texpression de tignorance oil nous 
sommes des veritables causes 

from this passage it is manifest that the author 
uses the term final cause simply in the sense of 
 arbitrary agency or direct intervention or in 
other words employs the term final as equivalent 
to ultimate 

to add another remark 

the inquiry into final causes may fairly call for 
the exercise of much caution in distinguishing reoi 
cases of adaptation firom many which are but imk 
reid and fimdful farfetched and overstrained 
instances of this kind are sometimes urged where

no real or substantial indications of design can be 
rationally admitted and those who are bent on 
finding such evidences everywhere are too apt hastily 
to decide that one result was actually ordained with 
a special view to another where the connexion is too 
remote to allow us reasonably to consider it so 
such a course is apt to produce no other result than 
that of exposing to reproach the whole investigation 
of final causes and the judicious inquirer will per 
ceive at once the injury done to the truth by weak 
and delusive arguments adduced in its support and 
how little need there is for such doubtful aid in the 
abundance of substantial evidences with which we 
are surrounded 

use of final caue in science 

the only case in which there can be any reasonable 
ground for dispute about the use of terms is where 
they may be so chosen as to lead to ambiguity or 
mistake as to the ideas for which they stand 

now much discusdon has arisen as to the investi 
gation of final causes and especially whether the 
study of them be a legitimate part of the province of 
natural philosophy but all dispute may i concdve 
be avoided simply by attention to the precise meaning 
of the term 

according to what was above observed we cer 
tainly may agree to use the term final cause at 
simply equivalent to describing the fact of the

adjustment which we actually ohserve our meaning 
will then be totally free from all ambiguity but 
then this is only an inconvenient and circuitous way 
of expressing what would be more clearly and simply 
described by the plainer terms fitness arrange 
ment adaptation of things to each other 

on these grounds i agree therefore with those 
who prefer to discard altogether the use of the term 
 final cause and to employ in its stead only the 
plain terms acyustment c which express the 
fiacts we actually observe or inductively collect 

we should thus be relieved from all controversy 
about the introduction of final causes in natural 
philosophy since no dispute exists as to the pro 
prie nay necessity of considering those adaptations 
and arrangements in our physical inquiries which 
are in a great measure forced on our observation and 
without which our researches would be miserably 
defective in their most valuable instructive and 
important results 

in regard to the reasoning we should thus escape 
all danger of perplexing even in appearance the 
order and chain of it which is often greatly entan 
gled by the mere introduction of an ambiguous 
term by adhering to these more simple and per 
qpicuous modes of expression we should more 
palpably preserve that distinctness of meaning in 
form whicht at all events must be preserved in 
substance we shall keep clear the ifereneei from 
the order of physical causes and the study of the

causes tlionsdees in other words we shall not con 
found physical caitses with moral agenof but sludl be 
prepared in the only sound and legitimate way to 
deduce the indications of the latter from the 
former 

the term final cause employed in the sense at 
first explained as that which it must in strictness 
bear viz as involving a reference to the processes 
of creative intelligence is doubtless most improperly 
introduced into the investigation by which we 
advance to the elementary truths of natural philo 
sophy and manifestly for this reason that it 
expresses and thus misleads us into making the 
assumption of the very thing which it ought to be 
our object to pwve from the truths elicited by natural 
science viz the existence of creative intelligence 
of an omnipotent and omniscient creator 

but it has been contended that the study of final 
causes may be and has been of important use in 
physical discovery and the wellknown example is 
adduced of the discovery of the circulation of the 
blood by harvey in consequence of a reflection into 
which he mas led on the probable use of the valves in 
the veins 

let us keep to unambiguous terms and the case 
merely shows that a good conjecture derived from 
the observed fitness of the valves for such an office at 
would be discharged by them the circulation were 
a fact led him to the rigid train of analogy which he 
so completely verified by observation in this way

it is often the case in the researches of the naturalist 
that firom observing the obvious purpose of some one 
organ he is able to conjecture the probable use of 
some other which but for such analogy would be 
totally obscure and such conjectures if well founded 
seldom fail to be borne out by actual experimental 
proof 

the tucs of things simply so considered wherever 
they have been fairly traced and established supply 
a perfectly just and most useful ground of analogy 
for guiding us to inductive conclusions the habit 
of observing such adaptations in actual cases sug 
gests grounds of reasonable probability for expecting 
them in instances as yet untried and such conjectures 
in skilful hands are of the utmost utility in physical 
inquiries as we often noticed in the course of our 
former illustrations 

so long then as we confine ourselves to the 
ample notion of theyod of adjustmenu or use without 
reference to moral or intellectual causation we are 
not departing from sound physical analogies which 
we have before contended are the only rational 
guides in those coiyectures which lead to sound 
inductions 



the economy of causes 

another instance of the use of final causes in 
physical investigation on which much stress has been 
sometimes laid is the reference to what has been

called the lex parsimoniflc the economy of caasea 
or the principle that nature does nothing in vain 
or that the most simple means are aliys adopted 
for obtaining given ends or that several powers or 
agents are never resorted to where one suffices 
such a principle finds its use and application in aid 
of scientific research when it is taken as a guide to 
the more simple in preference to the more complex 
theory to known causes rather than imaginary to 
hypotheses already applying in other cases rather 
than new and arbitrary ones to analogies with 
existing and established relations rather than to 
gratuitous suppositions 

of this kind were the arguments from probability 
which weighed most with copernicus and with 
galileo in fovour of the solar system at a period 
when no demonstration had been attained and a 
more precise exempufication has been found in the 
argument for the earths motion in its orbit and its 
rotation on its axis being derived from one and the 
same primary impulse it having being shown by 
bemouilli on mechanical principles that one impulse 
would produce both and even the precise point of 
the earth calculated at which it must have been 
applied so as to accord with the existing motions 
and velocities 

upon this i will merely observe that the prin 
ciple referred to when stated in simple and precise 
terms is in fiftct nothing more than the announce 
ment of a great physical and inductive law the

evidence for which is do other than that of any other 
physical induction it is however highly important 
in our mode of enunciating it to keep it carefully 
distinct as an inductive conclusion from all manner 
of speculative assumptions for precisely as we 
have noticed in other cases it is in this way alone 
that we can consistently and rationally employ any 
guide to scientific conclusions when those veiy 
conclusions are to form the evidence of the truths of 
natural theology for the legitimate force of such 
arguments it is manifestly essential that we avoid 
making them arguments in a circle and that we do 
not assume the operation of the divine will in the 
process of reasoning hy which we seek to prate the 
operation of the divine will 

final causes in comparative physiology 

the question respecting the introduction of final 
causes into philosophy has been made peculiarly 
prominent in the controverqr which has subsisted 
between two distinguished schools of physiology in 
france to whose general views of oiganization we 
have already adverted the question with regard 
to final causes has in fiict been mixed up with the 
purely physiological question at issue between them 
from which it undoubtedly is quite distinct and 
ought especially in an inquiry like the present to be

carefully kept so lu the views whidi have been 
taken of this controversj re maj also observe that 
the tendeiunf ascribed to the respective opinions has 
had a considerable share in influencing the judgment 
formed upon them and has perhaps assisted in 
obscuring their real character which when dispas 
sionately examined seems to me by no means such 
as to justify the strong censure of the one and pre 
ference of the other which has been sometimes 
expressed 

cuvier and his followers have insisted strongly on 
the propriety of pursuing physiological examination 
upon the assumption that every part of the organ 
zation of an animal must have some me and that 
then by comparison of one part with another we 
should proceed to trace tjie paflicular use and inten 
tion of each organ and so advance to our conclu 
sion as to the nature of the animal and its place in 
the scale of creation cuvier specifically states this 
principle of what he terms the conditions of 
existence as equivalent to what are commonly 
called final causes and speaks of the combinatioii 
of organs adapted to the part which the animal has 
to play in nature and in aflsrming this cuvier 
has but extended and followed up the method of the 
most distinguished of his predecessors who have 
generally regarded this adaptation of parts in oiga 
nized structures as not only an inference deduced 
from all researches but a sure guide in further 
investigations 




¦¦¦••¦jr ¦ ¦ i ¦i

to these yiews the advocates of theory of unity 
of composition or analogues have been strongly 
opposed geoioy st hilaire while he confesses 
that it is very difficult for the most cautious man 
never to have recourse to final causes in his expla 
nations yet agrees with bacon in considering them 
as sterile and expressly observes i take care 
not to ascribe any intention to grod for i mistrust 
the feeble powers of my reason i observe hct 
merely and go no further i only pretend to the 
character of the historian of what is i cannot 
make nature an intelugent agent who does nothing 
in vain who acts by the shortest mode who does 
all for the best and again remarks upon the 
beforequoted expression of cuvier i know 
nothing of animals who jiave to play a part in 
naturef he has also illustrated his ideas still fur 
ther by the remark that when it is stated for 
example that fishes have certain locomotive powers 
because they are destined to live in the water by 
the same reasoning you would say of a man who 
makes use of crutches that he was originally des 
tined to the misfortune of having a leg paralyzed or 
amputated 

let us merely in these cases as in others look 
to the correctness of our reasonings if we be really 
aiming at a sound analysis of the evidences of truth 
let us but guard against the manifest error of

for granted the thing to bo proved if in 
logical as in any other inqnirj we set ont by 
asiuminy design intention or in a word a moral 
cohse then it is clear that any inference we may wish 
to draw in support of the truth of natural theology 
is vitiated and nullified considered therefore as 
taken in the correct order of reasoning the caution 
expressed by gcofoy st hilaire appears to me 
strictly just and the censure vhich has been cast 
upon it undeserved if he did set out by ascribing 
intention to the deity he could not arrive at any 
proof of such intention the reason indeed which 
he assigns of mistrusting his feeble powers 
appears to me to be a wrong one it should rather 
be that all reasoning would thus be lost and all its 
steps confounded together but as a physiologist 
as supplying the materials for the conclusions of 
natural theology he is undoubtedly right in assuming 
solely the character of the historian and seeking 
only bare facts and laws that he may from hem 
elicit the great inferences to which they lead to 
assume the economy of causes to make nature 
an intelligent agent in the outset would be to 
anticipate the conclusion if the idea itself do nof 
involve an entire confusion of thought to assign 
to animals a part to play before we have traced 
their analogies is surely premature in the order ot 
just reasoning if by that expression anything more 
be meant than the mere guiding coigectuie which 
the structure of their organs may suggest

it is equally true that the habit of making such 
assumptions even tacitly is difficult to avoid be 
cause when proofs have already largely accumulated 
we are of course prepossessed with the conclusion 
which we suppose the further instances must also 
substantiate but when our avowed object is the 
exact discrimination of evidence as such anid the 
strict analysis of our impressions into their logical 
elements the distinctions must be studiously kept 
in view 

the illustration of the man on crutches has been 
blamed as idle and unbecoming it does not appear 
to me deserving of censure in this vay though i 
think it inapplicaue as being an argument upon an 
isolated and accidental case the essence of such 
reasoning consists in its extension to entire species 
and classes of beings in their natural relations at 
all events whatever may be thought of the parti 
cular illustration ilie same remark must be still 
applied with regard to any assumption of designing 
moral agency in the adaptation 

let us in such reasoning only bear in mind these 
obvious distinctions let us not allow physical 
investigation to borrow from natural theology if it 
is to furnish the very means of support to divine 
truth let not natural theology be made to 
minister to science if science is to be the hand

at the outset they are recognised and bear an 
essential part even in the strictest logical analysis

logical topics referred to we may iurly adopt as 
the evidence may seem to warrant either the prin 
ciple of analogues or of the use of oigans this 
latter being carefully distinguished in meaning from 
any idea of moral causation but these or other 
equivalent physiological ilieories must be taken

pensable as our guides in considering any new case

 considered as so much opposed especially in their 
bearing upon the conclusions of natural theology do 
not upon closer examination appear to present any 
thing really at variance without pretending to 
form an opinion on their respective merits consi 
dered physiologically i will merely observe this 
much both systems tend equally to establish the 
existence of profomidly adjusted order and unifor 
mity in nature though of somewhat different kinds 
the one system contemplates the entire range of 
animated beings and unveils to the welldirected 
eye of the physiolot the most marvellous preserva 
tion of exact analogy even throughout the most 
apparently trackless mazes of dissimilarity the 
other without taking this wide range yet establishes 
the same truth within more limited and detached 
portions of the field of inquiry and thin those 
several limited portions enlarges greatly our percep 
tion of the combination of acyustments in which the 
same great principles are manifested 

the one theory dwells on the relations and adap 
tations of whole classes and orders of animated 
structures to each other the other on the relations 
and adaptations of the several parts of one animated 
structure to each other and to the purpose of the 
preservation and wellbeing of the whole the one 
leads us to consider the more abstract analogies 
which connect together the various parts of animtf 
nature by general laws the other the more practical 
relations and mutual subserviency of the parts of 



ii j rttlirj il ¦¦ i f r l ll tj r

organic structures to tbe purposes of animal exis 
tence the one shows a vast and perfect compo 
sition an elaborate and systematic design presented 
to our contemplation the other a profoundly inge 
nious and complicated machine set in action 

now if we consider the bearing of these views on 
natural theology it must i think be admitted that 
they both though in somewhat different ways tend 
equally to substantiate the great inference of design 
in the universal preseration of systematic order 
susceptible of exact classification bj pervading ana 
logies there is just the same indication of design and 
intelligence as in the adaptation and adjustment of the 
parts of any individual machinery to an end 

an elaborate design of art a wellpropordoned 
edifice a magnificent painting though addressing 
themselves solely to our contemplation in their silent 
and immovable iroportions are surely quite as 
forcible manifestations of intellect and genius as the 
most skilfully contrived piece of machinery in inces 
sant activity fabricating the most useful productions 

either way then in the study of nature there is 
an equally clear manifestation of that infinite intel 
ligence which after the inductive examination of the 
laws or adjustments in cither case we are directly 
led to acknowledge as the irresistible conclusion 
and as this is the case with either species of inves 
tigation singly so will it be more preeminently tme 
when both are pursued jointly as they assuredly may 
be without the smallest detriment to each other or

confusion of first principles provided only we keep 
strictly to the simplest rule of all just reasoning and 
do not confound our final conclusion with our first 
assumption 

the highest philosophy is most disposed to cherish 
a readiness to perceive and admit the fiiir indications 
of design and intelligence in whatever form they may 
present themselves and there is a wider expansion 
given to our views when we thus include the con 
templation of order and symmetry even though we 
perceive not their end or object in our notion of 
design in such considerations we may find the 
loftiest exercise of truly philosophical reflections 
we shall realize the highest aim of scientific specu 
lation and shall recognise the truth of the remark 
so forcibly expressed by dugald stewart — there 
is a certain character or stjfle if i may use the 
expression in the operations of divine wisdom 
something which evcrwhere announces amidst an 
infinite variety of detail an inimitable unity and 
harmony of design and in the perception of which 
pkuoiopfiical wgacity and genius seem chiefly to 
eonsistv 



example — botaniad symmetry 

there are few branches of science firom which we

and modification of organized structurefl uimn from

in the classification of plants alone whether on mn 
artificial or a natural system vre trace the clearert 
indications of this pervading principle but so little 
is the bearing of it perceived that nothing is more 
common than to hear ridicule cast on the empcinesfl 
as it is considered and pedantry of scientific nomen 
clature and systematic arrangement those vdio 
ignorantly indulge in this kind of censure are little 
able to understand how much even this mere classi 
fication implies had it no other use the mere hct 
of an unfailing reduction of each individual and each 
species to its place in a system is itself an nnqne 
tionable and obvious indication of plan and desigii 
in the organization of those individuals and species 
the system may be artificial and complex the 
nomenclature may seem dry technical and pedantic 
but the existence of order is real and the intariable 
adherence to a certain determined set of types and 
forms is nothing less than one of the most dedsive 
evidences of that pervading uniformitj throoghoat 
nature which is the legitimate manifestation of one 
presiding intelligence 

but nowhere perhaps in the compass of this sci 
ence is the truth of our position more angolaily 
confirmed than in the remarkable fiict obserred by 
botanical physiologists of the existence of iaortim 
yet always symmetrical parts in plants the solgeet 
has been touched upon in immediftte connexian with 







lyi tl¦j¦aavawfclr 



 relation of phtsioal sdencb 

oar present application of it bj dr daubenj in his 
inaugural lecture on botany and i cannot better 
contcj an idea of it than in his own words — 

 we find parts existing in a rudimentary or abor 
tite state in one species which in others serve some 
manifestly important office neither would it be any 
objection to the idea of design if it could be proted 
that in this rudimentary condition they were abso 
lutely useless although it must be considered an 
additional proof of arrangement when as in many 
instancec we are able to show that they become sub 
servient to a new purpose by being unfitted to their 
primary one 

after jiving some instances of these occasional 
transmutations of function and character the author 
observes distinctly that apart from this the exis 
tence of these abortive organs in a regular symmetiy 
is alone an indication of design and quotes in sup 
port of his view the following remarkable illustration 
from m de candoue — 

 if on a subject so grave and elevated i may be 
permitted to avail myself of a comparison somewhat 
mean and trivial i may perhaps render my views 
on this subject somewhat better understood 

 j will suppose that i am seated at a splendid 
banquet and certainly the repast which nature sots 
before us may well merit this appellation 

 i endeavour to discover what evidence can be 

•p

afltorded that this banquet is not the result of chance 
but has been due to the will of an intelligent being 
no doubt i should remark that each of the dishes is 
in itself well prepared this is the argument of the 
anatomist and that the selection of them implies a 

r 

reference to the wants of the individuals who partake 
of it this is the reasoning of the physiologist 
but may i not likewise obserte that the dishes that 
constitute this repast are arranged in a certain sym 
metrical order such as is agreeable to the eye and 
plunly announces design and volition 

 now if on examining the above arrangement i 
should find certain dishes repeated as for instance in 
double rows for no other apparent reason than that 
the one might in a manner correspond to the other 
or observe tliat the places which they should occupy 
were filled with imitations of the real dishes which 
seem of no use with reference to the object of the 
repast ought i on that account to reject the idea of 
design 

 so far from this i might infer from the very 
circumstances stated an attention to synmietrical 
arrangement and consequently the operation of 
intelligence 

now this is precisely what happens on the great 
scale in nature considerations derived from the 
symmetiy of parts correct in great measure what 
is deficient in the theory of final causes and tend 
not only to resolve many difficulties which present 
themselves in the general economy of nature but 



¦ tv 



t w ¦ p ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦¦ 



 relation of physical science 

even to transform them into evidences of the exis 
tence of this very order 

i will not injure the force and beauty of this illus 
tration bj any comment the conclusion appears to 
me irresistible that symmetiy of arrangement is as 
decided a jiroof of design as adjustment of mechar 
nism — beauty and harmony as clear indications of 
mind as combination of mechanical action 

examples from physiology 

few parts of the oiganized body were more com 
pletely involved in obscurity as to their nature and 
functions than the nervous system until of late 
years by the united labours of sit charles bell 
m magendie and mr herbert mayo a valuable 
light has been shed upon the subject 

all parts of the body over which we have any 
control are found to be furnished with two distinct 
sets of nerves every part has also as we well 
know two distinct powers or functions one passive 
or that of sensation the other active or that of 
voluntary motion of the two sets of nerves one 
invariably gives the first power the other the 
second 

this recondite distinction of use and properties 
so undeviating in the midst of the greatest apparent 
complexity is surely a striking instance of the most 
beautiful harmony between the distribution of the 
oigans and the corresponding functions though vre

perceive no mechanical principle of contritance nor 
in the ordinaiy sense any reason for the twofold 
system of nerves 

but these researches have been carried further 
at first sight nothing would seem more devoid of 
order or method than the arrangement of the origins 
of the respective sjrstems of nerves mr h mayo 
however has succeeded in reducing the apparent 
confusion to a simple system he has made out the 
general law of distribution that the nerves of motion 
have their roots in the same part or segment of the 
nervous centre as the corresponding and accom 
panying nerves of sensation 

the same physiologist has pursued the subject 
more recently and has deduced many curious results 
especially involving the confirmation of the pro 
found anticipations of dr vhytt which are 
remarkable as tending to simplify and reduce to a 
common principle the instances of many motions 
and affections which have been regarded as involun 
tary of which we seem unconscious but which yet 
are really results of volition though overlooked from 
habit the consideration of probability and analogy 
derived from the simplicity of nature was here the 
guiding principle which led the author to his 
inferences and which is so beautifully confiimed

the cases last referred to afford good examples of 
a simplification of principle which may be fidrly 
urged as a proof of presiding intelligence in the 
arrangement of the organized body though we see 
nothing but the indications of this sjrmmetry and 
order and no positive perception of a use or end 
answered to look only to such purposes or prac 
tical contritances is to take far too narrow a view 
of final causes we should leam to trace design 
equally perhaps even more clearly in cases where 
we perceive no end or practical design but where 
the influence of ordaining intelligence is displayed 
solely in the continually increasing simplicity of 
principle and symmetry of arrangement which are 
constantly opening upon us in every successive 
advance of discovery 

it has been admirably observed by the distinguished 
physiolost just referred to as philosophy advances 
the properties of matter are perpetually found to be 
fewer and simpler which the creative wisdom so 
combines and directs as to produce the most diver 
sified and at first sight opposite results the 
disclosure of such a jrinciple alone seems to me to 
constitute the highest kind of proof of presiding and 
ordaining intelligence i have above referred to 
some instances in support of it but i must here 
add one more case which places the argument in 
a peculiarly striking point of view derived from the

researches of modem physiology and which i 
cannot express better than in the words of the same 
author — 

one common commencement is there for the 
development of all the families of vertebral animals 
there is a period after its commencement when the 
frame in outline being already distinct the class 
even of the individual is indistinguishable whether 
it be fish reptile bird mammiferous animal or even 
man for a time these all march parallel alike in 
all things the highest not differing from the lowest 
for example the fish the lowest in the scaler is 
formed to breathe the waters for this purpose in 
its throat there must be openings made to give 
passage to the water through its gills these open 
ings are called branchial apertures the reptile has 
no need of these openings but they are formed in 
it in the bird they would serve no use but they 
are there in the mammiferous animal again in 
man they are useless but they are still present 
respiratory apertures in the neck with a single 
heart and a corresponding distribution of the aorta 
form the early undistinguished and undistingnishing 
type stamped on the whole range of vertebrata 

 but now a difference begins this character of 
organization is to be permanent in fish in fish 
therefore it now expands and amplifies itself at 
the corresponding period in the higher ftnimali it

fades and disappears shrinking while a higher order 
of organization supersedes it and parts are developed 
which in the fish appear not this hiw holds 
throughout the economy there is one common 
type for the brain at its first production which 
remains permanent in the lowest tribes but is 
improted upon by fresh developments in each above 
thus the brain of man at first resembles that of a 
fish then of a reptile and bird finally it becomes 
the mammiferous brain then human 

on contemplating so truly astonishing a train of 
development as is here unfolded the reflection 
which presents itself to the mind may in the first 
instance be very different from that which is 
induced on a more enlarged consideration of the 



in the gradual stages of the process here unveiled 
we perceive organs bestowed apparently without 
discrimination as to the future destiny of the crea 
ture adapted in many to no perceptible end in 
fact positively useless and superfluous all notion 
of final causes seems excluded and all idea of 
ajustment to a purpose violated even the sup 
pression of a useless organ and the substitution or 
superinduction of one which is useful seems a 
circuitous and unnecessarily complex process of 
obtaining the end ultimately accomplished 

but when we look at the regularity of the sjfstem 
on which all this is planned when we conrider that 
these useless or abortive organs are in ad caooi

constructed on one simple model mrhen we obserre 
the precise order in which thej disappear exactly in 
accordance with the destined diflference of function in 
the different species when we trace the undeviating 
scheme on which the new modifications are respeo 
tiyelj superinduced when we regard the deter 
minate scale according to which the whole process 
is unalterably carried on — then we shall be urged 
with an increasing and accumulating force of con 
viction to the conclusion that all this arrangement 
however apparently complex is in reality an asto 
nishing instance of conformity to laws of the most 
recondite simplicity that every step in the process 
however apparently superfluous is in strict accord 
ance with a great principle of uniformity that every 
stage in the transformation however in first appear 
ance destitute of direction to a purpose of utility 
yet if it answer no other has its direct application 
in filling up a place in the universal harmony and 
incomparable unity of design which pervades all 
organized nature the very singularity of the pro 
vision well considered evinces the enlarged pre 
servation of analogy the very objection and difficulty 
of the case is converted into an evidence in favour

the distinction which has been before drawn be

of cause and efiect may tend in no small degree to 
remove a difficulty sometimes felt in the estimate of 
the proofs of creative wisdom and power supplied 
by the contemplation of organized life as compared 
with those derived from the study of the heavenly 
bodies in the former case the production of 
animal and vegetable life is observed to be always 
in connexion with a proximate material cause in 
the latter we can conceive no material cause of the 
existence and motions of the planetary system

pbenomena do not furnish to some minds at least 
the same conclusive evidence of a deity as the 
latter 

now when the nature of physical or material 
causes is distinctly understood according to the view 
we have here taken of it it becomes evident that 
the material or physical agency which is referred to 
in the production of organized life is nothing more 
than the scries of laws to which we are able to 
reduce those processes of nature we trace an 
invariable course of sequence and dependence of one 
phenomenon or effect upon another of a more general 
kind we can follow up these trains of conse 
quence through a considerable number of step and 
thus perceive a connected series of laws impressed 
upon the functions of material and organized beings 
in the case of the heavenly bodies we cannot do 
this at least with reference to the origination of 
their motions or adjustment of their masses and 
distances the difference then is solely that we 
can trace a longer series and a more complicated 
system of physical laws in the one case than in the 
other and therein it would seem to follow a greater 
rather than a less manifestation of design and intel 
ligence in the former case in neither do we arrive 
at any efficient causation or moral agency but by 
carefully establishing the material indications of it

tbat vre are able to trace those indications the

matter into its existing combinations we recognise

jut and sober inductive science applied to the 
examination of the actual structure of the earths 
crust enables us with satisfaction and certainty to 
trace the changes which have taken place on the 
surfiu of a globe possessing the same nature as the 
existing earth and in the structure and habits of 
oiganized beings analogous to those now inhabiting 
the world it investigates the alterations which 
have been effected by physical agents resembling 
those now in operation and in accordance with 
general laws the same as those now recognised in 
the economy of nature 

but it does not and cannot rise to the disclosure 
of what occurred under a different state of things or 
owing to the action of causes of a different order 
from those now discovered by physical research it 
cannot show a chaos or trace the evolution of a 
world out of it it cannot reason upon a supposed 
state of universal confusion and ruin and the imme 
diate reduction of it into order and arrangement

it can investigate the changes of things but not 
their origin in a irord sound geology vrill never 
aspire to the character of cosmogonj 

greology is indeed preeminently distinguished 
from other branches of physical science in this that 
while they teach us only the existing order of nature 
this carries us back in time and shows a period 
when the present races of organized beings did not 
exist and by consequence establishes the fact of a 
creation that is more properly of a series of crea 
tions and these manifestly not brought about at 
any one marked period or extending to all animated 
nature at once but by the slow and gradual intro 
duction of each new species as the older disappeared 

the successive strata are the sepulchres of succest 
sive races of organized beings diftering more or less 
from existing siecies and those of the least anti 
quity containing extinct species coexistent with 
those now tenanting the globe and bearing decisive 
evidences of progressive local gradual deposition 
and elevation the marks of sudden violence in 
deed are occasionally seen in all formations but 
their occurrence is the exception not the rule and 
in its most extreme cases always limited to a narrow 
local extent no one simultaneous universal change 
has ever taken place on the surface of the globe 
but all effects however great have been aocom 
plished by a series of local and partial changes and 
even where we may be left to conjecture as to the 
violence or suddenness of those changes with reqpeet

to tinicf we have ocular proof of their extent in 
kice all that geology establishes then in this 
particular is the ct of the gradual origination of 
new species but by no means the particular method 
or process by which it has been brought about 

it itrue there have not been wanting theories to 
explain theseprocesses on natural principles yet 
of theses the most celebrated have failed to stand 
the test of increasing observation while none per 
haps have been altogether satisfactory or free from 
material objections physical research cannot bring 
us to any distinct idea of the nature of creation 
if we consider the simple case of the introduction 
of a single new species or even individual of a new 
species there is an obvious limit imposed on our 
speculations on the other hand it is freely open 
to the physical inquirer to trace as closely as pos 
sible the secondary nieansf as fsetr as the nature of the 
case admits to investigate rigorously for example 
all the modifications which change of climate domes 
tication crossing of breeds c may produce such 
inquiries may be far from successful they may lead 
only to some few imperfect conclusions utterly insuf 
ficient to ground any theory upon but certainly 
this is the only course open to the inductive inquirer

another of such modifications as we observe in 
intermediate races being perpetuated of new spe

various collateral topics which are intolved in these 
inquiries have all formed the sulgects of anxious 
debate and even of animated controversj among 
physiologists there has undoubtedly been a pre 
ponderance of evidence against the notion and the 
high authority of cuvier has been claimed as head 
ing the phalanx of the opponents whilst on the 
other hand geoffroj st hilaire has spoken of the 
 age of cuvier as approaching its termination 
and the immutability of species as a conviction fiut 
fading away from mens minds all that i presume 
to observe on such a subject is this that it is a 
question fairly open to philosophical discusdon 
and one which is at any rate the only avenue to a 
scientific solution of the problem if natural science 
be ever able to conduct us to the knowledge of such 
a point it must be by some such route as this 
and we have no more reason to despair of its doing 
so in this case than in any of the other instances of 
philosophical discovery which in a past age might 
have been pronounced as hopeless and visionaiy as 
some are now disposed to consider this while we 
must also recollect that all the conclusions which 
have been deduced from the observed facts relating 
to the modifications of species are restricted by the 
condition of the short period of time during which 
their operation has been contemplated and that we 
must admit as essentially influential the very diflferent 
circumstances which might affect similar operationt 
continued through unlimited periods of past duiatioiu

the appeal to another kind of evidence to know 
ledge derived from another source than that of phy 
sical inquiry conducted on the principles of esta 
blished natural analoes would merely transfer our 
inquiry out of the pale of physical science into that 
of moral authority and would consequently divest 
it of all force in respect to the purpose of substan 
tiating the great truths of natural theology the 
proper conclusions of physical inquiry are to be 
directed only to the two simple points the actual 
occurrence of successive originations of species and 
the elucidation as far as possible of the secondaiy 
means by which those originations may have been 
brought about 

geology then affords abundant proof of the fitct 
that there was a time when the present races of 
oiganized beings did not exist and consequently 
bears direct testimony to the occurrence of what we 
term creation that is the introduction of new spe 
cies as it does also of the previous introduction of a 
vast series of other species of which it also shows 
the successive extinction but the evidence is per 
fectly clear as to the gradual character of this intro 
duction of species those now existing are found 
to have coexisted with others now extinct as these 
did in their turn with those of older date untu we 
arrive at periods when whole genera and classes were 
entirely different but at no period do we find an 
absence of oiganized life followed by a simultaneous 
universal production of it

when therefore on geolocal grounds re speak 
of the evidence of creation we must carefully bear 
in mind what is meant and must restrict our mean 
ing to the gradual appearance of one increasing 
family while another was as gradually wasting away 
and disappearing geology in a word bears witness 
to a continued perhaps perpetual successions of 
creations it consequently tends infinitely to exalt 
our ideas of that eternal and overruling omnipotence 
by whose agency they were brought about 

but no researches have disclosed the mode in 
which this has taken place nor the process by which 
such a result of creative omnipotence has been 
accomplished it only assures us that it was not 
applied to all existing species at any one time 
while therefore geology has been unable to trace 
the mode of the divine operations it has beyond all 
question substantiated the fact of such creative 
processes and the leading truth of this gradual 
progress of the development of the varieties of 
organized life corresponding with changes in the 
disposition of the solid materials of the earths sur 
face and of the temperature and climate is perhaps 
among the most striking and beautiful points of 
evidence which geology affords to the conclusions of 
natural theology

this unbroken continuance of uniform laws and har 
monious adaptation to vhich geology bears testimony 
existing throughout all the vast series of the successive 
orders of organized beings which have tenanted the 
glolje which while it exhibits the greatest diversity 
in the forms of life and structure whicu have pre 
viuled at different remote epochs yet shows every 
where the preservation of the same most perfect 
harmony and analogy through periods of incalculable 
duration and it is to be particularly observed how 
essential to this argument is the fact before dwelt 
upon that all this was absolutely ininlenupted by 
any period of anarchy by the occurrence of any 
general ruin or disorganization by the intervention 
of any epoch at which the traces of organization 
were obliterated or defaced or disturbed or at which 
at least a large part of the earths surface was not 
teeming with animation and richly furnished with 
all the accessories of life and enjojrment 

remarks similar to those just made on the idea of 
crealioih will in fact apply nth considerable force to 
the entire argument of natural theology natural 
science can exhibit to us nothing but a series of 
physical causation from this we infer design that is 
moral causation but no such deduction can ever 
guide us to the discovery of the mode of operation 
or enable us to trace the method by which the 
supreme volition executed its designs or to supply 
the connecting link between physical and moiml 
causation

fived laws the proofs of design 



the last remark leads us naturally to a more extended 
view of the evidence derived from the actual preva 
lence so far as we can trace it of one fixed system 
of physical laws 

we have already observed the importance of the 
testimony which all science gives to the invariable 
order and constant uniformity of the laws of the 
material world from what we know observe and 
calculate we are led to the inference of the perpe 
tual and universal maintainance of this principle 
and it is upon the security of it that analogy becomea 
a safe guide in cases beyond the limits of actual 
experience 

this grand conclusion forms the solid basis on 
which we rest our convictions of the immutability of 
the divine attributes and counsels and this is 
perhaps of all others the reflection which to a think 
ing and philosophic inquirer tends most to exalt 
his ideas of the divine erfections — the regulation 
of all the varied and complicated actions of the 
material world by an unvarying system the combi 
nation of a limited number of first principles pro 
ducing all the variety and harmony of the creation 
the sufficiency of a few simple laws to regulate the 
entire complexity of the vast mechanism the first 
constitution of the world upon a principle whicht 



¦ ¦ ¦ — ¦¦ ¦ • tvviurr v ii iiii 



 relation of physical saencb 

ivithout further interposition contains within itself 
the means of perpetual renovation and stability 

now this conclusion rests as we have said on 
the collective inferences of a real maintainance of 
inviolable order in the material world it is evident 
then that any event occurring to interrupt the pre 
servation of this order would be a serious exception 
and formidable difficulty in the way of our conclusion 

the only escape from it would be in supposing 
that the violation of order was only apparent and not 
real that though seeming an exception it was in 
truth not contrary to the rule — though the rule in 
all its extent was unknown to us that the circum 
stance apimrently anomalous was still in accordance 
avith some recondite system unperceived by us that 
our view of the real law was not yet sufficiently 
extensive or complete our only course would then 
be to retrace our steps and attempt the inquiry 
again on better grounds 

for once imagine that real design and a deter 
minate law are not somewhere preserved and we are 
involved in the anarchy of chaos and the darkness of 
atheism or suppose that it is not traceable by us 
and so far to us the prooft are defective or admit 
the notion of the enthusiast that all physical con 
clusions of this sort are the mere offspring of proud 
and overweening human reason and we are idolaters 
worshipping a deity who is the creature of our own 
imaginatioii 

it may be desirable therefore to recur for a

moment to the consideration of inductive laws in 

general 

of the extent to which that regularity may be 
consistent anth occasional apparent anomaly it is 
perhaps impossible to convey an adequate idea with 
out referring to those astonishing instances which are 
afforded by mathematical formulas but some illua 
trations of this kind are put in a very luminous and 
popular form by mr babbage in a work already 
referred to it is for example possible in his cal 
culating machine to make such an austment that 
a series of numbers shall be produced in succession 
which are all complete squares at a certain pointy 
one number shall occur which is a cube after this 
the square numbers shall be resumed and condnue 
without limit tliis exception might bo deemed an 
anomaly an interruption of the law imposed but it 
is really a part and consequence of it indeed the 
analytical mathematician can produce many instances 
of formulas which give rise to a series of quantities 
apparently following a certain regular order but at 
particular points interrupted as it were yet again 
resumed and continued which are called discon 
tinuous functions the original principle is in 
these cases more comprehensive than we should be 
led to suppose from a limited contemplation of its 
results

such illustrations iu guiding his tiews of the order 
of the natural avorld events apparently anomaou 
and seeming like absolute interruptions of uniformitjt 
may be only so because we have not attained a suf 
ficiently extended view of the entire system to which 
they really are united as essential and harmonious 
parts 

and such considerations become of more special 
importance in reference to those sublime conclusions 
of natural theology to which we have just before 
referred those who admit them in general may not 
be prepared to perceive the full extent to which they 
hold good yet the consideration of apparent excep 
tions and seeming contradictions and suggestions by 
which to resolve the difficulties are surely most 
important for vindicating our belief in an eternal 
providence

let us take as an example the system of universal

of unvarying laws throughout the solar system as the 
necessary results of one grand principle in fitct estsr

imaned imineliate arbitrary intervention in eveij 
motion of the planetary bodies and in any depart 
ment of plitsical inquiry the same remark would 
apply in the one case we might imagine such 
agency but we could have no rational proof of it 
in the other alone do we arrive at the sole means of 
proof of which our limited powers are capable 

such has ever been the progress of physical science 
in all its departments from confusion to order finom 
arbitrary influence to systematic arrangement finom 
capricious agency to overruling intelligence 

these remarks will prepare the reader to take in 
its correct sense an observation of laplace which 
has been much dwelt upon and as i think unhap 
pily misunderstood owing in no small degree to 
that ambiguity which ve before noticed in the use of 
the words final cause and which in the sentence 
about to be quoted are obviously employed as equi 
valent to the words direct intervention 

• let us says laplace run over the histoij of 
the progress of the human mind and its errors we 
shall erietually see final causes pushed away to 
the bounds of its knowledge these causes which 
newton removed to the limits of the solar systemt 
were not long ago conceived to obtiun in the atmo 
sphere and employed in explaining meteors they 
are therefore in the eyes of the philosopher nothing 
more than the expression of the ignorance in which 
we are of the real causes 

after what has been said it will be superfluout to

oser further comment on this passage the tendency 
of which when rightly understood is manifestly so 
far from hostile to the true doctrine of final causes 
that it points directly to those profoundly adjusted 
arrangements which constitute the toiy soundest 
proofs of divino intelligence pervading the system 
of the universe 

peiiibahans — stability of the system 

newton developed in the most complete and satis 
factory manner all the grander features of the system 
of universal gravitation to that great principle 
simple indeed in its law but wholly mysterious in 
its nature and mode of operation he successfully 
referred all the more palpable and conspicuous 
motions of the heavenly bodies here was in truth 
a physical cause of the most universal efficiency but 
one which he was peculiarly careful to insist on in 
the sole sense of an universal act or law — the 
tendency of all matter to fall together with a force 
proportional directly to the mass and inversely to 
the square of the distance to this physical cause 
then he was able to trace all the greater pheno 
mena of the solar system 

but it was confessedly the fitct that there existed 
some slight irregularities in the motions of the 
planets and it was even a consequence of gravi 
tation that they must act one on another in a very 
complicated manner in consequence of their peipe 



to natural thbologt 



 



tually varying relative positions and thus disturb the 
perfect regularity of each others motion the inves 
tigation of those perturbations was not followed up 
by newton he was aware of their existence and 
that they were but small in amount and always 
allowed for them in speaking of the exactness with 
which the law of elliptic orbits prevails he con 
ceived however that these inconsiderable irregu 
larities which may have arisen from the mutual 
actions of comets and planets upon one another will 
be apt to increase till this system wants a reformar 
tionv 

this remark occurs in a jmssage where he is 
expressly speaking of the order and harmony of the 
system as an indication of design he had also 
before said that the main business of natural phi 
losophy is to deduce causes from effects till we come 
to the very first cause which certainly is not mecha 
nicalf and again that from observing the order 
of the visible world and so inferring creative intel 
ligence it is unphilosophical to seek for any other 
origin of the world or to pretend that it might arise 
out of a chaos by the mere laws of nature though 
being once formed it may continue by those lais for 
many ages 

the observation first quoted has in conjunction 
with these last been viewed as expressing newtons 
belief that the adjustments of the planetary system

looked upon by many as one of the most valuable 
inferences from tho newtonian system from a 
reference to the passage it will be seen at once that 
newton does not himself expressly make the infer 
ence nor when carefully considered is it one of any 
peculiar importance or force it is difiicult to see in

of design afforded in such overwhelming abundance 
by the existing order of the system

which they must peqetually recur this has been

but though we find the principle of gravitation thus 
perfect within itself and containing a perpetual 
source of reparation for all disturbances yet here we 
must not restrict our speculations to the action of 
gravitation alone no part of the universe no phy 
sical principle must be contemplated in an isolated 
point of view the consequences of gravitation 
must not be regarded alone without also considering 
other causes by which they may be modified and 
the disclosure of the high probability that the pla 
netary spaces are filled by a medium inconceivably 
rare yet capable in an immense lapse of time of 
sensibly resisting the motions of the planets opens 
to our view an extraneous cause which will modify 
the effects resulting from the action of gravitation 
alone the perturbations may be perpetually com 
pensated but the orbits of all the bodies of the 
system will by the resistance of the nthereal

medium take a gradually more and more compressed 
form as the range of a projectile is narrowed by 
the resistance of the air they will moto with 
increased telocity continually approach the snn in 
nearer gyrations and at length fall into his mass 

the lapse of time which will be necessary to 
accomplish this is indeed so incouceitably immense 
that we might well call the stability of the system 
perpetual the probability of such resistance has 
only been evinced by certain extremely minute 
effects produced on the orbit of that angular and 
scarcely material substance the periodical comet of 
enck a sort of unsubstantial thing a mere wisp of 
vapour which yet obeys the laws of impulse and 
gravity and revolves about the sun the aether

it has indeed been contended by some able and 
philosophical writers that there are few condusioiif 
of science which so strongly force upon the mind 
the conviction of a supreme power as those whidi 
refer to the finite nature of all created things 
which make the period when the present order of

mliicli are most hidden from our knowledge for tbe 
indications of the divinity to contend that irhen 
natural causes il us ive are in an especial manner 
driven to admit direct divine intervention and that 
irhen meclmnical laws apparently cease to apply 
then we must more peculiarly recognize the domi 
nion of the deity the view which i have been 
here endeavouring to illustrate is precisely the 
reverse the evidences of the divine operation 
seem to me manifested precisely in proportion as we 
can trace material laws and physical laws 

a world enveloped in entire obscurity as to phy 
sical causes would to my apprehension be a world 
without the evidence of a deity an universe 
without appreciable laws would be a chaos not a 
creation and by parity of reason in those regions 
of nature where we are most involved in ignorance 
there is the deity most hidden from our perceptions 
and instead of groping in the darker recesses where 
induction has not yet penetrated to find him we 
shall more rationally go forth to behold him in 
those brighter regions which are illumined by dis 
covered causes and demonstrated lav 

yet so powerful has been the prudice to the 
contrary that not only have the unexplained obsco 
rities of nature been religiously venerated as the 
penetralia of natural worshij but it has been held 
dangerous to indulge in the most philosophical coff 
jectures and impious to speculate on causes whicb 
may be most rationally imagined to prevail when we

we may illustrate this remark by the instance of 
the essential principle of gravity which in the pre 
sent state of our knowledge is wholly enveloped in 
mystery but do we thence gain any thing in 
favour of final causes or the belief in divine agency 
on the contrary if future discoveries should disdoee 
to us the nature of this universally mysterious agent 
and bring it under the dominion of mechanical laws 
we shall obtain so much the higher insight into the 
recondite mechanism of the world and the more 
striking proofs of the skill of its divine artificer 

such were the sentiments of the most enlightened 
of newtons followers even in his own times and 
when in the controversy to which his discoveries 
were at first exposed the absurd accusation was 
urged by bis continental opponents that by pushing 
the physical explanations of phenomena beyond due 
bounds the philosopher unwarrantably intruded into 
the region of primary causation according to the 
confused idea so commonly prevalent of their rela 
tive nature the reply of dr s clarke than whom 
no one was better able to see the theological bear 
ing of the case was simply si m leibnits ou

aggregation of matter 

to take another example of those phenomena of 
the universe which have not been reduced to mecha 
nical causes we may cite that which is dwelt upon 
by newton in the following passage if the matter 
of the sun and planets was evenly disposed through 
out an infinite space it would never convene into 
one mass but some of it would convene into 
one mass and some into another so as to make an 
infinite number ofmasscs scattered at great distances 
from one to another throughout all the infinite 
space and thus might the sun and theficd stars be 
formed supposing the matter were of a lucid nature 
but how the matter should divide itself into two 
sorts and that part of it which is fit to compose a 
shining body should fall down into one mass and 
make a sun and the rest which is fit to compose 
an opaque body should coalesce not into one great 
body like the shining matter but into many little 
ones or if the sun were at first an opaque body 
like the planets or the planets lucid bodies like the 
sun how he alone should be changed into a shining 
body whilst all they continue opaque or all they 
be changed into opaque ones whilst he remains

unchanged do not thinkeplicaile hj mere natural 
causes but nm forced to ascribe it to the counsel and 
contricance of a voluntary ayent 

such was the cotyecture of newton in accordance 
with the existing state of philosophical views he 
considered the phenomena not explicable by mere 
natural causes and therefore had recourse to a 
supernatural cause but supposing the case allowed 
to be thus unexplained by any knoavn natural causes 
we have still to observe that it would oftord no more 
evidences of supernatural agency than simply that 
which is furnished by the observed yhcfo of the adap 
tation of the masses and respective physical con 
ditions of the sun and of the planets to each other 
and this evidence is unaltered whether the observed 
fact can be accounted for or not and if it could 
be accounted for on any known physical principle 
 so far from detracting from the manifestation of 
design this would only the more augment our 
impression of delyiervading skill and recondite 
adjustment throughout the planetary world but 
though we should admit that no cause has been 
assigned it would be manifestly contrary to eveiy 
principle of the inductive philosophy to affim that 
none can or will be 

avhen therefore we find laplace suggesting what 
is after all professedly but a conjecture as to the 
lrobable course merely which inquiiy might pro

perlj take on such a question it ought neither to 
be regarded as it has been as an imrarrantable 
extension of philosophical analogy nor dreaded as 
in some instances as in the least degree hostile to 
the argument for design so r from this if verified 
it would but enhance the value of that argument 
he in feet simply suggests amid these uncertain 
ties the wisest course would be to devote ourselves 
to determining by repeated experiments the laws 
of affinity in order to arrive at what would appear 
the simplest means of comparing these forces with 
that of gravitation 

if any law of affinity should ever be developed to 
such an extent as in any degree to meet the object 
here in view and we can never say that discovery 
may not be carried so r the only result surely 
would be the most overpowering conviction of the 
extension of the same vast unity of design through 
out the mechanism of the material system 

the nebtdar hypothesis 

closely connected with this last case is the nebu

more peculiar degree called forth the censures and 
obloquy of those who were intent on allowing no 
secondary means as the instruments or channels of

which our planetary system is included and of which 
our sun is merely one of the innumerable stars which

in various parts of the heavens the telescope dis 
closes to us patches of diffused luminous matter 
called nebulae bearing a general resemblance in 
appearance to the milky way as seen by the naked

telescopes to condst of numerous stars mostlj 
appearing in the midst of a mass of diffused light 
in some cases the starry points are brilliant and 
defined in others more diffused or merely points 
of greater luminous intensity than the surrounding 
region calculation assures us of the inconcdvable 
distance from us beyond which they are situatedt 
and measurement by consequence teaches us their 
enormous magnitude so vast that in many of them 
not only the solar system but the whole mass of the 
milky way to which it belongs would be lost hint 
we find as far as observation can be carried into the 
vastness of the universe besides distinct stars an 
infinity of other systems of stellar matter in the 
form of these nebulk dispersed through spacer 
and of which our entire system included in the 
 nebula to which it belongs forms but one of the

philosophical conjecture has been applied to these 
facts and upon veiy reasonable analogjj astrono 
mers have indulged in the contemplation of these 
different forms in which sidereal matter is presented 
to us as exhibiting so many different stages in the 
progress of the formation of sidereal systems 

in the first instance such matter seems to assume 
the form of a faint diffused nebulosity in the next 
some of these masses appear as if in obedience to 
attractive forces they had assumed a spherical figure

nucleus surrounded by the more diffuse and yet 
uncondensed portion others again to use the words 
of an eminent writer in which the apparently 
unformed and irregular mass of nebulous light is just 
curdling as it were into separate systems and 
further there are some in a more complete con 
dition presenting a congeries of distinct points of 
light each perhaps the sun of a system more vast 
and glorious than our own but invidble to us 
whilst in the case of the actual systems of double 
and triple stars whose motions have been actually 
observed and calculated we find the exact counter 
parts of our own planctaiy world which have arrived 
at a corresponding point in the history of their eon

analogical conjecture then has been broached 
under the name of the nebular hypothesis to illus 
trate the process of the formation of our own system 
by what we behold iu its different and probably suo 
cessive stages in other cases it has been imagined 
that our system has been gradually evolved and con 
densed out of the nebula to which it belongs and 
each of its planetary masses gradually consolidated 
from a previous state of expanded nebulosity and 
this idea is further strengthed from the consideration 
of the probable high temperature from which our 
globe is believed to have cooled down to its present 
condition and consequently to have undeigone pro 
gressive condensation while we have again the 
analogy of comets nebulous masses of extremely 
attenuated matter yet existing as parts of our sys 
tem and still further what recent observation has 
rendered very probable vast quantities of unconso

conduct our sublimest speculations solely by an

and which has been reiterated bjr some modem 
writers 

what he objects to is the violation of all correct 
order of reasoning by assumify the theological view 
of final causes in physical inquiries where it should 
be the very thing to be deduced andprwed 

the fault to be guarded against is that of taking 
any metaphysical notions of final causes any refer 
ence to moral causation as the basis and guide of 
physical theories in proportion as we do this we 
vitiate the conclusions of natural theology by an 
argument in a circle we assume the point to be 
proved this was precisely the error of descartes 
and his school from assumed metaphysical ideas 
of the deity and his attributes they affected to reason 
downwards to the deduction of the laws and pheno 
mena of nature it is manifest says descartes 
 that me shall follow the best way of philosophiidng 
i from the knowledge of god himself we endeavour 
to deduce the knowledge of the things created by 
him — that thus we may attain the most perfect kind 
of science the knowledge of effects from thdr 
causes • he was accused of neglecting final 
causes the fact was in one sense the conside 
ration of them was in his system superfluous in 
another the whole theory consisted of nothing else 

this system was charged with having an atheistic

tendency in one sense this ras palpably nntrae 
as the iihole of it was built on the supposition of the 
divine attributes in another it might be open to 
the accusation if it be allowed that a system is inju 
rious to the cause of religion which destroys and 
confounds all rational evidence of its truth this 
remark may not be destitute of application even at 
the present day the system of descartes as such 
has now no adherents but there are reasoners of 
several schools who ml into precisely the mistake 
here exposed 

thus then it is that the study of physical causa 
understood in the simple meaning which we have 
before endeavoured to fix while it supplies the 
unassailable evidence of design and adjustment aa 
unavoidably carries us thence onward to the idea of 
an intelligence from which that design emanated 
and of an agency by which that adjustment was pro 
duced it brings us in a word to recognise an 
influence of another kind of an order different from 
and far above that of physical causes or material 
action — to acknowledge a sublime moral causcf the 
universally operating source of creative power and 
providential wisdom but we grasp these truths 
only in their proofs and manifestations of the 
mode of influence or operation we are wholly and 
necessarily ignoraxit even in ordinary cases of moral 
agents within the scope of our observation we fail

entirely in conceiving tbe mode in which mind can 
influence matter much more then must this be the 
case with regard to the unseen and infinite moral 
cause of tho system of the universe 

secondmy causes and ike first oauie 

by such considerations as those above adduced on 
sound and unexceptionable groundsi we establish the 
momentous and elevated truth of one great moral 
cause of all things and in this sense as referring 
to the idea of designing wisdom and infinite intelli 
gence we perceive the wide distinction between the 
use of the term cause and that adopted when we 
speak of secondary or physical causes 

we have already noticed in other cases the ambi 
guities arising from the diversity of meaning attached 
to the same term cause here then it becomes 
more peculiarly necessary if we adopt the popular 
expression • the first cause to recur carefully to 
the distinction if we would preserve any clearness 
of reasoning 

we refer to senses of the term absolutely distinct 
in kind nor is it a term of mere verbal difference 
it is of importance whether in guarding against fiil 
lacies in evidence or in answering the cavils of scep 
ticism 

now the result of our inquiiy into the nature of 
physical causes was such as to carry our ideas rather to 
the extension of order and nnifoimity than to the mo

cessiofi of efficient acts tbroagfaout the physical world 
rather to simultaneous relation than to consecutive 
result expressions involving the idea of priority 
in time seem then calculated to convey erroneous 
impressions at least in reference to the nature of 
phyrical laws or causes and when we ascend to 
the contemplation of creative intelligence the dis 
tinction is not between a prior and a subsequent 
train of material action but between physical order 
and moral volition 

it will thus be apparent that the metaphortso often 
used of the chain of natural causes whose last and 
highest link is its immediate connexion with the 
deity — the very phrase of a succession of secondary 
causes traced up to a jlrst cause — and the like so 
commonly employed are founded on a totally mis 
taken analogy they refer to a mere succession of 
mechanical impulses traced up to a first mechanical 
power to a series of physical changes referred suc 
cessively to some more and more general physical 
principle the adoption of such a mode of repre 
sentation when extended to the deity would seem 
to make the first cause but one of a continued series 
of physical causes and differing from them only in 
order of priority or generality it would confound 
the efficient intelligence with the mere material 
manifestation of it — the creator with the creation 

if we retain such metaphorical language at all it 
would be a more just mode of speaking to describe 
the deity as the divine artificer of the whole chain 




to natural thboloot 



 



— not to connect liim with its links — to represent 
the secondary causes as combined into joint operation 
by his power and will — but not to make him one 
of them 

but the common figures besides thdr manifest 
impropriety are singularly ill adapted to place before 
our view the most important part of hie trnth nay 
are even calculated to hide and disgmae it for by 
the fomiliar use of these phrases uie mind is habi 
tually diverted from the conrideiatiim that this 
 chain a portion of which we can handle and 
examine is to be so examined to teadi us the dciu 
of the artificer and instead of this we are led away 
to the irrelevant consideration of where the end of it 
may be fixed 

it then surely will be allowed no small import 
ance to preserve carefully the distinction between 
moral and physical causation it is by this distinc 
tion that we advance from mere phyrical relations to 
any inference of a higher order of things it is this 
mhich elevates our ideas from the mere material 
elements to the recondite intelligenee which per 
vades the harmonious arrangement of theul 

if we require the aid of metajor in attempting 
to give utterance to those vast ocmoeptions with 
which the mind is overpowered instead of speaking 
of the first and secondary links in a dbain of canssp 
tion and the like let us rather reenr to the analogj 
of the arch before introduced and we shall be

and shall here run no risk of speaking as if we con 
founded the stones with the builder — their mutually 
supporting force with the skill of the architect who 
acusted them 

tliese considerations may enable us then to per 
ceive the entire futility of those objections which are 
often urged against the study of secondary causes as 
being injurious to our due apprehension and acknow 
ledgment of the first cause — so fiur from it they in 
fact furnish the sole rational or natural means of 
leading us to that apprehension and acknowledg 
ment and in the language of newton understood 
agreeably to the distinctions before laid down 
 though every true stop made in this hilosophy 
brings us not immediatcbf to the knowledge of the 
first cause yet it brings us nearer to it and on that 
account is to be highly valued 

argument from design to luelligence 

we have thus far referred only in a very general 
sense to the notion we form of the great source of 
design and order in nature or in popular language 
the first cause or supreme intelligence in a more 
precise sense it may become a question how fiir is 
this language and this inference borne out by any 
conclusions of our unaided reasoning powers 
firom the regularity permanence and universality

of physical catisation wo conclado the existence of a 
moral causation from tuo manifestations of order 
and purposo we infer an ordaining and designing 
mind that these are tuuural inferences and ideas 
almost unavoidably occurring to u is perfectly true 
but tho very point of inquiry in natural theology is 
the growul of the inference and the analysis of the 
natural impression 

now it has been contended by some professed 
friends to religion that beyond the bare fact of order 
and fitness we can really infer nothing by the mere 
powers of reason and that the conclusion of an 
independent intelligent supreme existence if it be 
anything more than a mere truism is a vain pre 
sumption that in one sense it is mere tautology to 
say that design implies a designer or else in another 
sense idle to suppose that our finite reason can teach 
us anything of the purposes or nature of an infinite 
being 

now the bare ct of order and arrangement is 
on all hands undisputed though commonly most 
inadequately understood and appreciated 

the inference of design intention forethought 
is something beyond the last mentioned trutht and 
not to be confounded toith it this implies intelu 
gent agency or moral causation hence again we 
advance to the notion of distinct existence or whia 
is sometimes called personality and thence proceed

to ascribe the other divine attributes and perfections 
as centering in that independent being 

such probably would be the distribution of our 
thoughts as successively pursued if we proceeded to 
any systematic analysis of our reasonings on the 
subject it is not perhaps a species of examination 
to which many are inclined even of those who take 
delight in the general contemplation of the truths 
with which they are impressed by the examination 
of the natural world 

yet a careful consideration of the orderly series of 
simple elements into which we can analyze our con 
ceptions is of eminent use even though we do not 
practically and habitually go through such a process 
every time we think on the subject it enables us 
as well to assure ourselves of the validity of our own 
conceptions as to detect the mlacies of sceptical 
objections 

now here i conceive we shall have no need to 
enter upon any abstruse or difficult discussion i 
believe it will suffice to elucidate the subject if we 
simply look to the use of language in analyzing 
the train of inferences or ideas referred to the con 
deration of the origin and precise meaning of the 
term we employ appears to me most vitally essen 
tial and yet most commonly overlooked while 
from the neglect of it most of the misapprehensions 
which prevail on the subject take their rise

tary agents and intelligent beings witbin tbe scope 
of our observation we follow up an analogjf 
between these and the vast manifestations exhibited 
in the order of nature and from this andogy we 
attempt however inadequately to express our limited 
and imperfect conceptions of the infinite and incom 
prehensible moral cause of the universal order and 
system of natural causes 

tlie same remark applies to the further inference 
of the distinct cjcistcnce of the source of moral causar 
tion our whole notion of which seems to depend on 
our idea of the relation of moral causation to mind 
in the cases within our experience the metaphy 
sical notions which seem to be involved will i 
believe be found to resolve themselves into the same 
simple consideration of the use of terms applied by 
analogy from what we experience in ourselves and in 
beings about us this i conceive will on reflection 
be found the clue which will safely guide us through 
at least a large portion of the intricacies of the sub 
ject considerations of this kind however are vitally 
necessary to the argument of natural theology and 
this portion of the subject involving what has been 
termed the psychological argument is beyond 
question most essential to an exact and philosophical 
discussion though certainly not placed in a suffici 
ently prominent light if regarded at all by some of 
the most excellent and popular writers

the divine supremacy 

we may hero observe further that if we retain the 
popular ktnguage and speak of the jirst cause and se 
coiidafy causes wo must at all events bear in mind 
that the term first is relative we cannot extend 
our conclusions beyond our evidence it is entirely 
from our investigation of secondary or physical 
causes that we can recognise the sublime moral 
cause which ordered them all it is thus manifest 
that we can properly attach no other idea to the term 
 first cause than one which is simply relative to 
these secondary causes natural theology cannot 
lead us to any higher inference nor is it any 
reproach to this science that it does not enable us to 
proceed beyond the limits of its oavn province nor 
to answer the question sometimes propounded in 
this form of illustration the examination of a 
watch leads us to infer a watchmaker but it cannot 
answer the further question who made the watch 
maker yet this question has been made the 
subject of much misapjirehension and objectioiit 
miunly as appears to me from want of reflectionand 
caution in the use of words or perhaps after all 
rather from some feeling of offence taken at the

mere form and terms in which the iqostratioii has 
been propounded 

throngliout the utmost extent of our inyestiga 
tion of physical causes wo trace the proofs of that 
moral volition which is prior and superior to them 
all proofs exhibited alike throughout all the yast 
ncss and all the minuteness of the universe in 
creasing and augmenting in overwhelming multi 
plicity with no other limit than that imposed on the 
extent of our observations and inductions as far 
as science has reached and in whatever direction 
wo still discover this same moral cause transcendant 
in a supremacy coextensive with the creation sole 
in dominion to all the extent of known worlds and 
continually exhibited to us one and the same bj 
every new extension of knowledge every fresh 
incursion of science into hitherto unknown regions 
and this constitutes our inductive ground of belief 
in what we term the mpremacy of the same one 
moral cause and source of the entire order of phy 
sical causes the first relatively to them a divine 
power supreme to m and to all created beings 



the divine unity 

the unity of the great designing intelligenoe has 
been commonly inferred from the observed unity of 
the design but objections as to the insufficiency 
of the proof have been adduced such ogectioii 
however it appears to me can only be entertained 



kl 



j urcuil

from a want of that comprehensive stndj of physical 
philosophy which alone can convey any adequate 
conception of the vast and overwhelming evidences 
of that unity of plan and harmony of purpose which 
pervades the utmost limits of the known creation 

let it be observed tlmt the belief in the divine 
unity has advanced with the advance of sound induc 
tive science the ancient philosophers though they 
collected ocf were wanting in compidiensive indue 
tioh they reached to just conclndons within the 
narrow limits of certain isolated classes of ftcts 
but they had no principles of analogy to connect 
one class of ftcts with another they imagined 
nature in general to be given up to almost total 
anarchy and the universe an arena for the perpe 
tual combat of conflicting elements with this 
deficiency in their apprehension of the relations of 
physical causes it is hardly matter of surprise that 
they admitted a plurality of gods or an unlimited 
number of powers and agencies whether subordinate 
or independent 

but the introduction of a more just philosophy 
has entirely exploded all such vain imaginations 
the inductive method has applied the key to open 
to us a view of the sublime but simple order of 
natural causes and from that universal and un 
ceasing unity of plan in the laws of physical action 
has been derived our rational proof of the unity of 
the deity 

nevertheless it has been urged that unity of plan 



to natural theology 



 



might result from the cooeration of several minds 
powers or agencies but to suppose manj causes 
when one will suffice is clearlj unphilosophical 
and besides this the objection however plausible 
when stated merely in an abstract form will vanish 
the moment we reflect on the actual case of the 
material creation when we consider especially 
on the grounds adduced in the previous portion of 
these remarks the immense multiplicity of physical 
arrangements all so admirably harmonizing together 
the infinite combifuttion of adjustments each arranged 
in exact relation to the other as well as complete 
within itself we cannot but feel overwhelmed with 
the conviction that to one omniscient mind alone 
can be correctly attributed such infinite forethought 
and such boundless comprehensiveness of arrange 
ment 



objections to the study of secondary caue 

to the neglect of such simple distinctions as those 
wo have been engaged in illustrating and from mis 
conception mainly caused by ambiguity of terms 
as to the nature of physical causes and the relation 
in which they stand to the divine intelligence which

objections and prejudices which prevail with regard

we hear much alledged against the studj of phj 
sieal causes as having at best a tendency little con 
geiual to religious reflections and even hostile and 
injurious to its spirit by confining the attention it 
is commonly said to the investigation of secondary 
causes the thoughts are habitually nthdraivn from 
the first cause 

but such objections only furnish in fieut instances 
of the confusion of ideas from the ambiguous use of 
the term cause and they immediately disappear 
rhen we come to distinguish the meaning correctly 

even if the allegation were true that this dissocia 
tion of ideas is encouraged what does it amount to 
but an accusation that we mithdraw our thoughts 
from the conclusion in order to pursue the frooft 
avhat is it but the absurd charge that by giving our 
attention solely to the etxdeiioe we indispose our 
minds for the inference f

prejudices against the minute investigation of 
nature as an unworthy and trifling pursuit have not 
unfrcquently been entertained by those who were 
profoundly ignorant of the object and tendency of 
such pursuits and of the necessity of such precise 
inquiry for establishing the conclusions of all sound 
philosophy the cultivators of science have often 
been condemned to hear such aspersions cast upon 
their labours and to see the genuine spirit in

wbich they were answered vre may cite the testi 
mony of the illustrious father of british astronomyy 
rh upon a suspicion that his sublime pursuits were 
treated with ridicule in a letter to newton 
expresses his wonder that these occupations should 
be looked on as trifling other persons he says 
that come after me will think their time as little 
mispent in these studies as those did who have 
gone before me the works of the eternal provi 
dence i hope mill be a little better understood 
through your labours and mine than they were for 
merly think me not proud for this expresdon i 
look on pride as the worst of sins humility as the 
greatest virtue 

and the sentiment so nobly avowed by boyle 
when taxed with the childishness of his occupation 
in watcliing the coloura of soapbubbles deserves to 
be ever borne in mind as well by those who cultivate 
as those who cavil at physical inquiry nothing 
can be unworthy of being investigated by man 
which was thought worthy of being created by 

godf 

but science is often assailed with the charge of 
being wholly conversant with objects of sense and 
that confining us to the world of matter it restrains 
and disables the mind from the more worthy and 
elevating pursuit of moral and spiritual truth 

if however physical science be restricted to

objects of sense those very objects form the steps 
by which we ascend to the evidence of mind if 
natural philosophy be conversant solely with the 
aisible creation it is by the light of that which is 
visible tliat its true disciple penetrates beyond those 
limits into the presence of him who is invisible 

when therefore we hear the assertion so sacred 
in the eyes of many that experiment can never 
carry us beyond the region of matter that by 
physical induction we can never attain to truth in 
its legitimate and only valuable sense and that 
 all real philosophy radiates from the knowledge of 
god in such declamation it is diflscult to discover 
any thing but a hopeless confusion of thought most 
commonly assisted by a thorough ignorance of the 
nature of inductive science and a total misconcep 
tion of the very aim and character of philosophical 
inquiry 

or again they contend that natural theology is 
entirely founded upon vain curiosity and profitless 
speculations concerning the intentions of god 
and are loud in their condemnation of the arrogance 
which would lead a finite mind to attempt to com 
prehend the counsels of the infinite blind entirely 
to the hd that no such attempt is ever made no 
such object aimed at since in inferring desipi the 
inquirer is always foremost to confess his inability to 
trace its indications to the smallest extent beyond 
the limits which actual inductive evidence warrants

the pride of science 

nothino is more common tban to bear persons 
ignorant of physical science enlarging upon what 
they term the arrogance of the philosopher in 
drawing his conclusions and pretending to deter 
mine what is and what must be in regions utterly 
beyond the limits of sensible experience nothing 
more usual than to meet with those who talk not 
only with disbelief but with ridicule of the theories 
of the scientific pedant and in the most solemn 
tone declaim against the pride of reason and phi 
losophy as essentially hostile to the humility of 
faith they seem to regard the speculations of phy 
sical science as mere fancies in which the philo 
sopher indulges for the sole gratification of his own 
wayward presumption and in virtue of which he 
may assume a claim to the admiration of the tulgar 
little considering that these very speculations afford 
the only legitimate and substantial ground on whidi 
a reasoning inquirer can build his most sublime 
proofs of the existence and attributes of the divine 
being — that those very theories are nothing dse 
than the expression and the embodying of that ad 
pervading analogy and order in which the universal 
manifestations of the divine mind are disclosed 
tons 

so long as correct induction is our gnide we may 
with safety pursue phydcal speculation to any

extent the only real presumption is in tbe de 
liarture from sound inductive principles and the 
attempt to interpret nature without their aid in 
ductive research undoubtedlj claims the right of an 
absolutely unlimited extent of inference even when 
it points to objects too vast or too minute too 
remote in space or too deep in the abyss of time to 
come at all within the grasp of our £eumlties tbe 
sole consideration it regards is the accuracy and 
truth of its evidence if this be in the first instance 
firmly established the true philosopher will never 
shrink frxm admitting all its necessary consequeneei 
however inconceivable may be their nature and 
incalculable tbeir extent 

if there were any reasonableness in prescrilung 
such limits if there were any real ground of doubt 
as to the universal preservation of the analogies of

limitation would amount in its direct consequences 
to a limitation in those inferences on which we frame 
all our notions of the deity any such ground of 
doubt would as fiir as it went tend to discredit our 
proofr of the divine perfections 

if tbe deductions of science are unwanantaue 
intrusions of the vain imagination of the selfsuffl

thereby attach the same accusation to the deductiims 
of natural theology if they condemn the condo 
sions of physical reasoning as arrogant and impiooa 
intrusions of human selfconceit into mysteries 
beyond the reach of the human fiiculties so by 
necessary consequence they involve in the same 
condemnation the inferences mhich are dependent 
upon those researches the belief in the infinite per 
fection the unlimited immensity power and etemitj 
of the deity 

to some it is a peculiarly favourite topic that die 
powers of the human mind are but limited that 
there are mysteries in nature which must for ever 
baffle the most acute research and not content with 
the assertion that there are such boundaries imposed 
on all human speculation are prone to affirm that the 
boundary has been reached whenever they meet with 
an unexplained phenomenon they seem to dwdl 
with special satisfaction on the circumstance that 
here is an instance of some natural wonder in the 
comprehension of which the greatest philosopher is 
os much at a loss as the ignorant peasant sudi 
instances they often hold out as instructive and 
salutary checks to the pride of science and humill 
ating to the pretendons of intellectual superiori

which they affect these reflections but too deariy

but to those who rightly estimate at once the real 
powers of the human mind and the true character of 
the inductive metliod it will be manifest how irrar 
tional such sentiments must be so long as we 
follow diligently and with becoming caution the 
humble but sure path of induction we can never 
arrive at any bar to our inquiries except those which 
are imposed by the deficiency of focts and we know 
by the testimony of all past experience that the

perpetually new and extended manifestations of order

inteiposhion — permanent law 

the notion of physical cause and effect being redaced 
to a bare sequence has been strongly objected to 
as iijurious to the belief in the divine agency in 
nature and the supposition of an acting efficient 
cause in every natural phenomenon has been empha 
tically insisted on as necessary for the support of 
that doctrine but from the view we have here 
taken of the nature of physical causes and thdri 
relation to moral we see that so far from snpportj 
ing the supposition of such direct perpetual inter 
vention would in fact invalidate the evidence of 
a first cause 

according to the view here supported of the nature 
of physical causes it has sufficiently appeared that 
in including in our idea the relation of the more par 
ticular to the more general fact we have assigned 
the origin of our ideas of the closest and most inse 
parable union of cause and effect and this relation 
is obviously dependent upon the degree in which we 
can generalize among the phenomena of nature 
that is upon the degree in which we can trace order 
and arrangement thus the greater the extent to 
which we can trace physical causes in this senses 
the more surely founded is the inference of moral 
on and allpowerful intelligence derived from 
the contemplation of this order of causes 

and avhen we reflect upon the unbounded vastnest 



 



relation of puysical science 



of nature which expands under our examination and 
which receives enlargement continually from every 
additional advance which the practical application of 
science confers on the perfection of our senses — 
when we find the same beauty and uniformity pre 
served throughout the utmost range of our obser 
vations — and when we add that all this is but a 
small speck in the actual immensity of the universe 
— we surely derive the highest posdble proofs and 
indications of recondite and perfect adjustment 
through the extent of the visible world so that 
we can but by feeble and dim analogies most imper 
fectly express our partial apprehension of a presiding 
and allpervading divine intelligence again if we 
turn from the consideration of space to that of time 
it is only by deciphering the monuments of the 
immense periods of successive organization up to 
the epoch of the first existence of animal life that 
we leam the testimony of nature to the fact of 
creation or rather succession of creations and in 
conformity with our limited conceptions speak of 
the infinite wisdom and skill of the divine intelli 
gence the infinite power of the creating deity 

unless we consent to reason from the analogy of 
known causes to those which are unknown — from 
the present to the remotest epochs of the past we 
must lose the whole argument from the continuance 
of order and arrangement we must be deprived of 
our sublimest conclusions which result from the per 
manence of the indications of design and harmontooi 



to natural thboloqt 



 



adaptation if we could trace material action no 
further than to resolve every effect into the result 
of an immediate arbitrary intervention the real 
evidences of divine intelligence would be wanting 

we thus perceive the futility of such chaiges as 
that by establishing the uniformity of second causes 
we impair the evidence of the divine interposition 
that by extending our researches into nature we 
encroach on the dominion of the sovereign of 
nature and that by enlaing the range of physical 
agency we detract from the majesty of the divine 
power whereas it is by these very researches that 
we establish and acknowledge his sovereignty and 
find in that very agency nothing else than his dele 
gated authority 

as reasonably should we construe the tranquillity 
of a wellordered community into a proof of the 
defective energy of the sovereign power because the 
daily immediate manifestation and interposition of 
that power was not necessary to cany on the govern 
ment as well might we consider it to detract from 
the perfection of a piece of machinery that it did not 
require the perpetual interposition of the artificer to 
keep it in action

the results of physical inquiry ith one consent all 
point to the existence of recondite principles of 
arrangement throughout nature of vast and uni 
versal design every separate instance of adjust 
ment does this by the evidences it contains within 
itself but the wonderful combination and multi 
plication of such evidence can only be appreciated 
from the extended comparison of general laws and 
the analogies by which those laws are related this 
supplies the most powerfully accumulating proof of 
ordaining intelligence and almighty mind 

the inconceivable minuteness on the one hand 
and the immense extent on the other to which we 
find these analogies still accurately preserved are 
perhaps of all other considerations the most effica 
cious in impressing us with the notion of the divine 
perfections the unbroken continuation of the same 
order and analogy whether throughout time or 
space joined with the consideration that all this is 
but finite is the reflection which above every other 
must inspire us with the most truly exalted notions 
of the divine immensity and eternity 

from such considerations we may perhaps better 
appreciate the real office of inductive philosophy 
and the nature of the service it discharges as minis 
tering to the sublime truths of natural theology 
the existence of some universal principles of ana 
logy and uniformity is the gromid of all inductive 
science the tradng out of such analogies through 
all their actual physical indications is that whidi 



to natubal theoloot 



 



furnishes tho great aigmnedt of natoral theologj 
and we acknowledge that this preservation of uni 
fomiitj and analogy which we have seen supplies 
the natural preliminary conjecture in all induction 
is in foct tlic very indication of the universal pre 
sence and allpervading energy of the one divine 
mind thus then these momentous and sublime 
conclusions rest upon a common basis with those of 
inductive science and thus invest science with the 
high sanction of their own sacred character esta 
blished by physical research they react upon it 
they supply the most elevated motive for the prose 
cution of the study of nature and the glorious 
truths which manifest themselves as we proceed 
cast back a lustre on the imth by which we have 
advanced and encourage the endeavour to approach 
their eternal source 

so fseir from any advantage arising to the stability 
of natural religion or any augmentation of force to 
the impressions of natural piety when nature remains 
veiled in mystery and we are compelled to own our 
ignorance of the modes and laws of her operations 
it is in fact the very unveiling of those mysteries 
the dispersion of that mist of ignorance the dis 
closure of the secrets of phydcal causation whidi 
supply the very proof and defence of the truths of 
natural theology the acknowledgment of supreme 
power and wisdom instead of being banished from

and it is in the very advance from what has been

we in proportion approach towards the worthy con 
ception of the great source of order the eternal

nature is but the rational evidence of god but 
even intellect and science are his gifts and the 
human mind his workmanship when therefore we

divinity in avhom all those perfections centre and 
from whom the entire order of nature emanates 
we have seen that a primary persuasion of unifor 
mity m nature is the guide to all our inductive 
investigations and is universally confirmed by the 
appeal to experimental evidence from which we 
ascend to laws and principles of successively higher 
generality and comprehensiveness from such suc 
cessive generalizations we arrive at the idea of 
secondary or properly physical causes and from 
the contemplation of their uninterrupted order arises 
our conviction of universal design and intelligence 
in the adjustment of the natural creation whence 
again our belief in the existence and perfections of 
the creator or first cause the great source of that 
moral causation in which all physical causation 
originates we have noticed the importance of 
keeping the order of this train of reasoning steadily 
in view that is if we would have our belief regu 
lated by any rational principles we have seen that 
it is absolutely essential to commence with purely 
phpical investigation by the sole method of induc 
tion and that any departure from this method any 
reference to other grounds of belief any attachment 
to preconceived notions any appeal to the dictation 
of authority are totally inadmissible if we would 
preserve unbroken the course of rational evidence 
and deduction in this most important argument

ceive that in discarding the proofs of reason thej 
are cutting away the pillars of the temple of faith 
in censuring physical philosophy they are vainlj 
assaulting the bulwarks of natural religion and are 
attacking their own allies in the dark when on 
religious grounds they disparage and condemn the 
study of physical truth they do not see that in 
proportion as their arguments might be valid would 
the proofs of their own religious principles be assailed 
in rejecting the evidence of inductive science thej 
are rejecting that of natural theology and whoe 
they so vehemently declaim on the weakness and 
insufficiency of the powers of the human mind for 
investigating religious truth they do not considert 
that it is precisely on this ground that we would 
restrain its speculations to the plain and humble 
method of inductive research into the fiicts and laws 
of the natural world and the sublime but insufficient 
deductions from them which lie properly within its 
province thence to b prepared to advance towards 
those higher attainments of religious illumination 
which supply all the deficiencies of mere natural

relation of natural theology 



in pursuing the subject of tho connexion between 
the truths of natural theology and those of revelation 
and of the independence on the one hand of physical 
science as the basis of the evidence and on the other 
the mutual relations of these several great branches 
of the inquiry i will commence with a few remarks 
on those primary doctrines which exercise so import 
ant an influence on the views taken of the authority 
and tenour of revelation and on the extent to which 
natural reason alone can guide us in those inquiries 
on the limit at which its own light fails us yet the 
degree of illumination which we must possess in 
order to find our way even to the point where we 
are to gain access to fuller disclosures 

our ideoji of the divine auributee 

soifb difference of opinion has prevailed as to the 
mode by which we arrive at our conclusions respect 
ing the divine attributes it has been maintained 
on one side that those conclusions are of the most 
limited nature it has been contended and with 
much appearance of reason that our inferences can 
only go to the extent of our evidence that the 
ideas of the divine attributes which we acquire in 
natural theology can only be legitimately framed 
and recognised in the degree and character in whidi 
the figicts of nature present the manifestations of 
them that we can infer the divine eternity and 
immensity only from those ideas of duration and 
extendon which the conclusions of geology and 



and physical saence to brvelation 



astronomy suggest that ro obtain oar notion of 
the divine omnipotence only from those nniform 
laws and unchanging processes in which it is deve 
loped that we arrive at our conception of the 
divine beneficence only from the contemplation of 
good mixed with evu that as far as natoral 
theology is concerned no adequate ideas of those 
attributes can be acquired or are even adapted to 
our aprehensions but those which the contem 
plation of physical analogies suggests in all these 
particulars the conclusions of natural theology mpl j 
are extremely imperfect and insnflscient but we 
have no other ground on wliich to frame our appre 
hension of a deity in the first instance the 
deficiency can be supplied only by the subsequent 
reception of the doctrines of revelation 

to this reasoning it has been objected that it 
would leave us with inferences of such attributes as 
not only fall short of any worthy notion of the deity 
but are even at variance with all idea of moral 

perfection as for instance in the case of icnicenoe 
mere reasoning on natural phenomena would only 
pyq us an idea of the production of good mixed 
with a considerable share of evil it has there 
fore been contended that we do not in fact form 
our conclusions without assuming the perfect and 
universal beneficence of the deity as antecedently 
probable and thus guided by this idea conclude 
from the manifestations of nature which partial 
confirm it the universality and infinity of the divine

benevolence regarding the partial instances of evil 
as in fact only apparent and not real exceptions— 
as merely seeming to be such from the imperfection 
of our apprehensions and this assumption has 
been traced to the inherent moral sense of human 
nature hich naturally perceives the perfection of 
moral good and thus cannot but suppose it in an 
infinite degree in the deity 

i vill merely remark — st when wc abstract 
from this moral sense it seems on all hands admitted 
that bare reasonhy on the facts of the natural world 
can conduct us no farther than to the inference of 
good mixed with evil or to the idea of a mixed 
attribute of beneficence not absolutely infinite 

dly bare reasoning without the moral conside 
ration might nevertheless lead us to allow that the 
evil was only apparent in consequence of our limited 
apprehensions thus without referring to the moral 
sense mere natural theology might leave xis with an 
idea eatremdy defective no doubt but still not con 
tradictary to any more worthy views of the divine 
nature afterwards to bo inculcated but on the 
contrary from the manifest deficiency we should be 
rather anxiously predisposed to receive such better 
intimation 

dly the question as to the operation and origin 
of this moral sense is one which is itself properly

open to investigation as a branch of metaphyrics of 
great imihrtance to natural theology and moml 
philosophy — the question whether such a sense is 
really inheirnt in human nature or acquired f oi 
if universal and natural whether it may not be 
analjtzed into simpler elements f or again admit 
ting that man is prone to entertain such ideas 
whether this be grounded in reason — are all points 
claiming most serious exmiiuition 

my object in these remarks is merely to direct 
attention to such important topics of inquiry without 
pretending to enter into the full discussion of them 
much less to propose a solution of the difficulties 
the preceding obcration refers particularly to the 
single instance of the attribute of beneficence but 
similar remarks must apply to the natural evidence 
of the other divine perfections 

the attribute of omnipotence for example is 
evinced by our reasoning upon the inconceivably vast 
indications of power displayed in the visible creatiod 
we discover everywhere the marks of sudi powef 
exerted to a degree beyond all possibility of oon 
ception in its intensity and magnitude yet we 
observe it only exercised in particular ways we 
infer directly its infinity in degree but we cannot 
strictly conclude its extension to all kinds of opera 
tion we recognise its effects in constituting and 
originating in austing and upholding the order rf 
physical causes we perceive its operation in rega 
lating the existing state of the universe and in the

gradual evolution of the existing frame of the world 
out of previous orders of existence we trace its 
mighty manifestations stamped with the same 
unchanging attributes of immensity through count 
less ages of duration and through the boundless 
expanse of space but it cannot be said that mere 
reason can therefore infer any other kifid of exercise 
of this power 

let it be distinctly borne in mind that the object 
of these remarks is solely that of caution as to the 
proper limits of the mere reasoning upon physical 
order which is the strict province of the science of 
natural theology 

there is however another point of view in which 
this subject is often regarded to which i must allude 
though as not strictly belonging to our present sub 
ject it can be but cursorily noticed however impor 
tant in itself the deity is proposed as the object 
not merely of our belief but of our practical adora 
tion and love in the imitation limited and imperfect 
as it must be of his moral perfections hence the 
vital practical importance of the most unimpeachable 
conception of those attributes and of removing every 
thing like a limitation on their infinite moral excel 
lence with the object of maintaining this practical 
view many excellent writers have gone into a variety 
of speculations directly imposing limits on our ideas 
of some of the divine perfections lest they should 
be at variance with the infinite excellence of others 
thus it has been distinctly argued in order to vindi 



akd physical science to revelallok 



cate the divine benevolence that we must sappose 
the deity tmalle to prevent evil or in other woidfl 
deny his omnipotence 

of such reasonings i will here say no more than 
this they are maintained and highly approved as 
propounded by the very able writer just referred to 
by parties of the most unquestionable piety and 
religious zeal those therefore who allow and 
admire these views can have no right to object to 
other siecuiations which in like manner tend to 
limit our conclusions as to the same attributes 
 the truth is the only rational conclusion which we 
can arrive at in the matter is that in the nature of 
things no such attribute i e as omnipotence can 
existf these are the words of ir woodward 
i very much question whether expressions infinitely 
less bold from other quarters would not be set down 
as absolute atheism by the same religious party who 
admire mr woodward such however is too often 
the inconsistency with vhich cavils are uiged agunst 
the freedom of inquiry which we must of necessity 
claim in any profitable discussion of the truths of 
natural theology 

in like manner writers of the calvinistic school 
have anxiously insisted on the want of any proofs of 
the infinite benevolence of the deity thus fortifying 
their system against the most obvious and forcible

olgoction drawn from the inconsistency with that 
attribute in supposing a condemnation to eternal 
misery without moral criminality in the irresponsible 
victim of reprobation or the jiossibility of effecting 
any ulterior good when the punishment is endless 
yet such persons would be the first to exclaim 
against putting any limitation on our notions of 
the divine power or wisdom as impious and athe 
irtieal 

limits of natural theology 

the general question as to the extent to which the 
conclusions of natural theology strictly and legiti 
mately reach has been the subject of much difference 
of opinion one class of reasoners have been prone 
to invest their inferences with a systematic com 
pleteness which is but illusory while the perception 
of this has afforded some colour to the opinion of 
others who have as strenuously denied that mere 
reasoning on these subjects can teach any substantial 
or satisfactory truths j 

and those vho do not go these lengths have 
contended that what we certainly learn from the 
admitted facts of order and acyustment in the 
material world is in truth very little that we caa 
advance only to the inference of the mere existence 
of some powerful intelligent cause that we can rise 
only to a vague apprehension of some superior power 
displayed in the adaptation of created things but

that ire am ascend no further as to any practical 
results that nre icam nothing more than as they 
term it a qaiescent intelligence that we can 
deduce nothing as to active superintendence of the 
world and the afiairs of men that in a word hatiiral 
theology teaches us nothing of a taond gtvoemor of 
accountable moral agents nothing of oar own natoro 
or destinies nothing of incorporeal exlstmoe or 
future state for all information on these subject 
th contend we must refer exciuritolj to rete

these arc undoubtcdlj questions not onlj moat 
fairly and legitimately open to diseusdon bnt of 
great moment and importance in a satisfactory 
analsis of the grounds of religions belief ocrtiunly 
great diversity of opinion has prevailed with rceect 
to them and it must be allowed may very reasoo 
ahly previul 

i vnw merely offer one remark as to the entire 
spirit and character of such inquiry i oonoeive it 
is an equally mistaken view to prosecute it as sup 
posing it to involve the credit either of nfttoral 
theology on the one hand or revelation on tbia 
other it neither at all affects the truth or valoe of 
natural theology to admit that it may be deficient 
in some points or that they may not properly belong 
to its province nor is it any disparagemeot to the

on the other side it does not appear to me at all 
essential to support the credit or enhance the per 
fections of divine revelation to make out that it is 
the atjy source of information on topics of this 
nature or to allow that reason may supply some 
first rudiments of religious knowledge on which it 
is the province of revelation to shed a full and 
abundant illumination

opposite views considered 

whatever difference of opinion may prevail as to 
the extent to which the inferences of natural 
theology may reach or the limits by which they 
must be circumscribed all rational inquirers on these 
topics i should conceive would agree in admitting 
at least some first elements of belief in a deity 
however imperfect and insuflicient as established by 
natural reason and it appears equally clear that 
not only any notion whatever of a revelation but 
even any statement or proposition of further reli 
pous truths beyond the primary doctrines of the 
existence and perfections of the deity must firom 
the nature of the case prestiqppose the truth of those 
primaiy doctrines and be actually based upon the 
evidence of their truth 

i again we look to the establishment of the 
eeiiences of revelation we must consider the essen 
tial bearing which our notions of the divine attri

butes have upon them this is not the place to 
enter npon the discussion of those evidences but 
in general it will be apparent on a mementos cond 
deration that the most material part of the argu 
ment for revealed religion if it is to be supported 
on the ground of miraculous testimony essenually 
turns upon our pmioui admissions with regard to 
the divine attributes from these alone do we 
obtain those preliminary ideas which confer sufficient 
probability on the notion of a disclosure of the 
divine will by supernatural interposition to render 
the question fiurly susceptible of an appeal to evi 
deuce and testimony a portion of the reasoning at 
once most essentially important yet very commonly 
overlooked and thus left open and defencelesi to the 
attacks of scepticism thus it becomes peculiarly 
important to scrutinize the extent to which natural 
theology can legitimately supply those considerations 
of antecedent probability which are absolutely 
necessary before we can entertain the question of 

these considerations seem to me so plain from 
the mere nature and reason of the thing that it 
would be hardly necessary to dwell upon them were 
it not that there are those as we have already in 
some manner noticed who in the strongest profes 
sions of a desire to support religion have systemati 
cally disparaged the claims of natural theology and 
decried the use of human reason in the investigation 
of divine tmuu

it is singular to notice the inconsistency of the 
objections entertained agsunst natural theology by 
diitcrent parties some complain of it as going too 
far others as not going far enough one party 
object to it as presumptuously usurping the place of 
revelation encouraging the selfsufficiency of intel 
lect and setting its followers above the instruction 
of the word of god as tending to lower the value 
of the mysterious truths of revelation aud to favour 
the rationalizing system of interpretation another 
party affect to despise natural theology and its phy 
meal proofs as grovelling among mere objects of 
sense and as restricting our contemplations to 
material things as defective in its doctrines leading 
us to no moral governor of the world inculcating no 
moral responsibility nor future state and thus prac 
tically differing little from no relijon 

it is decried at one time as vain and weak at 
another as arrogant and dangerous held in con 
tempt by those who are ignorant of its nature and 
dreaded by those who tremble at the dawn of truth 
and free inquiry for their own dogmas whether of 
atheism fanaticism or orthodoxy thus are parties 
so discordant unconsciously leagued in a common 
cause and we hear the language of objection and 
disparagement so precisely the same in the mouths 
of the orthodox and the infidel of the enthusiast 
and of the atheist that it is often impossible to 
distinguisli to which class the objector belongs

indispetuaue baus of retclatiou the only one which 
i hare been bupportcd even b thia show of argu 
mentt or recognising in any degree the iwcesaitj of 
rational evidence is in substance as follows 

suppose set of men who had arritcd at no belief 
in the truths of natural theology suppose a person 
cltuming to be a teacher of revelation to appeal 
among them working miracles would not it is 
asked those miracles prove rationally to such perscma 
that the individual was commisdoued from aome 
tuperior pouxr or being and thus when his system 
was unfolded and when it exhibited to them the 
doctrines commonly included in whiu is called 
natural theology they would then on rational 
evidence believe those truths along with the others 
revealed 

it must be recollected that the question is wholly 
one of etidence the case supposed is imagined only 
to represent more forcibly not what is or would be 
but what ought to be the correct coarse of reasoning 
it may be entirely admitted that the parties in 
question might embixtee the truths propounded to 
them this they might do on the mero strength of 
the teachers character authority and influence over 
their minds without any miracles or even evidenee

under the circumstances supposed would afford 
strict lojcal evidence of the teachers commission 
from sone superior being 

now in order to this it appears to me manifestly 
essential that not only the existence of some such 
being should be in the first instance recognised 
but aso the power of any beings however superior 
to suspend the laws of nature which to any one 
versed in physical inquiries would be the most diffi 
cult point of all and further that this would be 
done for the purpose of conveying a revelation 
which again must presuppose the power and will of 
such a being to make disclosures of religious truth 
all this must bo believed on good evidence before 
the teachers claim could be rationally received in 
other words it would imply a natural theology even 
of a veiy precise kind 

the case supposed is indeed almost an impos 
sibility since we can hardly conceive a people 
advanced enough to reason as the hypothesis re 
quires who had not attained to some idea of a 
suierior power or powers to whose influence em 
bodied perhaps in the person of the teacher they 
would directly ascribe the miracle but even in 
this case it is very likely that the result would be 
fiir from that of convincing them by evidence of the 
truths propounded the supposed working of the

miracle would not of itself be any proof of the 
ejpiitence of a superior beiug it would most natu 
rally and rationally be set down as merely an extra 
ordinary event which though not in the present 
power of the witnesses to exphun would most pro 
bably be accounted for by some future discoveries 
in nature or would be perhaps more properly 
ascribed to some hidden knowledge and superior 
skill possessed by the teacher who really or appa 
rently wrought it 

but those who have maintained this view of the 
matter have gone on to contend that in fiut there 
are other sources than those of the reasonings called 
natural theology from which a notion of the deity 
and his attributes may be acquired lliey have 
traced such a notion and belief up to what they con 
sider a natural constitution and tendency of the 
human mind an ultimate conviction of our souls a 
principle of belief in fact innate and manifested 
in the universal consent of mankind 

on all such views i have merely to observe that 
entirely allowing theact of such general persuaston 
and that it most commonly is nothing more than 
the undefined yet powerful kind of impression 
spoken of yet to assume that it is therefore an 
ifumte or ultimate principle of our nature is to beg 
the very question at issue the entire object of dis 
cussion in natural theology being to ascertain 
whether this conclusion cannot be lojcally analyied 
and the grounds of this persuasion investigated by

tracing the ictiniatc course and order of our obn 
victions from the elements of our knowledge of the 
mitural world through the inferences of order and 
adjustment up to that of design and intelligence 
and from the universality and unity of design up to 
the unity of designing intelligence from the im 
mensity of its plan to the infinite power of its 
author from those beneficial arrangements which 
we can recognise to liis providence from theinex 
pressible beauty and harmony of natural order to 
the perfections of the great source of it 

it seems in fiaut that to a confuaion of views 
between the admission of the existence of certain 
impressions and feelings in our minds and the pro 
cess of investigating them on the grounds of exact 
aigument and evidence may be traced many of the 
singular speculations occasionally obtruded on the 
world as profound metaphysicotheological reasoning 
many writers on these subjects seem not to keep 
steadily in view which course they dedre to follow 
whether to appeal to feelings or to anafyze them 

 

rational evidences of faith — variom qpmiom 

amsiderei 

it is of course perfectly notorious that the great 
mass of those who adopt even the purest finm of 
faith adopt it without any rational examinauon of 
evidence whether of natural or revealed truuu 
the appeal to natural imjtressions however just in 











and fhtical science to bevbltiom 

itself throws no light irhatever on the real question 
at issue which concerns not what men an led to 
believcy but the rational evidenee an toiicl they 
believe it not what are the natural iminessioiis 
but kow and why they should be impressed and 
this more especially with reference to the analysis 
of oacr own conyictions and the searching inquiry 
which we ouglit to make into the grounds of our 
own belief with all the light and information we 
possess in order that on the most vitally important 
of all subjects these convictions should be guarded 
by none but the most secure aiguments and 
repose on none but the most unassailable foun 
dations 

but the majority of those who decry this kind of 
inquiiy do so upon a more specific ground of faith 
lliey in hct discard all idea of reasoning upon the 
subject they look to a peculiar kind of impression 
upon the soul neither to be reasoned upon nor 
resisted in this their whole apprehension of the 
deity is made to consist thus all philosophical 
proof is useless and even dangerous all exercise of 
the intellect on such a subject is at variance with 
the demands of a true fitith with those who 
entertain such persuasions it is of course vain to 
dispute discarding reason they are insenttble to 
fidlades in argument but should any be diqposed 
to pause before wholly delivering themselves up to 
such views they might consent to be reminded 
even upon an authority which they must peculiariy

diligently seek him 

some again in an elevated spirit of religious 
devotion have contended that none but the true 
christian can derive any profitable evidences of the 
divinity from the contemplation of his works 
that he alone whose soul is enlightened purified 
and elevated to god by grace is able to perceive or 
to enjoy the manifestations of his existence and pre 
sence in nature thus they do not altogether con 
denm the study of nature but they mdntain that 
when the believer turns his thoughts to the proofs 
of the divine perfections in his visible works it is 
solely in obedience to the exhortations of scripture 
and valuable only as an exercise of the spirit of 
humble adoration inculcated in the bible and to be 
carried on with an entire submission to the language 
of scripture relative to physical subjectsf but 
though it is undoubtedly true that the spirit of 
christianity does thus elevate contemplations which 
would othervise be restricted to the level of mere 
conclusions of the understanding and render practa 
cally fruitful what would otherarise be the barren 
speculations of reason though a pure fiuth alone 
can add piety to philosophy and irradiate with joy 
and hope the contemplation of god in nature yet

that those conclusions in the first instance be sepa 
rately attained that those speculations however 
barren in themselves be first established on their 
own ground that there must first be a philosophy 
to aiford the external evidences of faith and an 
independent investigation of nature to furnish the 
means of tracing those indications of the deity 

opinions of this kind often take their rise in a 
zeal for certain particular views of religion con 
sidered to be inculcated by revelation but this 
with some diversity of principle 

one party to exalt the work of grace and the 
teaching of iuspimtiou would reject all conclusions 
of reason and in accordance with the peculiar 
scheme of spiritual illumination which they deduce 
from the bible would annihilate the carnal evidence 
of depraved sense to vindicate the miyesty of divine 
truth 

another school to uphold certain theories for 
which they claim the exclusive title of rational 
interpretations of scripture on quite opposite 
grounds would keep natural theology out of sights 
in oidcr to make revelation little else than a decia 
ration of the same truths 

both parties seek to uphold the credit of scrip 
ture according to the peculiar views they take of it 
the one by rejecting natural reason to exalt faith 
the other by making reason everything but explain 
ing away revelation into an identity with itf 

 sec nolo m t sec dr turious natural theolcsty p 






 relation of natural theology 

 to these may be added another school to whose 
views we may here briefly advert 

that system of theology which reduces all belief 
into an act of obedience to the authority of the 
church when thoroughly and consistently followed 
out to its logical consequences stands within itself 
complete and unassailable its advocates therefore 
can fearlessly afford to ve full scope to physical 
investigation raised far above all ajipeal to reason 
and not condescending to rest its claims on argu 
ment its infallibility cannot be in the slightest 
degree impaired by any ihilosophical inquiries even 
if they should terminate in conclusions the most 
hostile to the socalled evidences of revelation 

a system founded on such principles cannot be 
susceptible of any hostility towards scientific pur 
suits and as they confessedly do to a great 
extent afford support to natural theology they may 
even be made useful auxiliaries they may afford 
occupation to the restless activity of the human 
mind and thus withdraw men from inquiries of a 
more dangerous nature into things spiritual besides 
being susceptible of indirect application in the 
illustration of religious truths 

such would be the state of the case where these 
principles were fairly followed out such accord 
ingly u very much the feeling and practice in the 
roman catholic church

i have spoken of sudi a system if consulmfy 
followed up now pretensions of the same kind 
are maintained by a party among oursdves at the 
present day — who with all the assumptions just 
described fall short of their consistent consequenoea 
they refer to a relijous authority which discards 
reason yet is afraid to clum infallibility — whidi 
rejects human means of conyiction yet does not 
pretend to divine powers — which affects to com 
mand submission yet dreads the agitation of aiga 
ment hence in their eyes all scientific investigation 
is regarded with the utmost suspicion and hostili 
all inquiries into ihyical causes are either prone 
intrusions on forbidden ground or empty deludoni 
of blinded selfconceit and of the most fearful 
tendency they must therefore be discardedy or 
rather all science must be so modified as merely to 
hold a subordinate place in a great mystical system 
and be interpreted wholly in accorflance with 
certain high principles on which that system it 
founded if viewed otherwise it is dangerous and 
profime 

such appears to be the nature of their ideas on 
the subject whenever through the obscurity which 
envelopes the writings of this school we can catch 
a glimpse of their meaning hius we are told in 
history morals poetry legislation philosopkjf hiw 
guage physicsj religion — heaven and earth a body

of clay and a spirit breathed into its nostrils by the 
lifegiving spirit stand over against each other and 
whoso lifbctli not up the earthly to the heavenly will 
bring down the heavenly to the earthly homer 
says even a heathen transferred human things to 
the gods would he had rather things divine to 
manr if the body be not spiritualized the soul 
will be carnalized f 

it will be needless to comment on the entire con 
fusion in which such mysticism involves all rational 
evidence yet a system not claiming entire infalli 
bility cannot surely dispense with some appeal to 
such evidence if it really involve a reference to 
divine inspiration 

to an ordinary inquirer of plain sense and honest 
purpose a professed belief in revelation as such it 
would seem must in any sense imply a reference to 
its alleged evidences examined by reason and their 
testimony and its application must presuppose the 
existence attributes and providence of a revealing 
deity already known independently of revelation 
and therefore discovered and believed by the exer 
cise and conviction of our unaided intellectual facul 
ties employed in the study of his works 

in any way then this confounding together the 

respective provinces of reason and of faith leads 

men into equally manifest error and inconsistency

independence of scientific and revealed truth 

to those who would wish to see the edifice of 
religious truth reared upon a solid and unassailable 
foundatiouy it will surely not seem unimportant to 
dwell on the necessity of a due onler in the dispo 
sition of our proofs of making the belief in revelation 
depend on the secure support of natural theology 
and this again oh the truths elicited by inductive 
science and with this view carefully to distinguish 
the nature of scientific proof from that of religions 
belief and this is the more necessaiy since there 
are not wanting those who so fitr confound all sneh 
distinctions as not only to supersede natural theologj 
by revelation but even go a step further and lode 
to the bible as a source of instruction for the truths 
of natural science that is for those very truths on 
which natural theology rests and on which eons 
quently its own evidences ultimately depend tbera 
are some indeed who have professed to found entira

systems of philosophy avholly on the basis of ini 
authority others avho do not go this length at least 
from the peculiar view they adopt of the character of 
the inspired wtitings would mix up their authority 
with that of experimental proof and image either 
that the one or the other can receive an accesaon of 
evidence that that which is divine can be made 
more sure by human confirmation or that which has 
the evidence of sense more certain by the appeal to 
authority 

let us then look at the general distinction between 
the ground of science and of faith what is scientific 
inquiry and what are the objects we have in view 
in pursuing its investigations is not such inquiry 
necessarily limited to questions of fact and such 
discoveiy of laws and causes as we can legitimately 
deduce by strict reasoning upon those focts are 
not such objects exdusivdy those of truth as discover 
able by the sole use of our reasoning fisiculties if 
then we either adopt any other standard whatsoever 
in stich questions or pursue our inquiries by a reference 
to any other authority whatsoever than solely that of 
inductive inference from observed phenomena we 
are deviating from the proper line of sdentifie 
inquiry we are renouncing the principles of the 
inductive philosophy altogether 

yet that which is no guide in matters of science 
may be the highest standard of truth in reference to 




i 




and putsical ciengb to revelation 

matters trhich properly beknig to its province the 
truths of revelation received npon their proper 
moral evidence evince their diine excellence when 
directed to the high and peculiar ends for which 
they are designed but the moment we so entirely 
mistake their object as to iply them to the purposes 
of philosophic instruction our inquiries lose every 
characteristic of rational or consistent investigation 
scientific and revealed truth are of essentially 
different nauire and if we attempt to combine and 
unite them we are attempting to unite things of a 
kind which cannot be consolidated and shall infidlibly 
injure both in a word in physical science we must 
keep strictly to physical induction and demonstra 
tion in religious inquiry to moral proof but never 
confound the two together when we follow 
observation and inductive reasoning our inquiries 
lead us to mence when we obey the authority of 
the divine word we are not led to science but to 
faith the mistake consists in confounding these 
two distinct objects together and imagining that 
we are pursuing science when wo introduce the 
authority of revelation they cannot be combined 
without losing the distinctive character of both if 
£uth is to be our guide to natural truth at ah it 
must be whoby so if we appeal to its authority at 
all on points of natural science we must adopt it as 
our sole authority we must renounce all guidance 
of reason all appeal to the evidence of sense if we 
are to reject the results of observation and the

evidence of our reason on one point we in fact give 
up the principle of making them our guides to truth 
that is vro give up the principle and ground of all 
experimental knowledge of all independent search 
into the works of the creator and by consequence 
of all rational proof of his existence and thus ulti 
mately of his revelations too 

to the connexion of physical causes and the order 
of the material creation we appeal for the evidences 
of the divine existence and perfections until we 
have proof of a deity we can have none of a reve 
lation upon the proofs of natural religion those 
of revelation essentially depend to give the latter 
then any share whatever in determining the former 
is to make the premises depend on the conclusion 
the evidences of natural religion are derived from 
physical knowledge to assume then the authority 
of scripture as in the slightest degree applicable to 
prove the order of physical causes and the laws of 
the material creation is to make revelation the basis 
of natural theology— r in other words to b the 
question to vitiate the whole argument and to 
destroy all rational evidence yet it would really 
seem that there are some who do not see the 
contradiction of such a course — of believing in reve 
lation without first believing in god of receiving a 
doctrine as declared from him before we prove that 
he is for such is precisely the proceeding of those 
who look to the bible as such for instruction in the 
science of nature they do not seem to percdve 



kstmsm 



and physical baence to revelation 

that the arguments of nataral theology mnst from 
the nature of the case be indepmimu of the truth of 
revelation and that consequently the evidences of 
physical trtuh on which the former wholly depend 
must be in like manner sought for intupendentfy of 
the authority of saipture to allow the opporite 
course is to entangle the chain of reasoning in 
hopeless confusion and to make the whole evidence 
of religion an argument in a cirde 

this essential independence of scripture and 
physical science is the more necessary to be attended 
to because though it has not been overlooked by 
some writers yet it has not been generally main 
tained upon its riyht basis and it appears in 
reference to some floating opinions of tbe present 
time peculiarly needful to insist upon this distinction 
so essential to the stability of the evidences of 
natural theology and by consequence to those of 
revelation also yet so strangely misconceived and 
practically denied by some parties at the present

the observations which i have thus r made have 
referred to any the most general notion which can 
be entertained of a revelation of divine truth in 
whatever we may imagine it to consist or by what 
ever means conveyed they will however apply 
with equal force when we proceed to consider the 
nature and mode of such communications of divine 
truth in a more precise sense when we advance to 
the examination of that particular view of revelation 



mstiiimimininvmiem inn dtr i muvm i rnr in nrt ¦ uni mi miiii iu 




 belation of natural theoloot 

avhich consists iii the adoption of the volume of the 
bible as its sole authentic record and depository 

and this view of the subject naturally and imme 
diately brings us to the examination of a ikint of 
considerable importance bearing upon the connexion 
of natural and revealed truth and which arises out 
of the more particular notion of revelation to which 
we are now referring — the question of certain real 
or alleged contradictions between the results of 
physical investigation and the language of the bible 
and the attempts which have been made to reconcile 
them 

among those who admit the general truth of the 
foregoing remarks— who allow when it is distinctly 
put to them that the laws of nature in order to 
become evidences of a deity must be established on 
independent grounds there are yet those who feel 
difficulties with regard to certain scriptural expres 
fdons many who fully acknowledge when it is 
pressed upon them the fallacy of making the truth 
of scripture the basis of its own evidence yet still 
feel considerably perplexed by alleged discrepanciei 
between science and revdation they still seem to 
think the cause of religion in danger unless the 
language of all parts of the bible can be brought 
into exact accordance with the facts and laws dis 
covered in the natural world and would thus hazard 
its entire credit ujion the chance of contradiction 
which may arise at every fresh disclosure of physical 
disooveij 







and physical science to revelation 

in any ikint of view this is certainly to evince a 
most disjianiging estimate of the evidences of reve 
lation if not to cast a direct reflection on them and 
betrays a singular misconception of its spirit and 
object those avho most fully and rationally appre 
ciate the evidences and nature of christianity will 
be the fiist to ierccive and to allow that its stability 
can be in no way injured by the pursuit of physical 
truth or the existence of those contradictions so 
much referred to between the letter of the scriptural 
representations of the order of creation and the 
visible existing monuments of the changes which the 
earths surface lias undergone before the date of the 
human race 

we might indeed infer this even upon the 
getieral truth of the foregoing remarks for we 
have thus seen that to suppose revelation a guide to 
physical truth would involve us in a petitio principii 
it camiot possess any authority on such points 
without vitiating the whole train of evidence of 
religion both natural and also revealed 

hence then it follows by direct inference that if 
any representation in scripture be at variance with 
the truths elicited in the natural world such discre 
pancy cannot be really injurious to the maintenance 
of the proper spiritual authority of revelation nor 
can it in the least vitiate its claims as a disclosure of 
moral and religious truth

indeed the existence of such contradictions maj 
serve to warn the inquirer against arguing in a circle 
as reminding him that revelation oiigju not to be 
appealed to for physical truth since he thus perceives 
that in these instances it cannot 

attempts to combine philosophy and scripture 

the slightest consideration of the subject in accord 
ance with the principles already laid down might 
suffice to any unprejudiced and reasonable inquirer 

still however there are some avho cannot feel 
satisfied and under a confused impression which 
they entertain of the relation between physical and 
revealed truth are impatient of even any apparent 
contradiction between them and anxiously catch at 
any means of reconciling them it will therefore 
be desirable to make a few further remarks on these 
discreimncies and attempted reconciliations 

the history of past ages supplies us with familiar 
examples of the spirit in which such questions were 
viewed we well know how the letter of religious 
authority was appealed to in opposition to the dis 
coveries of astronomy but though these are not 
the very same points which occupy attention at the 
present day yet the principle involved is identically 
the same whether we are to adhere to the letter 
of scriptural representation in opposition to the tes 
timony of inductive research or whether it is safe 
rational or consistent with an enlightened and well 




and phtsigal ktencb to bevelation 

grounded fiiitli to stake the reception or rejection 
of christianity on the credit of these particular 
expressions is still the question 

without dwelling on the instances of the wild 
speculators of past ages who deduced phjncal sys 
tems on the authority of what they considered the 
doctrines of revelation and firamcd schemes of phi 
losophy on principles which essentially destroyed its 
claims to being philosophy we may find that in 
fact even at the present day there are not wanting 
disciples of such a school nor even among the pro 
fessed followers of science those who seriously con 
struct and maintain such systems which are in foct 
neither systems of fiuth nor philosophy but a com 
bined perversion of both 

but it will neither be necessary nor pleasing to 
dwell on such speculations even among those who 
are most ready to allow their unreasonableness we 
may discover many who entertain views which are 
the very same in the principle on which they are 
framed 

to adopt the very notion of expecting or wishing 
to find in scripture any confirmation of the results 
of inductive science — to attach importance to 
accordances between the descriptive or poetical 
language of the bible and the conclusions of phi 
losophy on the one hand or to consider the want 

such accordances as any objection on the other to 

seek to prop up the credit the sacred writers on 
the verbal coincidences with phyncal results or 



 i iw il jl ip 




 relation of natural theology 

think it endangered bj the violation of such coin 
cidence all this is in fact the veiy same thing in 
principle as to make revelation the guide to phi 
losophy it is to imagine the letter of its language 
the proper evidence of physical truth the very 
same mistaken principle of reasoning then is charge 
able on those who construct systems of philosophy 
out of the bible and those who attempt to force its 
language into accordance with philosophical results 
the very same misconception of the distinct nature 
and grounds of religious and scientific truth is 
evinced equally in the speculations of the hutchin 
sonian school of a past age and those of the bible 
geologists of the present day 

it may indeed be true with regard to the system 
of gravitation and the motion of the earth that it is 
not nowthought necessaiyto enter into the discussions 
of biblical criticism to find support for them nor on 
the other hand imagined that the admission of them 
is dangerous to the authority of faith still the very 
same principle has been and still is adopted by a 
great number of writers with regard to the facts of 
geology and the account of the creation as conveyed 
in certain passages of the old testament whether 
the particular point in question be the nature of 
gravitation and the production of light or the 
motion of the earth and stability of the sun the 
speculations thus raised are still only exemplifica 
tions of the very same spirit which has dictated 
similar questions connected with the results of geo

logy and pliysiology so much agitated at the present 
day and ike right view of these most alike be 
dependent upon the very same rational conndera 
tions which are now generally allowed to apply in 
the more obvious cases respecting the system of the 
world 

distinct objects of betdahan 

even in the most general point of view and with 
out at present entering upon any more precise dis 
tinctions whatever may be the peculiar view enter 
tained as to the nature of a divine revelation it 
must assuredly be allowed that its object and aim 
must be essentially distinct from the inculcation of 
physical truth uikn almost any conception which 
may be adopted of those objects we ask what pos 
sible reference can the physical expressions used by 
the sacred vriters bear to the religious truths which 
it was their object to communicate t 

common sense surely suggests the rule that what 
is but incidental in any case should be fidrly viewed 
apart from what is the main object for example 
the character of a history as such is in no way com 
promised though the author may happen to use 
terms of art incorrectly the conclusiveness of 
scientific research is in no way impaired by inacen 
racies of stjle in many of the most famous master 
pieces of design the arust has fallen into incon 
gruities and anachronisms yet the most acute 
critics are foremost to admit that this in no degreisi 




grtfa •• ••¦irp j rj 




 relation of natural theology 

spoils tlie force aud beauty of the painting one 
and the same reason evidently applies in all these 
cases viz that these defects occur only in what is 
but incidental to the design and distinct from the 
main object in view 

to expect to find the truths of science declared 
by revelation or to feel a difficulty when the forms 
of expression adopted by the sacred writers are con 
tradicted by the facts elicited in nature is as un 
reasonable as it mould be to expect to find the theo 
rems of euclid enforced by act of parliament or if 
in the statutes we should chance to meet with any 
expression not mathematically correct either to con 
demn euclid as illegal or to think it necessary for 
vindicating the majesty of the laws to resort to all 
the arts of siecial pleading for explaining away the 
discrepancy scriptural geology is as preposterous 
in principle as statutable geometry by the same 
rule we ought to criticise poetry on the grounds of 
metaphysics and establish the processes of che 
mistry by the precepts of rhetoric 

yet to allow that these are absurdities is no dis 
paragement either to law or mathematics to poetry 
or to metaphysics to chemistry or rhetoric con 
sidered in themselves it is only in the attempt to 
combine them that the absurdity arises each in 
their proier way and directed to their proper pur 
poses are excellent it is only when we apply the 
one for the purikses of the other that we act 
absurdly both are perverted abusedt and iijared

lilj object in these remarks has been rather to 
point out and discuss the great prineipk of the ques 
tion than its details to pkce the whole subject on 
what i conceive to be its right ground rather than 
to follow up any minor points connected with it 
and it is chiefly as conducting their aigument upon 
those details instead of looking to princiflet that 
i find fault with most writers who liave treated on 
tlie subject even if we should allow that in some 
instances the attempts to reconcile the letter of 
scripture vaih the facts of geology have been inge 
nious and plausible and supported vnfih consider 
able skill and learning still the objection which i 
entertain against them would remain in full foroe 
being directed against the radical defect of ihevtfirh 
principle the idea of seeking for such an accordance 
at all and the utter improbability that it should 
have been contemplated in the delivery of the 
judaical law or in the mosaic history 



low views of betelaticm 

such considerations it might be hoped would 
satisfy any dispassionate inquirer but it is unfor 
tunately obvious that a variety of causes interfere 
to render many professed followers of christianity 
insensible to the reasonableness of these views 
adopting their creed blindly from education cus 
tom or party too many hold their religion only by 
a most loose and uncertain tenure and are lamen

tably confused in their notions of its nature hence 
they dread a formidable shock to christianity in 
every physical discovery and in the obscurity irhich 
surrounds them imagine danger to the truth in every 
exposure of error insensible to the real strength 
of their position they live in groundless alarm for 
its security and accustomed to cherish faith in 
ignorance they apprehend in every advance of 
knowledge the approach of the enemy of their 
salvation 

too many nominal christians entertain onlf the 
most miserable idea of the nature of the gospel 
they profess to believe their only notion too often 
consists in a confused general impression of a certain 
sacredness in scripture which produces little effect 
beyond that of making them afraid to enter its pre 
cincts and search its recesses for themselves and 
yet more fearful lest its sanctity shotdd be invaded 
by others 

and their dread of openly encountering any con 
tradictious and their anxious desire to shelter them 
selves under even the most frivolous explanations if 
it does not betray a lurking distrust of the proper 
evidences of their faith at least evinces the lowest 
and most unworthy conceptions of the spirit and 
meaning of the bible and an almost total absence 
of due distinction between the design and applica 
tion of the several portions of which it ip made up 

that such misconception should prevail is indeed 
a lamentable but not a surprising instance of the 



fig la i ¦ i • l j

liability of liuman nature to misapply the best gifts 
whether of providence or grace and its influence 
has been unhappily cherished and confirmed by the 
prevalence of those theological systems which hate 
dictated the practice of kteixdiziug upon all the 
expressions of the sacred ititers so that the magi 
nificent imagery of the finest passages of inspiration 
is reduced to the lowest standard of verbal dog 
matism and minds incapable of appreciating the 
divine sublimity of those descriptions think to add 
to the evidence of their truth by a forced and unnm 
tural perversion of their meaning 

with others again the sincere but as we musfc 
consider it misguided spirit of religious fiuiatioim 
produces similar effects blinded to all but the 
internal light of his spiritual impressions the enthu 
siast will always entertain a deeplyrooted and 
devoted hostility against any such distinctions af 
those here advocated maintiuning the literal 
application of every sentence every syllable of the 
divine word he rejects as impious the slightest 
departure from it human reason along with all 
science which is its offspring is at best carnal and 
unsanctified and should any of its conclusions be 
advanced in contradiction to the letter of a scrip 
tural text this completely seals its condemnation af 
absolutely sinful and equivalent to a njection of 
revelation altogether 

in such cases we may most readily make every 
allowance due to sincerity however mistaken but 

r t

there are other instances in which unfortunately 
little clium to such indulgence can be foutid there 
are some who join most yebementlj in the crj 
against science in general and geology in particular 
as dangerous to religion tqnm no sincere gnunds of 
rdigioum contichon 

their adoption of a certain form of faith is dic 
tated by motives of ejepedien and the mere value 
of its practical effects on society not themselves 
recognising its claims as founded in trutii they 
uphold the established creed as weu as all received 
errors popularly engrafted upon it as a convenient 
and effectual instrument for securing the influence 
of practical restraints on the multitude hence 
they condemn all inquiries which may come into 
collision with any portion of the popular belief and 
against the agitation of any question which may 
shake established prejudices or suggest any distinc 
tions in the application of scripture there is an 
immediate and indiscriminate cry raised that they 
unsettle mens minds and are heretical doctrines of 
a most dangerous tendency and such as will weaken 
and eflbce all sense of religious and moral obli 
gation 

but even among the best men and most sincere 
ielievers there exists too often a sort of dread of 
meeting such questions in a strictly honert frame of 
mind those who have the most conscientious 
regard for truth in everything else seem to think it 
dispensed with in supporting the cause of religion

duced in supikrt of the received fiuth are jet thonr 
selves influenced by the very same npint only in a 
different form in dreading the dissemination of

the one party seeking to support religion by the 
propagation of falsehood the other by the sup 
pression of truth both agree in treating truth as if it 
were falsehood and thus give its enemies the fiiirest 
ground to think it so 

geological interpretation of scripture 

from what we have already seen of the invaluable 
evidence supplied by geology to the great truths of 
natural theolog and thence to the foundations of al 
religion we shall be prepared to allow its high 
importance we must further have perodved in 
going through even the mere outline of that evidence 
the positive inferences which it involves and on 
which it indeed founded as to the gradual intro 
duction of the present order of things and the existing 
species of organized beings out of previous forms of 
existence and it is manifest that this is apparently 
at least in direct opposition to the literal and obvi 
ous sense of the representations giveq of the procesa 
of creation at once out of darkness and confusiont 
at a recent epoch given in several passages of th 



and physical science to revelation 



boldly to front the difficulty and avow tbe contra 
diction in plain terms but instead of this we observe 
them exerting their utmost ingenuity to elnde the 
contradictions either by disguising the ffulu or 
glossing over the toordn with the most flimsy inter 
pretations 

it would indee apjiear extraordinary that the 
notion of looking for modem science in the ancient 
scriptures should be found satisfactory to any lerson 
of ordinary sense were it not that we discover many 
causes which tend in this case to blind the clearest 
erceptions the subject when simly and calmly 
considered is plain and hardly open to misappre 
hension but men cannot be brought to consider it 
simply and calmly yet what mode of proceedinj 
can be more irrational passages are quoted from 
vritings produced ages before any of the fiicts of 
geology were understood and now that they are 
knovn the critic sets about to make those jiassages 
speak the language of modem science 

these writings constitute the delivery of a reli 
gious system to the israelites and now men try to 
make them supply astronomical and geological 
instruction to christians 

in all this the object is so palpably mistaken that 
weie the suggestions of the critic ever so happy and 
the expositions themselves ever so luminous and 
natural we could not attach any serious weight to 
them but when we come to observe in the 
minority of such cases how entirely gratuitous

the theories and how miserably stndned the verbal 
interpretations which are necessary in order to effect 
the accordance the whole attempt must appear yet 
more manifestly futile for let us only dwell for a 
moment on the nature of these interpretations 

when a commentator of the present day sets 
about to put a particular interpretation on a jmssage 
in an ancient author he may upon an examination 
of the critical sense of the words and the construction 
of the sentence make out a meaning which to aim 
is plausible and in itself consistent but there is 
another question entirely distinct from this too often 
quite overlooked but essentially imiotant to a true 
interpretation viz whether it is probable from 
concurrent circumstances that this was the sense 
in hmt of fact actually ifuended by the author it is 
one thing to make out such a sense as to our appre 
hcnsion the uhmxis may bear quite another to infer 
that this was the sense really in tlte mind of the 
writer 

now in the geological inteqiretatiou of scripture 
this consideration seems strangely overlooked al 
lowing for a moment that the verbal construction or 
tlie proiosed sense is one which the passage may be 
made to bear where is the probability that it was the 
bitended eignijicatum f 

supposing it granted that by some critical process 
these descriptions may be brought to take a verbal 
sense accordant with the facts elicited by geology 
still the question is can we soberly bring ourselves

if bat a moments conmdcration be bestowed on 
the circumstances of the case can it be seiiousl 
imagined that the delivery of the juducal law wta 
really intended to embrace the doctrines of geology 
and this too under the guise of expressions which iq 
tlieir obvious sense are directly contradictory to thoa 
doctrines is it on any ground conceivable that 
such a purpose could have been in view in the 
delivery of any divine revelation and much less in 
that vouchsafed to the israelites and if it were 
could any method be devised more adverse to its 
accomplishment for we are thus driven to suppose 
a design of revealing certun truths by effectually 
concealing them since we know tliat in point of 
ct the hidden sense was not disclosed and ont 
the time of moses doamwards no one has ever 
imagined the secret meaning of the description till 
the present day and when disclosed it afibrdi no

representation of the creation in genesis 

with a total disregard to all such considerations as 
those last adduced we find a certain school of inter 
preters of scripture continually labouring to make 
out some sense of the terms in which the creation is 
described in the first chapter of genesis to make it 
square with truths which could not have been in 
contemplation in the delivery of the narrative and 
exhausting every resource of critical skill to force 
the language of the representation into accordance 
with facts now attested by the oiganic remains of 
former orders of existence which could not have 
been intended to be represented 

formerly the geological interpreters were engaged 
in taxing to the utmost the powers of philology 
to convert the six days into periods of millions of 
years notwithstanding that they are described 
precisely as alternations of day and night and that 
this is absolutely implied is the very puriose of the 
whole description since the six days must manifestly 
be taken in the same sense as the seventh on the 
other hand they had to exert not less ingenuity to 
make the order of geological epochs accord with 
these periods this scheme however was at length 
fbund to answer the views of neither party the 
theological critic could not admit such strained 
and dangerous interpretation and the advance of 
geological research soon showed every one that there 
were in fietct no such marked epochs in the sacoessive

fonnatioii or in tbe introdaction of ae races of

at the present daj another riew has leeeited the 
sanction of some eminent names and has obtained 
considerable currency it has been oonoeited that 
the narrative in genesis is intended to describe 
separateljy in few words in the first terser the 
original creation of all things after this the inde 
finitely long history during which all the changes 
indicated by geology took place is passed over in 
silence a new period then commences which may 
be imderstood according to the literal order of the 
narrative provided some latitude be allowed in the 
interpretation of the terms a states if not of 
darkness and chaos yet at least temporary disorder 
and obscurity was produced and the work of the 
existing creation or at least reprodiiction and 
arrangement then commenced and was continued 
as described in the following part of the chapter and 
perfected in six natural days 

now without entering upon the grounds of such 
an interpretation i will merely observe looking 
only to the verbal construction how very wide a 
latitude in the meaning of words must be allowed 
before we can affix such a sense as this to a repre 
sentation so precise and circumstantial and eveij 
reader of the slightest taste and discernment will 
surely at once exclaim against it as totally at variance

such a terdon can appear satisfaetoiy who can 
believe that this is what moses reallj intended to

this magnificent composition from the philosophical 
theory to the obvious tenour and train of this most 
sublime imagery to be fully satisfied as to the 
meaning intended to be conveyed a meaning totally 
distinct from anything philosophical or bearing the 
most remote reference to any anticipations of geolo

another view of the matter has been proposed by 
an eminent philosopher which amounts to an admis 
sion that it is impossible at the present day to fix 
an certain meaning on compositions of such anti 
quity and so entirely destitute of all elucidation 
from contemikrai writings as tlie mosaic records 
such an idea of course has called forth no small 
censure but surely even this is scarcely more 
destructive to all definite interpretation than versions 
like those we have just mentioned — sach an idea 
honestly avowed is surely prefisrable to the indirect

introduction of principles which fairly carried oat 
may enable us to fix upon auj given passage any 
required sense 

i am assuming that the inquirer and interpreter 
are both sincere seekers of truth if indeed the 
object be instead of discovering truth to say some 
tiling plausible to satisfy prejudice and avoid giving 
oifence to popular belief there is no limit to the 
inventions which men will not readily swallow down 
if only made palatable to their prepossessions 

admission of contradictions 

let the appeal be made to any reader of ordinary 
sense not prepossessed in favour of a theoiy and it 
seems to me impossible that he can understand the 
description whether in the shorter form of the 
decalogue or the more expanded of genesis con 
sidered simply as to its terms otherwise than as 
presenting a magnificent picture of almighty power 
and emboding the representation of one original 
entire simple universal act of divine interposition 
at once and for the first time fiaming and calling into 
being and operation out of previous universal darkness 
and confusion the heavenly bodies as well as the 
earth and all the races of organized beings upon it in 
the actual progressive stages assigned to the six days 
specially described as literally such even if we 
allow the separation of the first verse as a distinct 
account of an earlier creation which to my appre

hension seems a very forced dissociation of the 
members of a sentence still in the second yerse 
the entire tenour of this unrivalled imagery seems 
incapable of conveying any other impression than 
that of the total absence of all organized existence 
and the prevalence of universal confusion and total 
darkness until the work of the first day com 
menced 

now when we refer to geology as indeed has 
already been rendered sufficiently manifest the 
sure monuments which we derive from the study of 
organic remains disclose to us eidences of a series 
of gradual changes and repeated creative processes 
going on without any one sudden universal inter 
vention or creation of the existing world out of the 
ruins of a former geology shows that in none of 
its epochs least of all in the later has any universal 
elemental change occurred or any trace been left of 
even a temporary chaos followed by a simultaneous 
universal restitution of things 

comparing then these indisputable conclusions 
with the representations in the hebrew scriptures 
to whatever extent critical skill may stretch the 
meamng there is an insupeiaue discrepancy in the 
most material points of the description we in 
truth gain nothing whatever by critical refinements 
so long as the passage be admitted to describe a 
tadden universal interposition of divine power for

the formation out of previous confusion of a world 
iteopled with organized life in its existing format at a 
xriod correiknding to the origin of the human 
race according to the received chronology 

the contradiction is scarcely less palpable in these 
more refined and farfetched versions than in the 
vulgar sense 

surely then instead of attempting to tamper with 
all rules of common sense in the interpretation it 
would be far better at once honestly to allow that 
we cannot reconcile the description to the facts nor 
find the original of the picture in nature surely 
looking as well at the plain and obvious sense in 
which any unprejudiced reader would of necessity 
view the scriptural representations as at the forced 
and unsatisfactory nature of the interpretations as 
also at the manifest unreasonableness of the very 
principle on which any such inteipretation can be 
rendered desirable — on every consideration we shall 
see the better and wiser course of openly acknow 
ledging the contradiction and allowing the impos 
sibility of making out an accordance between the 
literal six days work of creation and the visible 
evidences and existing monuments of it — between 
the letter of the representation either as given in 
the delivery of the decalogue to the israelites or as 
subsequently expounded by moses in the book of 
genesis and the perceptible and observable order 
of the works of the same divine being from whom 
the judaical dispensation emanated

i have been particular in stating plainly and 
unreservedly the exact nature and extent of the 
contradiction between the language of the word ot 
god delivered to the hebrews and that of the 
monuments which we now extract from his works 
it seems to me peculiarly needful so to set it fortht 
and not to shrink from the open and honest avowal 
of it— especially while we recollect that the physical 
evidence which thus palpably contradicts the letter 
of the scriptural representation is the veiy same 
which establishes the truth of the divine perfections 
and proves the fact of creation however different in 
its mode of accomplishment from what our precon

now so far as regards the first chapter of genesis 
we may remark that even those divines who adopt 
the most approved views of the nature of inspiration 
may and do allow that an inspired teacher mighty in 
irrelevant points be left to his own unassisted 
convictions and on such matters would be no more 
enlightened than his contemporaries many eminent 
divines have even admitted that current opinions 
and prejudices though erroneous might yet be 
adopted and turned into a vehicle of moral and 
religious instruction to those to whom they were

and physical ci£nc£ to revelation 



habitual without derogation to the inspired 
of the teacher 

on such a ground we might cei 
to regard the first chapter of genesis as embodting 
what were the commonly received ideas among the 
jews borrowed perhaps from some poetical cosmo 
gonj and which moses was inspired to adapt and 
apply to the ends of religious instruction — to the 
assertion of the miyestj power and unity of the 
creator and the prohibition of the worship of false 
gods especially of those animals and other material 
objects which were peculiarly pointed out as being 
merely the creatures of the true god and this 
doubtless in a more particular enumeration because 
they were especially the objects of that idolatrous 
worship into which the israelites were so prone to 
relapse the entire description being thus divested 
of the attributes of a real history the concluding 
portion of it the account of the solemnization of 
the seventh day as the sabbath is of course equally 
divested of an historical character and thus cannot 
be understood as referring to any primieval institu 
tion and can therefore only be regarded as having 
been designed for the more powerful enforcement of 
that institution on the jews and this indeed would 
be no more than accords with the opinion of many 
of the most approved commentators who on quite 
independent critical and theological grounds have 
regarded the passage genesis ii conveying that

institution as correctly to be understood in a pro 
leptical or anticipatory sense 

perhaps sucli an accommodation might be made 
to the ignorance of the jews in the introduction of 
the htw in order to avoid the unnecessary difficulty 
of a collision with invincible prepossesrions on sub 
jects irrelevant to the purpose of the law and which 
in fact would but have tended to make thn rgect 
it it may also be contended that in general any no 
tion of a divine communication implies adaptatian to 
the ideas language habits dispositions and opinions 
of the parties addressed since words and existing 
notions and prevalent modes of belief of necestdty 
form the only means and channels of communicating 
the religious truths intended to be conveyed thus 
in such a case the introduction of views in tliemselves 
at variance with truths since elicited is compatible 
vnth the veracity of the inspired teacher and the 
absence of such a knowledge as has since been 
obtained of facts which did not concern the tenour 
of his particular commission is without difficulty 
recondleable with his inspired and inuible know 
ledge of the truths which it was his province to 
communicate 

some veriters indeed have felt no repugnance 
even to the idea of an adaptation on tlie part of an 
inspired teacher to the prejudices and eiiorb knovm 
by him to be such of his hearers though others 
on the contrary cannot conceive or allow aoch an

much more with the indwelling of the spirit fif

of such views and their incidental adoption as a

but the great difficulty in the present 
from the circumstance of the same main statement 
occurring in a more brief and pointed form in the 
delivery of the decalogue here it is manifest the 
same considerations mill no longer avail for admis 
sions which might be allowed with respect ton homan 
teacher divinely inspired would not ipty in the 
instance of a direct declaration by the divine voice 
and actual inscription by the divine act 

it is needless to enlarge on the difficulties nith 
which the subject is surrounded it involves a 
question of the most serious moment from its exten 
sive application in theology which is foroed upon 
us by the consideration of the present snigeet and 
has also claimed much attention as bearing widely 
upon the character of other divine commnnioationa

and to what extent wo can consistent bdieve the 
deity to have adopted the course of aoeonunodating

his communications to the existing prejudices and 
belief even when erroneous of the parties addressed 

without pretending here to discuss the general 
question i would merely ask what is the least 
objectionable course to pursue f 

in every rock we trace inllible monuments of 
the progress of creation we truly read the records 
in tables of stone inscribed with finger of ckkl 
when we compare those with documents of a 
different kind we are compelled to acknowledge the 
visible inscriptions and the written representation 
to be at direct variance so long as the historical 
character of that representation be insisted on the 
only alternative is to admit that it was not intended 
for an historical narrative and if the represen 
tation cannot have been designed for literal history 
it only remains to regard it as having been intended 
for the better enforcement of its objects in the 
language of figure and poetry — and to allow that 
the manner in which the deity was pleased to reveal 
himself to the jews as accomplishing the work of 
creation was like so many other points of their 
dispensation veiled in the guise of apologue and 
parable and that only a more striking representation 
of the greatness and miyesty of the divine power 
and creative wisdom was intended by embodying 
the expression of them in the language of dramatie

importance of tke quedum 

but without insisting on these or the like sugges 
tions as entirely satisfactory i vrill only further 
observe in general that with reference to prevailing 
opinions the subject is manifestly of a nature which 
cannot be safely neglected or passed by but which 
all friends to truth are most imperatively called upon 
to examine fully and candidly in the present times 
when it is continually being brought more widelj 
into public notice 

its importance is indeed now beginning to be 
generally acknowledged it is in vain that one 
party may endeavour to gloss over the difficulties or 
to dismiss them with some vague general remark 
and another go into the minuteness of critical 
details for finding some hardlystrained verbal con 
struction into which the phraseology of the sacred 
narrative may be tortured to effect a reconciliation 
or a third seek to mislead the public by ftlse and 
absurd misrepresentations of the geological evi 
dence these attempts may perhaps for the 
moment obtain the assent of the unreflecting reader 
and for a time lead blindfold the opinions of the 
many by the authority of some eminent name or 
supply a convenient form of words under the shelter 
of which the believer may exempt himself from the 
necessity of inquiry and repose from the labour of 
thought and in which the sceptic may find himself 
provided with a convenient disguise of approved and

orthodox exposition the flimsiness of which will 
only disclose itself in proportion to the penetration 
of those around him 

but the success of such expedients cannot be 
lasting and the question must soon come to be dis 
cussed in its naked simplicity if such attempts at 
explanation as those alluded to have successively 
amused for a time the public mind yet that one 
has in turn yielded to another shows that the pro 
gressive disclosiues of geological discovery have 
tended more and more to extend the dominion of 
sound inductive principles nevertheless some of 
those expositions which have recently obtained most 
popularity have not been without their use in 
exploding the more gross errors of those which pre 
ceded them and in some measure preparing the way 
for the truth thus mens minds were formerly 
startled at the bare notion of longcontinued periods 
and successive dynasties of organized life before the 
creation of man the theory of the days inters 
preted as periods of indefinite length had at 
least the recommendation that it got over one main 
part of the novelty and difficulty and some notion 
of the immense duration of the globe became in a 
certain degree familiarized to mens minds as asso 
ciated with the scripture use of the terms day 
and • year 

they were consequently now less incapable of 
listening to the disclosures of geological researeht 
and less shocked at the boldness with which indoo

it may also he remarked inth satisfaction that in 
some of tlie latest and now most trideljcirculated 
of these expositions there has appeared a hi more 
distinct reference to the genuine authority of induc 
tire jirinciples an acknowledgment of its rightful 
claims within its own protjnce we may also per 
ceive a dibositiou to less minute attempts at precise 
interpretation and an adoption of more vague and 
indefinite language in statements bearing at all upou

gist endeavoured to commit himself no fiirtiier than 
was absolutely necessary while be silently passed 
by those topics on which a definite statement would 
be unavoidably offensive and when he cleariy saw 
that all attempts at explaining it away would be 
impracticable 

and though views not unlike those before leferred • 
to and commented upon have been at least in some 
degree adopted by several eminent geologists yet all 
the more judicious have carefully avoided direct and 
pointed affirmation of what they well know to be 
bo much at variance with geological evidence as the 
occurrence of an univeraal chaos folhtwcd by

logists seem to me to have acted most nsely who

in its real character would assume a far simpler 
aspect than it too commonly does and would occa 
sion no serious embarrassment in the minds of any 
thinking disciples of the gospel whose views are 
not mixed up with the very common prepossessions 
as to the meaning and application of the old testar 
ment hence it is that men are startled at the 
announcement of the discrepancies vre have been 
considering and from the prevalence of those opi 
nions alone it is that the question assumes so peeu

is at least clear that the representations in question

apprehensions of the israelites as they are utterij 
unsuited to us at the present daj 

but distinctions of this kind are bj no means 
generally understood among professing christiana 
and the extensive prevalence of pecuuar notions 
with regard to the meaning and application of tbe 
old testament and esjecially of the decalogue is 
such as to excite a strong feeling of offence at 
whatever tisnds to throw discredit on their literal 
authority 

to those whose views are such as to amalgamate 
together all the different parts of the bible into one 
and who do not recognize the distinctions between 
the different portions of the divine revelations a 
difficulty found in one part will assume the character 
of an objection to all other parts and serionslj 
endanger the stability of the whole and to those 
who have been led habitually to comlnne togetlier

new whatever is found to preclude the literal accep 
tation of passages in the books of moses and in

til contradictions directly affecting the passages 
containing the account of the seven days whether 
in genesis or £xodus doubtless oppose fatal objec 
tions to the opinions of those who imagine the insti 
tution of the sabbath to apply to christians to 
thoso who recognise in xenesis the supposed pri 
mietal institution of that observance the rejection 
of the histaiical character of the jassage of course 
destroys the main argument on which their opinion 
is built and to those who adopt the obligations of 
the judaical decalogue the difficulties must appear 
especially formidable and little less than subversive 
of religion 

on the other hand patient attention to the mani 
fest distinctions between the several different divine 
dispensations whether to the jews or the patriarchs 
recorded in the collected volume of the scriptures 
will exhibit in the characteristics of christianity a 
total independence of those passages whether in 
exodus or genesis which are involved in physical 
contradictions 

let the candid inquirer then search the records 
of the new testament for the simple doctrines of 
jesus christ and his apostles and jierceiving the 
distinct and independent nature of that doctrine 
and assured of the immovable firmness of that rook 
of moral evidence on which its truth is built he will 
be able to afford unhesitatingly to confess and avow

dictions between tlie language adopted in the old 
testament and in the delivery of the jewish law 
and the existing evidences of the order of creation 
without any impeachment of the religion he pro 
fesses 

systematic theologians indeed of several schools 
not acknowledging the spiritual simplicity of chris 
tianity have too commonly distorted and disfigured 
its heavenly features by an incongruous admixture 
partly of human conceits partly of the peculiaritiei 
of the judaical or even perhaps earlier dispen 
sations 

but a more simple and direct inquiry into the 
religion of the new testament seems to me to lead 
with increasing clearness to the conviction that su 
views are but ierversions of its real spirit and 
from such perversion alone it is that christianitj 
can ever be exposed to datiger or its credit in the 
least affected by the circumstance that language at 
variance with wliat is now known for physical truths 
was employed in the delivery of their law to the 
jews or in recounting to them the records of an 
earlier age in passages on which nothing in the new 
and spiritual religion of the gospel is anywhere made 
to depend by its divine founder or his apostles 

when therefore we consider these contradictioni 
they appear but to add clearness to an enlightened 
view of christianity and we may ask avith increased 
confidence what have we to do iith these things f

in this section we have considered the contradictions 
which exist between the dramatic representations 
and poetical imagery of the bible and the pheno 
mena disclosed to geological research at far greater 
length than the real simplicity of the case would 
call for if men were disposed to view it in its real 
simplicity but when such a mass of prepossesdon 
opposes the admission of rational views of the 
matter we are necessitated to enter more at large 
on the principles iuvolyed in order to clear away the 
erroneous notions which have encumbered the whole 
subject

proper order and chain f evidence connecting the

general conclusion 



throughout tbo rhoie of the foregoing discussion 
in illustrating the mutual relation and reaction 
between pliysical science natural theology and 
revealed religion we have referred much to the 
various misapprehensions which prevail respecting 
such connexion among the several branches of the 
inquiry we have referred especially to the fears 
entertained for the safety of religion and the expe 
dients resorted to for obviating the supposed danger 
—expedients as futile as the alarms are groundless 
we have commented on the hostility felt against 
science and the dread of free inquiry the disparage 
ment of natural theology and of physical inquiry as 
its basis which are dictated by the adherence to the 
narrowest and most unworthy views of the tenour of 
revelation while the rejection of the physical 
evidences of creation on the one hand and the 
attempts to accommodate the hebrew scriptures to 
them on the other display an unhappy perplexity of 
ideas whether as to the principles of interpretation 
or to the character and objects of the different parts 
of the sacred writings 

we have adverted to the causes which have led to 
the adoption of these views if we look to the cofutf

general gonclusioit 



 



quences of encouraging guch a spirit it is evident 
that its ineiitable results trill bo anything but so 
viceable to the true interests of christianitj the 
followers of these systems may persuade themseltes 
they are powerfully upholding religion whilst in 
reality they are only thus exposing themseltes and 
their cause to increased suspicion among its avowed 
enemies and with many who are desirous to be ita 
friends 

such narrow views and flimsy speculations insisted 
on as necessary to the support of the christian reli 
gion can only tend to throw discredit on its evi 
dences or be regarded as betraying a secret mis 
giving as to their soundness in the minds of its 
professed disciples 

if such a spirit increase and gain ground among 
the friends of religion and continue to be inculcated 
and urged by its advocates it is manifest that in the 
temper of the present times whether by one course 
or another it must equally lead to the very object 
they are so anxious to strive against the wider and 
deeper eaiension ofirrdigum 

attempts to oppose rational inquiry and free dis 
cussion have always been as vain and fritile in them 
selves as iemicious to real christianity whenever 
they have partially succeeded it has only been on the 
one hand in producing general hypocrisy ill conceal 
ing irreligious licentiousness or on the other in 
setting faith and philosophy in open hostility and 
thus science from being in its proper way the

powerful auxiliary has been converted into the 
enemy of religion only by the illjudged zeal of its 
friends by a perversion of christianity they alienate 
from it those who would be its best and most 
enlightened supporters and professedly setting them 
 selves in array against knowledge they appear to 
make open confession that religion must be esta 
blished on the basis of ignorance and as far as they 
can force it into an unnatural alliance with darkness 
rather than light 

such inquiries as those we have here been endea 
vouring to elucidate point to a widely extended 
connexion and dependence subsisting between the 
truths of natural and revealed theology between 
the manifestations of the divinity in the natural and 
moral creation in the order and design of the phy 
sical world and in those spiritual revelations of the 
most elevated kind which we find in scripture 
between the two books in which as bacon has 
observed divine communications are alike vouch 
safed to us the volume of nature and the page of 
inspiration the points of analogy between the two 
departments of inquiry are indeed peculiarly striking 
and most worthy to bo more diligently studied and 
practically applied than they seem to have been 
the discussion of them would form the appropriate 
sequel to the foregoing essay and such a sequel i 
have immediately in contemplation

general oonclusioir 



 



for the present i will doee with a verj brief 
recapitulation 

it has been our object to show that the order and 
dependence of fixed law and general prindples 
constitutes our notion of physical cause and eflfect 
and it is from the arrangnent and stuimetrj of 
these principles or causes that we ascend to the 
great source of order andhannony from the facta 
of physical causation to the infinite marai cause 
ordaining and animating the entire system of them 

physical science is the necessary foundation of 
natural theology certain of the truths it disdosea 
are warnings against mistaking the purport of 
scripture and the right use of the caution thua 
inculcated applies widely in the interpretation of 
rotclation inductive philosophy is subservient both 
to natural and revealed religion the investigation 
of gods works is an essential introduction to the 
right reception of his word 

the conclusions of natural theology are limited in 
extent but demonstrative in proof they are most 
important in themselves and indispensable in the 
foundations of any evidence of revelation ita 
truths elevate science into fiuth while its deficiencies 
evince the necessity for further illuminlition it 
tends to inculcate humility and to excite inquiry 
and where it shows the path of reason to be dosed 
it points to the brighter opening of inqnration

to the logical reader the object of the whole discussioq in 
this section may be expkuncd in a word induction in its 
physical sense is the process of collecting the ecidenee for 
the truth of the premisa of the syllogism into which logic 
analyzes the reasoning our present question refers more 
especially to that which is at once the most diflscult and 
important part the evidence for the mcjar — see akcb 
bisiiop what£ly ijogicj pp and 

the mistake of some writers in supposing that in the 
enthymematic form the suppressed premiss is the mimor 
seems to me not improbably traced to the view they appear 
to adopt that the perfect case of induction would be that 
in which etery individual was examined the less accurate 
when only a few yet as we have observed above the last 
are the only cases in which any reasofiing takes place 

logic being nothing else than the theory of concitmtoa 
ness includes in its analysis the reasoning which takes place 
in induction as well as in all other cases it is from a total 
misconception therefore that the dialectic and inductive 
are often represented as two rival methods on the one hand 
or expected to be auxiliaries on the other 

it may perhaps be necessary here to remark that the 
word analogy which so frequently occurs in this discus 
sion is invariably used by me in the simple sense of a

paralielism or correspondence between two sett of things 
or events which may have no nmiiariiy or resemblance 
whatever analogy is a similarity of relation merely not 
of qualities those readers to whom the distinction may 
not be familiar are referred for a full and luminous expo 
sition of the whole case to the notes on bishop coplesroms 
inquiry into the doctrines of necessity bcf p or 
to archbishop whatelys logic p 

the reader will find an excellent brief summary of the 
nature of induction in the introduction to da hampdens 
bampton lectures p 

the view here taken of induction and phyncal analogy 
is admirably illustrated in the following masterly passage 
of laplace—

with regard to the importance of analogical conddera

we shall perhaps be reminded as has been often said 
that the most important philosophical discoveries have been 
made by chance it was however the observatioq ct

requires to be peculiarly impressed oo them namely to 
acquaint themselves in some moderate dqree with the 
general nature of the subject lefore tbej adduce detached 
points of objection as fatal to the whole train of conclusions 

to take however an instance of the kind of objection 
alluded to one geologist dwells oo the uncertainty attend 
ing a positive distinction of particular formations from their 
mineral characters alone and inasts oo the attainment of 
certainty only from their characteristic fossil remains 
another remarks that in some particular cases conrider 
able ambiguity attaches to the determination of fossil 
remains and that those really bdonging to different forma 
tions may in some instances be confounded together 
hence the objector contends that the argument halts oo 
both its legs and triumphs in his inference that there can 
be no certainty at all in the science in other words 
because either source of evidence alone may be defective 
therefore both together cannot be satisfactory or again 
because in some instances there may be confessed ambigui 
ties in the interpretation therefore in no case can there 
be any certainty a passage is sometimes cited from 
cuviers account of his researches on fossq bones in which 
he with all the caution of a true philosopher carefully 
insists on all the sources of fallacy by which his inquiries 
were liable to be affsccted and speaks with becoming 
modesty of his conclusions as often being far removed 
from the evidence of demonstration and this u then con 
strued by the sceptic into a confession that the whole science 
has no solid foundation and is little more than a system of 
gratuitous hypotheses 

it would be useless to dwell further on such speculatioos 
i should not perhaps have noticed them at all had they 
not recently received a certain stamp of respectability from 
their association with the name of a writer of old repute

loed brougham in his discourse on natural theologf in 
a note on cause and effect after stating the nature and 
upholding the soundness as far as it goes of humes doo 
trine of causation yet contends that something more is 
necessary to a complete view of the subject besides the 
notion of invariable sequence he maintains we have also a 
 belief that the one event occasions the other that there 
is between the two a connexion beyond the mere rdation of 
junction and sequence and that the pveceding event exerts 
an influence a force a power over the other and producea 
the otber— p 

and the grounds of this belief he oootends are to be 
found in the proofs st of the invariable sequence shid 
of the condition that not only must the second event 
always have been found to follow the first bat the second 
must never have been observed without the first preceding 
it or at least without some other preceding it in wuch case 
the causation is predicated alike of both these preceding 
events — p si 

or in fewer words we must prove thai one event

always follows the other and tliat it ceases when the other 
ceases but besides this d our minds form whether 
we will or no another idea not merely that of constant con 
nexion or succession but of the one exerting a power over 
the other by an inherent force and this is the idea of cau 
sation whence do we derive it i apprehend only from 
our consciousness we feel that we have a will and a 
power ice 

he then traces the effects originating in our volition 
which we can produce on material objects around us and 
contends that we hence form our notion of causation as 
above defined that we do thus obtain an idea of causa 
tion is i conceive perfectly unquestionable but it refers 
solely to one speciea viz that which by our voluntaiy 
agency produces effects on matter subject to us or what i 
have termed moral causation the author does not pursue 
this point any further so as to show how or whether at all 
the notion applies to physical causes and effects this is 
what i have attempted to do above we transfer the idea 
by a fair analogy to other cases of animal power and to 
instances in which we trace the marks of intelligence but 
only by a vague imaginary and deludve one to the suc 
cession of physical events or their dependence one oo 
another 

the author proceeds to discuss the idea of necessary 
connexion which m the sense of i priori necessity is 
certainly excluded by this view of causes since the 
whole is a question of fad of contingent truth but be 
maintains that our ideas of power and of causation are 
solid and wellfounded although they only refer to a power 
or a causation which may or may not exist in this i 
entirdy concur especially when viewed in connexion 
the distinctions here laid down

tus achromatism of the eye is m subject which has 
sioned much discussion and that of a remarkable kind 
the most eminent optical writers have been directly opposed 
in opinion as to the fact and those who have admitted 
tlieac have yet held it unaccountable and have sought 
indirect explanations of it as being strictly speaking 
impassible in theory 

i have as i believe for the first time shown that it is 
perfectly passible in theory whilst it may or may not be 
the fact in different individual cases i mention this the

the extreme confusion which has been introduced into dis 
cussions of this nature owing to the ambiguity of the term 
 cause has been ably exposed by several writers the 
same point has been dwelt upon by mr irons on final 
causes p who has examined largely the various ops 
nions of ancient and modem writers on the subject and has 
discussed the views of hume and others with regard to the 
nature of causation with so extensive a knowledge of 
philosophical authors to judge from his quotations it 
seems strange that he has omitted all refereiioe to the 



iiuiitiimiimtuikiit itiiirii iisrairliiiitfian 



 notes 

physical part of the subject and has not been led to the 
distinction on which i have so particularly dwelt between the 
physical and the moral senses of the term cause he 
has in fact confined himself throughout to the idea of an 
operative agency or what i have called moral causation 
and considers all idea of causation as including that of an 
efficient influence defining a cause to be that which of 
itself makes any thing begin to be pp usd 
which is in fact intelligence 

proceeding then on such an idea of causes and omitting 
all reference to the great argumentfrom physical causes in 
the sense in which i have explained them it is not sur 
prising that this author should disparage to the uttermost 
the argument from final causes of which he takes so un 
happily contracted a view he has however clearly dis 
tinguished the boundary between our knowledge of the bare 
fact of fitness or adjustment in created beings and their 
properties and the inference of design and intelligence 
the former he shows was the strict sense in which alone 
the ancient philosophers spoke of final causes among 
other points he particularly refers p to a circum 
stance related by mr campbell the missionary that on 
showing a watch to some savages they were by no means 
able to infer design this example has in fact been much 
dwelt upon and regarded as decisive against the efficiency 
of paleys argument but i would ask were the savages 
able to reason in any other case or to make inferences at 
all this must obviously be shown before the case can be 
of the slightest avail to the argument paley i apprehend 
never contemplated the reasoning as addressed to savages

omnipotent gravitation — what is the origin of that i 
answer this too we know full well the daughter of the 
old blind fate — her servants magnitude number and pro 
portion — her inheritance a universe without a god which 
requires no god when the great astronomer lalande 
denied a deity could trace in the heavens no god in the 
movement of the stars no finger of god we are oompdkd 
to allow the logical consequence of his reasoning that 
high order and adaptation of end and means is only the pro 
duct of the rigid mechanism of necessary physical laws 
tliere above is only a blind mindless destiny the absolute 
ruler of its universe but i appeal to the truth of the 
saying in st johnin the spirit only shall we worship god 
and in what only our science is for mind is its dignity and 
value to be found he only can style the order of the 
universe an adaptation of means to end who brings to its 
observation a belief in the reality of design but the true 
interpretation of the order of design lies far more deariy 
apparent in the mind of man the infinite spirit does not 
bail itself under proportion and number the puy with

object of which is to prove that the highest mathematical 
or physical talent does not confer nay even impairs the 
power of reasoning on other subjects of this the passage 
quoted certainly supplies a remarkably strong instance 
though not i believe contemplated in that light by the 
reviewer if the author be really entitled to the mathematical 
reputation which he is said to bear in grermany 

this mass of confusion of ideas would be at once cleared 
away by a slight attention to those distinctions which i have 
endeavoured to indicate 

it appears to me that the attempt to dene the term 
 blind fate or necessity would at once decide all 
questions of this sort i can attach no meaning to it which 
is not at once contradictory to the notion of design blind 
fate could not produce adaptation to an end if it ooum it 
would no longer be blind fate but eternal providence 

we may take for another example the remark of an 
extremely wellintentioned writer— 

 it is manifest that the mineral geology considered as a 
science can do as well without god though on a questioii 
concerning the origin of the earth as lucretius did— 
pekn comparative ehimate r 

if geology proceeded by any other course than that of the 
independent study of minerals it would neither be a 
science nor could it afford the slightest proof of a deity 
it investigates a question concerning the origin of the 
earth j without making any aeeumpium of a creator and 
that investigation leads to the most decisive proof of a 
creator which would be no proof but an argument in a 
circle if it had aeeumed a creator in the first instance it 
is sufficient to add with rard to lucretius that to bin 
those proofs were whouy unknown 

i wiu cite one more passage in further illustration —

dr turton has in another place ably explained the

in the manifest design he all along entertained and so 
successfully pursued of putting the whole argument in a 
perfectly popular form so as to place it within the grasp of 
the most limited or least cultivated understanding this 
ooottderation appears to me to afford at once a perfectly 
satisfactory vindication of paley if he had not entered into 
the details of the question but i cannot help thinking 
that in this as in some other instances the regius pro 
fessor has been somewhat too severe on the noble author 
the fact certainly does appear to me upon the most careful 
review of the passages adduced to be much in favour of 
the justice of lord broughams complaint of the omission 
of an exacts philosophical discussion of the point in ques 
tion that the omission was designed and wisely designed 
in reference to paleys particular object does not affect the 
question of its being an omission when considered in a 
strictly metaphysical light the precise point of the infer 
ence of mind is rather asserted than proved rather illusiraied 
than rigidly anatymcd it is a subject worthy of nnore 
profonnd investigation than i have happened to find bestowed 
upon it so far as the doctrine of causatum is concerned 
i may venture to hope that the illustrations conveyed in

manifestly attach to it in the eyes of any one who had read

tended much to keep up the prejudices which for a long

the generality of men cling to the authority of a distinguished

perhaps the surrender of established ideas to such sources

parts void of understanding than if it were necessary that 
ever and anon a discreet servant should be employed to 
concur notably to the operations of this or that part or to 
hinder the engine from being out of order so it more sets 
off the wisdom of grod in the fabric of the universe that he 
can make so vast a machine perform all those many things 
which he designed it should by the mere contrivance of

interpobition it requires the perfection of every jneoe of 
workmanship human and divine consists in its answering 
the designed purpose without bestowing further labour

that an opposite feeling should prevail in a poet is not 
surprising and we trace it in the dunciad canto iv l 
but it is angular that views so rational and satisfactoty 
should have been objected to bj m phihiopher like dugam 
stewart who condemns them in no measured terms as 
 absurd c and this upon the idea that it would be unworthy 
of the deity to employ a machinery of second causes becaue 
machinery among men is avowedly introduced to save labour 
and accomplish the purpose in view moie easily and com 
pletdy which of course cannot apply to the designs of 
omnipotence— patosopay of mind il but the real 
question obviously refers to the machinery not for the work 
it does but for the kill displayed in its construction and 
operation the proofs of which are unquestionably str o n ger 
as it requires less manual interferenoe 

the following passage from one of the most eminent of 
newtons followers u worthy of careful consideration 
 as we cannot but conceive the universe as depending on 
the first cause and chief mover whom it would be abrard 
not to say impious to exclude from acting in it so we have 
some hints of the manner in which he operates in nature 
from the laws which we find established in it though he 
b the source of all efficacy yet we find that place is left for 
second catues to act in subordination to him and mechanism 
has its share in carrying on the first scheme of nature the 
establishing the equality of action and reaction even in those 
powers which seem to surpass mechanism and to be more 
immediately derived from him seems to be an itwiv tvm

in support of these and the like views the writings of poets 
are frequently appealed to and with good reason as such 
ideas are properly congenial to the region of poetry — the 
error lies in mistaking them for philosophy thus a weq 
known and justly admired passage of cowper tvmip 
book y l is often cited in confirmation of the opinioo 
above adverted to if thus applied it involves the fallacy 
in reasoning here exposed the writings of that amiahlft

of physical science a subject on which it must be manifrst

thx following incident involving the opinions of two 
eminent scholars is given by the learned author of the 
parriana — i had once the pleasure of driving the doctor 
parr a few miles into the country to visit a former pupfl 
when we returned together it was a bright starlight nigiht 
and the beauty of the scene over our heads led me to ask 
him with reference to the mosaic record how long in his 
opinion those orbs had rolled and glittered he made some 
remarks on the term created employed by the sacred 
penman distinguishing between creation strictly understood 
and formatioo or putting the then chaos into its present 
order i did not then admire the distinction which throws 
back the creation to an indefinite period and thrusts the 
creator from what seems his proper place and if moaea 
should fail us here and the same mode of criticism be 
adopted in other parts of scripture i fear we shall have no 
proof of the creation of a maunriiu world at least 

i am not quite aware to what date this anecdote bdongs

as by far the dearest shortest and most explidt statement 
of the most recent bibliahgeokgical views referred to whidi 
i have seen i will mention an article in the magaasine of 
popular science no january issf bearing the 
signature of j p s which i believe are the initials of an 
eminent and learned dissenting divine i refer particularly 
to this paper as coocdving it may possess considerable 
weight with many persons while the tone and sprit in 
whidi it is written is such as will secure it an impartial 
perusal from all parties 

the question respecting the description of the creation ia 
brought into the shortest compass by looking at the predae 
statement whidi the author gives of his own views he 
concdves 

st that the beginning means an indefinitdy long 
period during which the successive formations recognised bj 
geology may have taken place 

sdly that at a recent epoch our planet was brought 
into a state of disorganization detritus or ruin perhi 
we have no perfecuy appropriate term from a former 
conditkm 






 notes 

sdlj that out of this condition the existing creation 
took place literally as described in six natural days 

the author has also expressed his positive conviction that 
any real contradiction of the scripture account by geological 
phenomena must at once involve the refection of the truth 
of the whole bible but he contends that the above inter 
pretation removes all discrepancy and thus secures us from 
the consequences otherwise fatal to rdigion 

he does not appear to be aware that the second of the 
positions above assumed is precisely that which is absolutdy 
contradicted by all geological evidence 



great weight has been attributed to certain 
remarks by dr pusey regius professor of hebrew 
inserted as a note in dr bucklands bridgewater treaiiee 
vol l p on the interpretation of those expressions in 
the st chapter of genesis which bear most upon the 
biblicogeological views 

while i most readily acknowledge the critical value of 
remarks coming from so eminent an authority in hebrew 
literature i cannot perceive that anything substantial is 
gained by them in support of the geological version of the 
passage or in other words the hypothesis that moses was 
inspired to teach geology either to the isradites or to us 

it appears in the first place from dr puseys statements 
that the original word rendered created does not neces 
sarily imply the idea of an actual calling into existence out 
of nothing this indeed does away with the commonly 
received scripture proof of that prevalent opinion but bears 
very little upon any geological diiuculty

dr puaey to be justified od critical grounds and m 
hiitocy of the existing creation conttdered to beg with the 
third verse 

this as i have already observed appears to me still to 
leave the main contradiction untoudied however the 
learned author considers thb question of punctuation to be 
important and confirms it by an appeal to the opinions of 
old writers and to the mode of division adopted in some 
early translation of the bible he adds — this then is just 
the sort of confirmation which one wished for because though 
•one would shrink from the impiety of bending the language of 
gods book to any other than its obvious meaning we can 
not help fearing lest we might be unconsciously influenced 
by the floating opinions of our own day and therefore turn 
the more anxiously to those who explained holy scripture 
before those theories existed you must allow me to add 
that i would not define further we know nothing of 
creation nothing of ultimate caue nothing of spaoe 
except what is bounded by actual existing bodies nothing

of which they were altogether necessarily ignorant nor 
again am i able distinctly to understand in what manner the 
latter clause of the paragraph bears upon the question i 
entirely agree with the author in his remarks on our ideas of 
ultimate causes space and time but i know not to what 
dogmatizing he alludes on these points in any geological 
speculations even the biblegeologists in their theory of 
the days understood as ages surely do not dogmatize on 
any notions of time or qpace still less do rational geok 
gists refer to any metaphysical distinctions of the kind 
they merely affirm the succession in order of time of 
deposits which are arranged one on another and of the 
respective races of animals entombed in them the quota 
tion adduced at the end seems to me to refer rather to thecv 
logical than to physical subjects and to put a check on 
inquiries directed not to the structure of the earth but to 
the mysteries of heaven

od rdigious grounds he lia in fact in the fint imtance 
taken the very same genenl tenoor of obsenration as that 
of the present discussion lefierring in particukr to the 
strong and unanswerable aigament of the absence of all 
indications which must hate been left of any universal 
chaos in a oomparativdj recent period followed by a simul 
taneous creation he has adduced the unquestionable bctm 
of the coexistence of recent with extinct species in the later 
tertiary formations and has put in the most pointed man 
ner the irresistible concluaon that the supposed last great 
change neither preceded nor was coeval with the formatioq 
of the newer pliocene nor could it possibly have succeeded 
that formation p he avowedly passes by the 
question how any universal inguigitation of the land could 
be brought to pass and hints at the utter impossibilitiea 
which are involved in any hypothesis of this kind 

in supporting these plain inferences from cmis he has 
given the valuable testimony of a professed and strenuous 
advocate of rdigion to the necessity of ixmestly rejecting 
all those temporizing expedients and unworthy suppressions 
or disguisings of the truth which have been so commonly 
practised 

in attempting to supply the deficiencies as he thus con 
siders them of the theory of a recent universal change cor 
responding to the mosaic creation he is not equally happy 
nor very consistent with the vpint of his previous remarka 
he adopts in general the notion of the days meaning 
indefinite periods but in the particular details seems to me 
not more felicitous nor satisfactory than any of his prede 
cessors in the vain and revolting attempt to lower and 
destroy the majestic imagery of the sublimest compositioii 
in the world and by the introduction of a literalinng 
interpretation to torture the whole representation into m 
e which it never could have been intended to bear

om the question of geology and scripture the reader will 
find some interesting remarks in an article on the recent 
progress of geology be by dr t thomson inserted in 
dr r thomsons british annual far 

observations on such a subject coming from a writer so 
preeminently distinguished in chemistry and the kindred 
sciences will be duly valued and of the general ezcd 
lence of their scope and tenour i willingly express my con 
viction did they come from a less eminent authority i 
would not stop to notice what strikes me as defective in soma 
parts of the reasoning but in the present instance my 
desire to see such a subject treated solely on the unawailsblt 
grounds of truth must be my excuse for alluding to one or 
two points which seem to me open to objection 

at the commencement of the concluding portion of hb 
article p the author says 

 it has been a£brmed by some wrongheaded cur fanatical 
individuals that the facts disclosed by geology are incon 
sutent with the mosaic account of the creation and on 
that account attempts have been made to discourage the 
cultivation of geology tic 

here i must confess either i do not apprehend the mean 
ing or else the author must be including himsdf under his 
own censure since the views he has just before been btoadi 
ing evince most indihitably those very contradiotioiis 
which he here describes as affirmed by some wrongheaded 
or fanatical individuala 

however he next makes some exodlent observations on 
the objects of revelation as totally distinct from those of 
science in whidi i most fully concur but in asubseqoent

the remainder of the authors observations consist in

he argues are cases of qpecial intervention on this point

diiciitsion of the theological difllcultiei and in fact ailfiilly 
eludes all such questions by appealing in forcible terms to 
the existing satisfaction of public opinion in soodand en 
these points as resting on interpretations now uniteraally 
received and then going off into an eloquent view of the 
general scope and design of revdation as distinct finom 
scientific objects he there leaves the matter yet in die 
representation thus nwde slight and general as it is there 
seems to me much of interest and demanding notice in oon 
nexion with the object of the present work 

after a luminous historical sketdi of the pi o grcsa of 
geological views the controversies whidi prevailed die 
hostility once excited among the scottish clergy against the 
new science and the gradual cessation of that opposttioo 
the present situation of affairs is thus described p — 
 after having for half a century stumbled on the dark 
mountains the church is now feeding her flock on the 
green pastures of the huttonian geology she recognises 
as an impregnable truth the great principle tat whidi 
hutton and playfair were proscribed and has commanded 
the sacred scholar to accommodate his philology to the 
huttonian interpretation of the language of moses now 
not to dwell upon the somewhat singular kind of spritual 
pasture here assigned to the christian flock i oonfiess i 
neither understand liow the church succeeds in enforcing 
this command on the sacred scholar nor what sort of 
 philology can effect the accommodation required ihave 
before adverted to the various philological attemptsp which 
are all manifest failures not only in principle but even in 
their critical details i have also pointed out the actual 
force of the contradictions and at the same time as appears 
to me the entire independence of christianity with reqied 
to them to apply such considerations it would seem must 
involve peculiar difficulty in the case of a church whoae 



 notes 

formularies i bdiere are grounded upon a very express 
adoption of the obligations of the old testament dispen 
sation and especially of the sabbath in accordance with 
the dogmas of the westminster assembly notwithstand 
ogf l ome means it seems so completely has this accom 
modation been brought about to the satisfaction at least of 
all inquirers in scodand that the reviewer says of dr 
bucklands chapter on the subject — to us in scotland it 
seemed a work of supererogation the question had been 
 discussed to exhaustion during the scottish controversy 
between the rival theories even the pious professor of 
divinity in our university had adopted the explanatioa 
given by the huttonians and the public mind was equally 
tranquillixed — p 

the precise nature of the explanation given by the 
huttonians and adopted by the professor of divinity does 
not appear however that the public mind should have 
been tranquillized on the subject is not surprising the 
great mass of nominal believers doubtless looked on the 
disclosures of geology with consternation and horror as long 
as they were told that its doctrines were subversive of religioci 
by those who ought to know the professor of divinity 
had but to ailopt the huttonian explanation and the 
church to enjoin on its ministers the use of a correspoodinff 
pliilology and the public thus enlightened immediatdy 
ceased from their outcries either against geology or ao 
support of the truth of religion and relapsed into their 
ordinary utter indiiterence to both 

the reviewer however continues in a subsequent pas 
sage — the question indeed lies within a narrow com 
pass the truths of religion and science can never be at 
variance a geological truth must command our assent as 
powerfully as that of the existence of our own mindsi or of 
the deity himsdf and any revelatioii whidi stands oppoaed

to such truths must be false the geologist has theiefore 
nothing to do with revealed religion in his scientific inquiriea 
it is the office of the divine to interpret the sacred canod 
and if he does this with the discrimination and learning it 
demands he will never find it at variance with the deductioiis 
of science if scripture on the contrary be studied bjr 
instalments and viewed from insulated points and interpreted 
literally in its detached passages we shall find it at variance 
with itself and shall reproduce all the heresies which have 
disgraced the history of the christian church but if we 
look at the sacred scheme as a whole and genoaliie its 
individual proportions we shall find in it a unity of do 
trine be 

in the general excellence of these remarks i fully aoqineaoe 
the observation in the first sentence is undeniable — truth 
cannot be contrary to itself would merely notice that this 
seems a singular reason why the geologist should therejar 
have nothing to do with revealed truth in his researches 
that he lias not is very true not for this reason but on 
account of the essential independence of scientific inquiry 
into the works of god as i have before explained 

but further it is worthy of notice with how much skill 
the precise point of the contradiction is eluded under the 
eloquent and undeniable generalities by which the respon 
sibility is shifted on to the shoulders of the divine his 
business it is to interpret scripture which when rightly 
understood will never be found at variance with geology 
— and why because when comprehensively studied it 
furnishes a unity of doctrine a spiritual law be all 
which great objects of revelation the writer proceeds to dilate 
upon in the powerful language of just encomium through 
the remainder of the paragraph 

in a general sense nothing can be more just than the 
remarks here made on the principles of scripture interprs

utiod yet this appears to me not a little at tarianoe with 
the literal philology before recommended 

in a more particular sense however i cannot but regard 
the indiscriminate adoption of this generalizing system 
by which all the different parts of the sacred records are 
amalgamated into one and the distinction of their separate 
applications lost siglit of as the very source of the difficulty 
and objection felt on the ground of the geological discre 
panciesb 

there is no doubt a plausibility in the vague assertion 
that geological conclusions cannot really come into couifion 
with religious truths — but the facts show that in the present 
instance there u such a collision — since the literal history 
of the creation involves the prinueval institution of the 
sabbath a collision which no philology can prevent no 
generalities disguise — but it can become an cbjection only 
from the prevalence of that system which mixes up chris 
tianity with older dispensations

of oeganizeo life ako its mileoself 

successiox 



ik gorroboratiou of my remarks oo the unbroken series of 
changes by which the existing order of things on the globe 
has been introduced i have peculiar satisfaction in being 
permitted to present my readers with the followiug extract 
from a letter with which i have been favoured by peofessoe 
phillips of king college london— 

 the origin of organic life upon the globe it may 
perhsps be impossible for geologists to fix either with 
reference to the successive times disclosed by the examinatioq 
of the earths crust or the geographical poritian but it is 
certain that in descending the series of strata i e in 
ascending the stream of time we arrive at epochs continually 
less and less fertile of animal life and finally readi a ter 
minus of this life as judged of by the organic remains in 
the rocks before attaining the limit of gedogical time 
estimated in terms of the thickness and nature of stratified 
deposits this is the true geological definition of the origin 
of organic kfe on the globe 

 if it should be asked as is natural were there any 
previous systems of life oo the globe i reply this is a 
matter to be considered on the evidence ccdkcted by geolo 
gists as to the physical conditions under which the 
strata of the globe were deposited in the primseval 
perhaps the balance of evidence including of course that 
derived from general physical ooosidenitioasi is in favoilr of 



 noteb 

the hypothesis that the globe was in a state unfavourable to 
the devdopment of organic life by reason of the greater 
influence then exercised by its proper heat upon the pheno 
mena at the surface than after a considerable thickness of 
nonconducting materials the earlier strata had become 
effectual in retarding the flow of heat from within at all 
events or u reasoning from facts observed the origin of 
tmr system of organic life is to be placed in the midst of 
the period of primary strata 

 the earliest forms of life known to geology are not as 
might perhaps be expected plants but animals they arc 
not of the lowest grade of wganization merely zoophyta 
far advanced in structure lamelliferous corals brachio 
podous bivalves of three genera were found by mysdf on 
snowdon but no distinct traces of plants thentfiiifier 
of species of this early fsuina is extremdy small but there 
is about them no mark of inferiority — no extraordinary 
simplicity 

 from this origin of organic life there is no break in the 
vast chain of organic development till we reach the existing 
order of things no one geological period long or short 
no one series of stratified rocks is everywhere devoid of 
traces of life the world once inhabited has apparently never 
for any ascertainable period been totally despoiled of its 
living wonders but there have been many changes in the 
individual forms great alterations in the generic assem 
blages entire revolutions in the relative number and deve 
lopment of the several classes thus the systems of life 
have been varied from time to time to suit the altered 
oonditiod of thefdanet but never extinguished the earth 
once freed from its early inadequacy to support life aooord 
ing to the afyointed laws of life has since been prolific of 
vcsetable and ft cxistcnoel 

 the jmifiorlibfiole sttier of organic forms has gone oil

even graduauy see my guide to geology mugmenting from 
the dozen species of the snowdon dates through the twelire 
hundred and more species of the oolite the four fhonnami 
forms of the tertiary eras to the multitudes of existing 
things the chafige of organic structure is ako in some 
diee proportioned to the time dapsed tried by the 
cephalopodous mollusca we see perish first the orthooeratitesy 
then the belemnites and ammonites while nautilus and 
sepia exbt to represent tliis class in existing nature the 
development of the different classes of animals is usually 
thought to exhibit a similar reutioo as if nature had been 
continually improved from the moment of the origin of ufe 
but this opinion is if taken generally one of the least certain 
of all the general notions now current because of a radical 
defect in the reasoning this defect consists in assuming 
into one induction the terrestrial and marine races of aninuds 
now as the higher forms of life are terrestrial and the 
remains of terrestrial things are only by accident mixed 
with the spoils of the sea it is no wonder that mammalia 
and birds are rarely suspected even to occur among the 
buried spoils of the ocean however the diddphis of 
stonesfield is enough to cast a doubt on this notion whidi 
should be more critically examined by a logical process it 
should be inquired what is the order of devdopment among 
the marine races on one hand and the terrestrial groups oq 
the other the latter are too few in a fossil stat to justify 
any dedsion the former supply certain evidence the 
order of development is zoophyta and brachiopodous coo 
chifera the same groups with the addition of plagimyooooa 
conchifera gasteropoda cephalopoda fishes die same with 
the addition of reptiles the same with one solitary didd 
phis the same without didelphis or any other quadruped 
the same with marine and terrestrial quadrupeds cxistinf

 l the present creation of life a continuadon of the 
previous ones — a term of the same long series of oommu 
nicated being — i answer yes but not as the offspring 
is a continuation of its parent the present crocodiles are 
not thus derived from the teleosaurus of caen by indefinite 
change through time and circumstance as st hilaires and 
lamarcks and goethes speculations might lead to 
suppose but the existing forms of life resemble those of 
times gone by because the general aspect of the physical 
conditions of the world has always been since the origin 
life on the globe decidedly analogous and they differ from 
them because the corelation of life and physical conditions 
is strict and necessary so that all the variations of these 
conditions are represented in the phases of organic structure 
while all their general agreements arc also represented by 
the conformity of the great principles of structure in the 
beings of every geological age and the often repeated 
analogies and parallelisms of series of forms between diffe 
rent geological periods which we now hail as a law of 
nature when comparing america or australia with africa 
asia or europe 

 we are not then in a different system of nature pro 
perly so called from those which have been created and have 
been suffered to pass away before the birth of man but in a 
forward part of the same system whose law of progressioo 
is fixed though from time to time the signification of the 
terms varies the full and complete system ol organic 
life now on the globe includes all the effects of land and 
warmth and cold dinded regions and all the other 
which are the diversifying causes of nature and it is no 
wonder if before tliis land was raised from the deep and the 
present distinction of natural regions was produced then 
was not the same extreme variety ot natural produccionsb 
till that variety waa occasioped on the globe it was not tha

raises him above all that his senses make known and thus 
to fit him for the highest contemplatioo of which he is
