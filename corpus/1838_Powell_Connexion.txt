LORD BISHOP OF NORWICH. 



My dsab LobDi 

In availing myself of your Lordship^s pennission to 
dedicate to you the ensuing volumei I am denrons briefly 
to refer to the grounds on which I made the request, more 
especially because I feel assured that it is in the very same 
spirit ihat that request has been complied with. 

The right use and just value of physical science in con- 
nexion with the evidences and illustration of religious 
truth, are topics always demanding serious attention, but 
more especially in an age like the present, abounding with 
false pretensions on the one hand, and opposing prejudices 
on the other. Amid such errors and perversions it is 
a matter of particular satisfaction when the advocates of 
reason and truth find their efforts approved and encouraged 
by those whose situation in the Church silences all cavils ; 
and in no instance b this more gratifying than when those 
who are now in the poation to confer that sanction have 
themselves previously been labourers in the diffurion and 

enlargement of the knowledge of nature.

DEDICATION. 



Your Lordship^s sontimcnts on this important subject 
hare been sufficiently evinced, were it only by the part you 
have taken in ihat vast Association of British Science which 
is now yearly exciting so general and powerful an interest 
in physical pursuits, and by the xeal with which you liave 
there upheld the religious application of true philosophy, 
— and asserted the revelation of Ood in the volume of 
nature as our best guide to the manifestation of Him in the 
pages of inspiration. 

It was from such considerations, that, being engaged in a 
work having the same great object in view, I vras naturally 
led to look to your Lordship'^s name as ihat which above all 
others would be most appropriately prefixed to it, and most 
powerftdly assist in promoting the important end to which 
it is demgned to be subservient. 

I remain. 
With the greatest esteem and respect. 
My dear Lord, 

Most sincerely your^

PREFACE- 



Within a few years past, an exti*aordiiiaiy interest 
lias been evinced, and an unusual supply of iroiks 
produced on subjects relating to the application of 
Physical Science to Natural Theology ; its connexion 
with revelation, and the influence which physical 
truths have in guiding us even in the interpretation 
of Scripture. The tndn of writers called tonth by 
the Bridge water bequest ; the reproduction of Prey's 
work, illustrated and prefaced from the resources of 
a period of advanced knowledge ; and the various 
other publications to which these directly or indi- 
rectly have given rise, have together furnished a 
body of facts and arguments in which it might be 
supposed every topic would have been exhausted, 
and nothing left to be desired in the analyris of 
those evidences on which the fundamental truths of 
all religion are established. If we look more 
closely into the nature of the discussion, we howoTer 
perceive that this is far from being the case. With 
the majority of writers on natural theology, the 
mere accumulation of particular instance$ of design 
from different parts of the natural world, has been 
almost the sole object of attention ; now though it 
cannot be denied that they have thus most advan- 
tageously brought the resources of all branches of 
science to bear on the question, yet (to whatever 
source it may be traced), a great deficiency appears 
to exist to the exact tmafysii afprincg/hi, and the 
philosophy of the argument ; of which it must be

confessed we meet with frequent instances even 
among writers of high eminence. The cultivators 
of physical science, perhaps, have not been gene- 
rally disposed or qualified to enter upon logical dis* 
tinctions ; while the theological and metaphysical 
inquirers have too commonly been but little versed 
in physical evidence, and have thus failed to appre* 
ciate and enforce the extent and importance of the 
great argument from the order and arrangement of 
physical lan's and causes. 

To bring united resources of both kinds to bear 
on the subject has been the professed object of some 
of the recent publications alluded to. Among these 
the Bridgewater Treatise of Mr. Whewell, the Dis* 
course of Lord Brougham, and the Fragment of 
Mr. Babbage, stand conspicuous, especially when 
the first is taken in connexion with some passages 
in the Histo)y of the Inductive Sciences by the same 
author ; and the second, with the Natmnd TJieology 
of Dr. Turton. 

Another Avriter, also^ has recently discussed the 
evidences of natural theology ; but with widely dif- 
ferent views from any of those just referred to ; and 
to whose treatise (as it has obtained a considerable 
share of commendation in certain quarters,) I must 
briefly allude, viz., a work entitled. The whole Doe* 
trine of Final Causes, &c., by the Rev. W. J. Irons^ 
of Queen's College, Oxford. London, 1836. 

This writer, upon professedly philosophical prin^ 
ciples, and by an elaborate metaphysical argument, 
has undertaken to maintain that a strictly natural 
theology, logically deduced from the phenomena of 
creation, is absolutely unattainable..

Tliia position lie seeka to miuabua for the express 
object of showing the neccssitj and aU-sufficienqr 
of revelation. IIo pursues the argument bj enters 
ing largolf into the discussion of the nature of oatue$t 
examining the opinions, both ancient and modem, 
on the subject ; and after considering the nature of 
final causes, he at lengtli endeavours to show (upon 
his previous notion of causes in general,) that the 
aigument from final causes is altogether fallacioui 
and iUuBory. Hence he proceeds to contend for 
revelation as the only source of our kuonledge^ 
even of the ej.'istence of a Deity. A work of such 
pretensions, supported by at least the apjiearance of 
extenuve research and ciiidition, has natumlly de- 
manded attention. The greater part of these pages 
was written before I had seen Mr. Irons's publica> 
tion. However, some parts, as they then stood, I 
found related so closely to certain portions of that 
author's argument, that they were already sufficient 
to explain the grounds of my eutire dissent from 
him. In a few places, as they fell iu with the line 
of my observatious, I have since iutroduced some 
remarks which will be found to hear on other pomtB 
of his reasoniDg. 

I must here also odd a passing reference to 
Mr. Babbage'a « fragment," The Ninth Bridgewater 
Ti-eatue. To some of the philosophical views deve- 
loped and illustrated in it, I shall have oocasion to 
refer particularly in the course of the ensuing pages ; 
at present, I merely M-ish to express my conviction 
of its genei-al value, especially as suggesting riob 
matraials fbr thought, to every reader ci^ble of 
turning them to .account. I am tjie more Induced

Xll PREFACE. 

to offer this remark, because I am aware that the 
originality and novelty of the illustrations derived 
from an abstruse branch of science have not been 
generally appreciated ; and somewhat of singularity 
in the whole manner and appearance of the volume^ 
has tended, perhaps, to indispose some readers from 
doing justice to its real excellencies^ and even to 
doubt its tendency. 

To return to the general subject: Upon long con- 
tinued consideration, it has appeared to me that much 
was still wanting to its complete and satisfactory elu- 
cidation, and that several important points relative 
to the anafysis of the aigument and nature of the rea- 
soning, remained untouched, or very imperfectly ex- 
plained, even by those who have professedly entered 
more laigely upon a discussion of principles. If then 
the aigument has seemed to me to call for such 
further extension and explanation as in the ensuing 
pages it is mj endeavour to supply, it has been with 
the fullest appreciation of the numerous excellencies 
of the WTiters alluded to that I have engaged in the 
attempt to supply some of the deficiencies. On points 
where I feel obliged to differ from them, I have in 
genera] avoided specific controversy or criticism, and 
have usually stated my o^vn views and arguments 
simply as they arose out of the course of the main 
discussion, accomjianied by a reference which would 
sufficiently lead those readers who might be interested 
in it to Uie comparison of what I have advanced 
with the views^ more or less opposite^ of the writers 
referred to. 

My main object is to examine the coimexipn and 

the several great branches of the

inquiry ; — ^l>ctwecn physical science and natural theo- 
logy, as also between this and revealed religion; 
each in succession (iiniishiDg the necessary basis of 
evidence to the next ; and again, the indci)endence 
of each with respect to the succeeding, as essential 
to the order and force of the reasoning, whilst they 
yet maintain a close connection with, and reaction 
upon each other. 

Thus, from the very natm-e of the case it will be 
apparent to what extent the present publication can 
have any claims to novelty in its topics. Among the 
various ^Titers on kindred subjects I have met with 
none taking precisely the same line, or embracing 
exactly the same range of subject as that which is 
proposed to be pursued in the ensuing treatise. Yet 
almost every one of the different branches of my 
subject has been more or less discussed by some of 
the authors alluded to. In many cases my state- 
ments are, in fact, no more than an elementary 
exposition of a particular branch of the subject often 
treated before by others. Yet I conceive I have 
best consulted perspicuity and brevity in laying down 
the principles, as if delivering what was new to the 
reader, without fonnally referring him to authors 
who have treated of it before. 

It may perhaps be right to state, that a great part 
of the argument in the fourtli section runs nearly 
parallel with that of a discourse which I some time 
since published, intitled, Retdation oitd Science; 
Oxford, 1833. Also the introductory portion of the 
first section is a reprint (with a few alterations^) of 
a paper which I contributed to some early numbers 
of the Magazine of Pcptdar Science, vol. i. 1888.

In the details of examples adduced from different 
branclies of physical science, I have endeavoured, as 
fiur as possible, to avoid technicalities, or at least to 
explain the scientific terms referred to^ in the most 
popular form of illustration of which they appeared 
susceptible. Indeed throughout in the exposition of 
the argument, it has all along been made an object 
to elucidate the principles in the most perspicuous 
manner which the nature of the subject would 
admit, and to carry on the discussion in such a form 
as would be suitable to the general reader. 

One further remark must be added. In some of 
the late critical discussions on natural theology, 
great stress has been laid (as appears to me very 
mifairly,) on the omissions of certain writers. No 
author ought fiiirly to be subject to animadversion 
for not discussing what the peculiar line of argument 
he has selected does not lead him to discuss. I am 
therefore particulai'ly desirous of stating that the 
present work has no pretensions whatever to include 
a complete or systematic treatise on natural theology. 
Its outline embraces only certain particular questions 
connected with that science ; of a nature, indeed, 
preliminary and general in one part, and in another 
supplement ar}* and discursive; but in neither instance 
having any claim to be regarded as treating etery 
point belonging to the subject. In a word, I wish 
to bo judged of, not by what I do not say, but by 
what I do.

INTRODUCTION. 



The study of natural theology cannot be pursued 
alone, and disjoined from other branches of inquiij. 
It has a close connexion i^ith the study of phy- 
sical science on the one hand, and with that of 
revelation on the other. Whether we dwell upon 
the nature of the evidences, or upon the trutha 
established, this connexion is equally intimate. The 
stability of natural theology rests upon the demon- 
strations of physical truth : and upon the assurance 
of the great doctrines of natural theology must all 
proof, and even all notion, of a revelation be essen- 
tially founded. This intimate connexion and depen- 
dence, however, is by no means generally undorstoodt 
often questioned, and not unfrequently even dis- 
paraged and denied* 

In the discussion of the truths of natural theology 
much diflSculty has arisen in some minds, and mneh 
misapprehension of the whole nature of the aigo- 
ment The order and chain of proo^ indeed, seems 
to require but little condderation to render it evident. 
Yet it is veiy generaUy misconceived* That prolifie 
source of mistake^ the ambiguity of terms, operates

very Avidely in introducing confusion of thought into 
all portions of tbe inquiry. The nature of the proof 
on which the ^ theories^" as they are often termed, 
of natural philosophy depend — ^the distinction be- 
tween inductive conclusions and hypotheses — the 
relative use and importance of the two — and the 
consequent nature and security of Jthe basis on which 
natural theology rests, — are all points on which there 
seems to me great need of attempts at a better 
elucidation than is commonly afforded. And in 
immediate connexion with these topics, the relation 
in which the scripture stands to philosophy, (esped* 
aUy where its expressions may be opposed to the 
conclusions of science,) is a point most pre-eminently 
requiring to be better explained* 

By all thinking inquirers, indeed, the importance 
of the study of nature as subservient to the great 
aigument of natural theology, is generally admitted ; 
and the evidences which it affords are for the most 
part such as address themselves powerfully to the 
conviction even of the least instructed inquirer. And 
it is not one of the least weighty considerations in 
fiivour of the same great inferences, that their evi* 
donees are of a nature in some way appreciable by 
minds of all classes and constitutions, and of all 
degrees of cultivation. Hie most cursory survey of 
nature inspires reflections of the same high tendency 
in the most illiterate^ as the profoundest investigation 
does in the most philosophical. And the more closely

reduced under general laws, the more powerful is tbe 
weight of the evidence, to every intellect prepared to 
profit bj such inquiiy. To supply all the detail of 
such proofs, drawn from the innumerable particular 
cases evincing design and arrangement in the mate* 
rial world, has been the object of the labours of a 
long and distinguished series of writers. 

But however manifest may be the particular proofs 
which reflection deduces from the observed order of 
nature, — however clear the varied features of the 
view presented to our contemplation by a closer 
survey, yet no small degree of confusion and per- 
plexity often prevails, as to the distinct grounds and 
order of the reasoning. 

And however elaborately followed up the details 
may have been, much still seems requisite in eluci* 
dation of the great principles of the inquiry. And 
in a searching and inquiring age, it becomes more 
peculiarly needful to analyze the nature of our 
evidence ; and to be able, with that confidence which 
belongs to a good and just cause, to meet any sera* 
tiny, and to challenge any fair inquiry, into the 
grounds of our convictions; for which we can be 
duly prepared only by going fearlessly into the more 
precise examination of the actual principles which 
are involved in the reasoning. 

It has been well observed by Dr. Turton**^ Natural 

theology tf, in fact, natural ph^Oeophy— 

physical science in its utmost extent — studied with 
especial attention to the marks of design^ which

are in succession furnished by the objects of inquiiy*." 
It has also been emphatically and eloquently said, by 
another writer of the present day, ** The study of 
natural philosophy and natural theology, if rightly 
pursued, are one ; and true science but a perpetual 
worsliip of God in the firmament of his powerf •** 

Now the object of the ensuing discussion is precisely 
to show haw and why, this is the case; tit what sense, 
and an what grounds, the identity of the two can be 
maintained. And by carefully analyzing the nature 
of our impressions and convictions, to render more 
secure the steps by which we ascend to these sublime 
truths; and to expose more fully the errors and 
inconsistences by which such advance is too often 
impeded, the proper relation and dependence of 
the several parts and stages of the inquiry dis- 
turbed, and the connexion and force of the whole 
broken and destroyed. 

The importance and precise office of physical 
science in the support of Divine truth, altogether, 
has been too commonly overlooked, or misunder- 
stood ; and often so totally misconceived as to give 
rise to. the most unhappy pr^udices and lamentable 
hostility against it. 

According to views of the subject, not only popu- 
larly received, but even supported by the sanction of 
relipous authority, the entire order and tendency of 
the inquiry seems to be wholly mistaken and inverted.

Natural philosophj is considered to engage the mind 
in the studj of what are termed ** second causes:*" such 
inquiries are supposed to have a direct tendency to 
withdraw the thoughts fix>m the ** first cause.** It 
is, therefore, the business of natural theology to 
remedy this evil : though even natural theology is 
incompetent entirely to produce the desired effect ; 
and the authority of Revelation must be called in to 
check the vain inquiries of reason ; which, indeed, it 
is generally safer and better to avoid, and condemn 
altogether. 

Such is the confusion of ideas very commonly 
prevalent ; and which it is even considered impious 
to attempt to expose ! 

Yet, at the hazard of offending all such prejudices, 
I shall proceed to an unshrinking examination of 
the real order and connexion of the evidences of 
physical science, natural theology, and Revelation, 
as mutually dependent upon and affecting each other. 

That illiterate fanatics should inveigh with all the 
bitterness of sincere bigotry against the cultivation 
of science, is less a matter of surprise than of pity. 
But to find a similar course pursued by those who 
are the professed disciples of a purer and more 
rational creed, must be a subject of deep regret to 
every friend of truth. To find sentiments derogatory 
to the use of reason and the cultivation of the Intel- 
lect, coming from those who^ by learning, statiout 
and character, ought to be the friends and advocatea 
of all sound and rational acquirements; to bear the

condemnation of physical research, as beset ivith 
danger to religion, from those who ought to know its 
value as the sole basis of natural theology, must, 
under any circumstances, be regretted, not only by 
the advocates of science as such, but above all, by 
the real friends of religion. 

To that unfortunate deficiency in our systems of 
public education, by which physical science is prac- 
tically excluded, or, at best, degraded to a veiy 
secondary rank, we must ascribe the deplorably low 
views of its nature and value which pervade the 
writings of many, who, in other respects, are among 
the brightest ornaments of the Church and the Uni- 
versities. They are perpetually representing these 
pursuits as solely concerned with the dominion of 
man over the material elements, and solely applied, 
or applicable, to the arts of life. Thus incompetent 
to appreciate the high intellectual and moral influx 
ence of a devotion to the study of nature, they are 
sometimes led, not only to deny such influence, but 
even to accuse these pursuits of a tendency opposed 
to all religious impressions. 

No effectual remedy for such a state of things will 
probably be found until physical science shall be 
duly recognised as an essential branch of a liberal 
education, especially in the Universities. So long as 
the public in general are unable to judge of scientific 
pretensions, philosophy will be degraded by the pro- 
tendons of quackery : and this will give a colour to 
the accusations of bigotiy : the public mind will be

imposed upon by the misrepresentations of crafty 
Jesuitism, or the declamations of blind fanatidsm. 
To expose such mischievous errors is one main 
object of the ensuing pages. / 

But it is to be hoped that this state of things may 
not continue. It is to be hoped on every account^ 
for the sake of society itseli^ as well as of science ; 
for the sake of the general intellectnal improvement 
of mankind, as well as of the encouragement of 
research ; and above all, for the sake of the moral 
and religious influence which tme science never can 
fail to secure as affording the sole rational foundatipn 
of natural theology, and by consequence of all further 
religious truth. 

And if, as indeed there seems abundant promise 
may before long be the case, the course of public 
opinion shall take a direction in accordance with the 
just claims of physical science how infinitely more 
pernicious will it be that this absurd and unhappy 
hostility should be cherished and kept up, on the 
part of those who ought to be the ministers and 
disseminators of truth. 

To expose, then, such mischievous errors as those 
just adverted to, to explain the real bearing of phy* 
sical science, and vindicate its essential services to 
natural theology, and in its consequences to revealed 
religion also, forms a main objeet of my discussion.

Introduction. 



The Inductive Philosophy stands forth as the dis- 
tinguishing boast of modem intellectual advance- 
ment, and the prolific source of innumerable advan- 
tages, — omental, moral, and physical It has opened 
the path now universally recognised as alone leading 
to the correct interpretation of nature; of that 
stupendous order of varied existence, and incessant 
activity of causation, with which we are surrounded 
and filled. It is jusUy characterized as a method 
framed in conformity to experience; and stands 
essentially opposed to those artificial systems of 
former ages, which were but the vain chimeras of 
minds bewildered in the obscurities of verbal mysti- 
cism, or deluded by the conceits of gratuitous hypo- 
; systems which cramped all eneigy of thooght

and inveiitioD, and fettered all freedom of opinion 
and discussion. By a combination of vague and 
unmeaning abstractions, involved in a pedantic jar- 
gon of empty terms, the scholastic disputants 
thought to settle the order of natural causes, and 
determine what must be the character of physical 
laws. From a few abstract, and those hardly intel- 
ligible, arbitrary positions, they affected to advance^ 
by the mere subtilty of their reasoning powers, to a 
comprehension of the entire system of the material 
universe. 

But the appeal to experiment and observation, 
and the high and pure physical philosophy inculcated 
by Bacon, and practically followed up by Galileo^ 
Newton, and their successors, soon established the 
dominion of principles, at once more correct and 
rational, and better suited to the limited range of 
the human faculties. By the humble unpretending 
path of the inductive method, all the great triumphs 
of physical discovery have been achieved ; by a 
steady adherence to its principles, can we alone 
expect the further extension of natural knowledge ; 
and so long as they are adhered to, we can assign 
no limit to the progressive advance which may be 
made. And minds duly impressed with the sub- 
limity of those inquiries which the contemplation of 
the universe suggests, will easily recognise the truth 
and value of this method. They perceive^ in the refe- 
rence to observation and experience, an appeal to the 
sole authority of nature : they would interrogate her 
in her own language, and in the replies to those inter-

rogatories, afforded by experimental results, acknow- 
ledge the only real testimony to physical truth;-- 
the only means by which the laws of the material 
world can be successfully elicited and established ; 
and by which simplicity and order are educed out of 
the yast mass and (as might appear) inextricable 
complexity of accumulated phenomena. 

The claims of the Inductive Pliilosophy are in- 
deed now generally allowed, and its praises held 
forth ; still, not unfrequently, even its advocates and 
encomiasts entertain very indistinct notions of the 
real nature of the system they support, and it be- 
comes the more necessary to examine carefully the 
nature of tlie reasoning^ and the general ground$ qf 
tJie ecidencCf by which experimental laws, and physi- 
cal truths, are substantiated ; and this, in fact, is 
what is meant by the expressions so commonly used, 
the inductive method,'* ** the inductive logic^** 
experimental evidence,** and the like. The object 
of the present section is to analyze their meanings 
and endeavour to exemplify and elucidate the nature 
of our convictions and inferences, in these branches 
of knowledge; the degree of certainty of which 
they are susceptible ; and the sources of failure and 
error to which we are most exposed in the proseon^ 
tion of physical inquiry, without some well-grounded 
principles of this kind as our guide. And without 
restricting ourselves to too formal and technical a 
method, to examine briefly the real nature of the 
inductive process : and to illustrate^ by fiuniliar ex* 
amples, wherein the most essential and characteristic

features of inductive evidence consist^ as distinguished 
on the one hand from the mere evidence of our 
senses, and on the other firom demonstration. 

Meaning and Nature of Indadiom. 

At the present day, so common is the use of the 
term ^ Inductive Philosophy," that, it may be pre* 
sumed, there are few persons who have not at least 
some apprehension of the sort of investigation 
which it is used to designate. 

In its more general signification, this term is 
employed to describe the entire method of modem 
physical science, as peculiarly characterized by rest- 
ing on the appeal to experiment and observation 
alone; and as contra-distinguished from the scho- 
lastic systems, which proposed to reason downwards 
from abstract principles to natural laws and pheno- 
mena : the inductive, on the contrary, ascends firom 
observed phenomena to general laws and abstract 
prindples. 

In its more limited sense, however, ^ induction* 
is understood to signify the process of inferring and 
collecting general results, general facts, or ** laws^** 
from a number of particular instances, carefully 
established on actual experimental evidence. It is 
the nature of the process, thus designated, and the 
principles on which it is conducted, that we propose 
to explain and comment upon. 

Now, it is dear that the first step in such a pro- 
cess^ must be the collection and classification of a 
number of particular phenomena : the careful

mination of a nnmber of individual casesi in wder 
to discover some common property or circnmrtanoe 
in which they all agree, amid many others in idiieh 
they differ*. 

Does then the process consist merely in thifl^ fhat 
we examine every individual of a classy or number of 
objects before us, and, finding each one to poness a I 

particular property, affirm that as a common pro- | 

perty of the class ? This, certainly, would imply no ! 

exercise of reasoning, and would hardly be worthy 
the name of induction. We should be merely 
affirming a proposition for whose truth we had the 
direct evidence of our senses. Yet perhaps among 
cases even of this sort, there may exist much diffisr« 
ence as to the extent and labour of the reseaidk we 
may have to go through, in detecting the one pro- 
perty, which is common to all the individual cases^ 
and constitutes the characteristic by which we give 
them a common classification and a generic name. 
The point in which all the examined instances agrees 
may, indeed, be manifest at first sight. But^ sgaint 
it may be fitr otherwise ; and though vre have all the 
cases before us, (especially if they be numerous^) it 
may yet require no small labour and skill to snoceed 
in tracing out what the property or circumstance is 
in which they all agrees amidst a variety of others 
in which they differ. The first case requires nothing 
further than the bare inspection of the instances.

The latter may call forth mach discrimiiiatiTe skilL 
The former is the work of the mere collector : the 
latter may involve that of the philosopher. But in 
any case other than the most immediately obvious^ 
there is this to be remarked ; and it is deserving of 
particular attention : it is almost certun that» in the 
first instance, the mind will conjecturally fix upon 
some property, which is ima^ned (whether correctly 
I or not) most likely to be the common one sought^ 

long before a complete examination of all the indi- 
viduals has taken place*. 

Let us suppose, on the other hand, that we have 
fHd aB the individual facts before us. We observe 
a certain number of them, and finding them agree 
in some property, we are almost invariably prone at 
once to infer, that all the rest possess it likevnse. 
We infer more than we see. There is certainly a 
strong natural tendency in the human mind (even 
upon very slight apparent grounds) to advance from 
individual facts to general conclusions, — ^to hazard 
inferences firom the known to the unknown.

We have then next to inquire with what reason- 
able confidence can we make such inference ? For 
instance, suppose that feeling a number of balls in a 
bag^ we take out a few, and, finding them whiter 
I • infer that all the balls in the bag are white : is this 

I a Intimate induction ? Is it correct reasoning ; is

it not rather a most groundless presumption ? Yet 
it may be asked, does it not possess all the cbarac* 
teristics of induction, as they have been laid down 
by some logical writers? For wherein does the 
case we have supposed, differ from their commonly 
cited example : ^ This, that, and the other loadstone^ 
attracts iron, — ^therefore all loadstones do?** Or 
why is not the former of these instances as good 
reasoning as the latter ? 

In the case of the balls, we cannot assign or 
imagine any reason why one should be white because 
others are so; any supposable connexion between 
the circumstance of the balls being together in the 
bag, and their colour. There is no tendency to 
fancy or expect it. On the other hand, in the 
case of the loadstone, having observed the effect^ 
in a few instances, we feel a natural tendency to 
imagine that the same magnetic property subsists 
whenever we perceive the same external charac« 
teristics. We cannot avoid being persuaded that 
there is a connexion between that particular dark* 
ness of colour, weight, hardness, texture^ &C., by 
which we recognise the mineral, and a magnetic 
power, though we may be at a loss to explain w 
assign the ground for it. 

Yet the only thing which seems at all to warrant 
the induction from a limited number of instances^ 
is the reasonableness of such an intuitive persuasioiL 
When, therefore, we have only a limited number of 
instances, which we can examine (and such is the

case, in fact, in almost all physical inquiries,) no 
inductive inferences can properly be made, unless 
we feel assured of some probable ground for expect- 
ing a common connexion to subsist between the 
individual cases. Can we, then, succeed in tracing 
any probable principle to which the existence of 
such a persuasion may be traced ? — Can we analyse 
it up to any rational ground of belief? This is a 
most important point of our inquiry ; and to it our 
attention must next be directed. (See Note A.) 

Bdief in the Umformity of Nature. 

Now there is one grand, fundamental principle^ 
without which no induction of laws from particular 
instances, no generalizations of individual truths, no 
regular or systematic study of nature, could ever 
proceed : and this is our conviction of a permanence 
and uniformity in the order of natural things : our 
belief that that which has happened in succession 
for days and years past, vrill, under the same circum- 
stances, continue to happen for time to come : our 
persuasion that what so takes place in one instance, 
in one place, will and does take place, under the 
same conditions, in all other instances, and in all 
other places. We suppose, that is, that nature u jo 
cotutUutedf that there exists same principle of undo* 
viating regularity in the connexion of qualities and 
properties, of causes and effects, even though we 
should fail in always tracing it

This belief undoubtedly exists and operates in 
very different degrees in different minds. But a 
share of it, at least, is so universal, that some meta- 
physicians have been disposed to regard it as consti- 
tuting one of the inherent principles of our nature* 
Thus, the most ignorant person infers that the sun 
\rill rise to-morrow, and for succeeding days and 
years, because he has so regularly witnessed it 
before ; and that a stone fSodls to the ground as con« 
stantly in America as in Europe. 

In the limited form in which we commonly notice 
the operation of this sort of intuitive persuasion, it 
certainly does not amount to anything like a philo« 
sophical conviction of the uniformity of natural 
causes. It is, doubtless, restricted to certain iso« 
lated classes of facts, which in all their circumstances 
are constantly falling under the observation. In 
those limited instances, the individual, perhaps, 
relies on their recurrence from mere habit, which 
probably does not produce in his mind any general 
belief that other events beyond the limits of his 
observation are regulated by any like constant uni- 
formity. Nor when the idea is suggested is he able 
to perceive the force of the inference from analogy ; 
but, probably, imagines all things beyond the pre- 
cise extent of his observation to be destitute of any 
determinate order, and the course of events in

general, either under the dominion of arbitrary 
agency, or abandoned to chance or blind destiny. 

In proportion, however, as the mind is more cul* 
Uvated, and man accustomed to reflect and reason 
on the objects continually presented to his senses, 
he is naturally, and even unconsciously, led to en- 
large his persuasion of the general recurrence of 
natural phenomena, in the same order in which he 
has several times witnessed it. This persuasion 
easily extends itself to a great variety of particular 
instances, in which its correctness is soon verified 
by observation. The same habitual judgment thus 
guns strength by every hour^s experience. The 
confidence with which the mind calculates, as it 
were, upon the permanence of a certain order in 
physical events, increases with rapidly-accumulating 
force; and the improvement of the faculties by 
study, and the enlargement of our stores of infer* 
mation from wider observation of physical fiGtcts, 
soon begins to induce the habit of extending our 
persuasion of the uniformity of natural causes, be- 
yond the mere bounds of fSuniliar phenomena, to 
those which are placed out of our immediate exa^ 
mination, but which we come naturally to imagine 
must be regulated by a like constancy. 

Founded, then, on the natural constitution of the 
human mind, confirmed by daily experience^ and 
verified by every advance in the accurate study both 
of mental and material phenomena, the belief in 
the existence of this uniformity becomes^ in fiieti

ralize its observations, unite to supply, as it were^ 
at once the first impulse and primary elements of 
philosophic investigation. But it is further neces- 
sary that much care and skill be employed in tho 
direction and use of them before they can prodaoe 
any substantial results. We have then frirther to 
inquire how this is to be done ; and we shall find 
that the models by which we must be guided, are to 
be found in the careful and extended study of 
already established natural relations.

The principles by which we are to be 
advancing to sound generalizations of observed phy- 
sical relations, must be those derived from the care- 
ful study and comparison of such generalizations 
previously confirmed in other corresponding in- 
stances, which will suggest probabilities antecedent 
jto actual experience. 

It will be to little purpose that we are persuaded 
of the existence of wme uniformity in natural Um^

unless we have this guide to asust in tracing what 
the ]irinciple of uniformity is in any particular case 
Without such assistance, we may go on collecting 
and observing a vast number of &cts, and yet arrive 
at no conclusions, or only at such as are altogether 
empty and visionary. 

As we have already remarked, that merely to 
affirm what we observe in common of a number of 
individuals, all of which are before us, is hardly 
worthy the name of an induction, so it is a violation 
of all just induction to infer a general property from 
too limited a number of instances. But what consti- 
tutes the sufficient number of instances must depend 
on the nature of the case, and the experience and 
power of judgment possessed by the inquirer. 

And if we fall into the error of too small an in- 
duction, the usual cause of such error is rather that 
the induction is \v^nting in a just principle of pro- 
bability in our first conjecture, or that we have pro- 
ceeded on the supposition of a wrong sort of rela- 
tion. It is this which has commonly much more to 
do with the justness of our conclusion than the 
mere number of instances collected. And, on the 
other hand, it oflen happens that a very few in- 
stances^ or even almost a single instance, have been 
admitted without question as a sufficient verificatioii : 
but this has depended entirely on the justness of the 
assumed rdatkm. 

We win illustrate these remarks by a few ex- 
amples, both of successful and unsuccessful indiie- 
tionfl^ in different departments of science.

THE INDUCnVE METHOD. 23 

1. Newton, on jiassing a ray of light through a 
prism of glass, found it separated into coloured rays ; 
and measuring the proportion in which it is thus 
spread out, or ^ dispersed,** announced that propor- 
tion as the general law of prismatic dispersion. 

Dr. Lucas repeated the experiment ; but assigned 
a mtich less propai'tion as the law. Both parties posi- 
tively maintained the correctness of their res])ectiT6 
conclusions. But they had both argued on a fiuiltjr 
ground of induction: they had each taken for 
granted that their prisms ought to act equally on 
light. The fact was, they had used different sorts 
of glass, which vary considerably in disperdve 
power. 

Tliis is remarkable as one of the very few instance 
in which Newton ffdlcd in an induction ; but sadi 
failures are instructive ; for we learn to observe the 
reason of the error. It was manifestly from neglect- 
ing to consider, in this case, what probabilihf there 
Mould be, previous to trials that different sorts of 
glass should possess the same dispersive power. 

On the other hand, Newton's capital result that 
** to the same ray ever belongs the same refrangi- 
bility,** (the media being the same,) is a condusioiip 
indeed, of a most general nature, and which universal 
experience has amply confirmed, but it vras founded 
on a very limited induction derived from prismatio 
experiments vnth, at most» three or four different 
media.

examples of the compatibilitj of accumulated obser- 
vation with the want of satisfiEU^tory induction. The 
ancient astronomers were inde&tigable in the dili« 
gcnce with which they amassed observations. But 
ihej constructed out of them no theoiy which could 
attain a real permanence. The system of Ptolemy 
sufficed to a certain extent to represent the observed 
motions of the planets. The advance in accuracy 
of observations, however, soon required correspond- 
ing improvements in the system ; which was obliged 
to be modified to accord with them : but, at length, 
the immense complexity introduced by the cycles 
and epicycles which were necessary to account for 
the apjiarent motions, began to induce a persuasion 
that such complication could not be the real law of 
nature : juster principles were therefore to be sought. 
No astronomer ever laboured more sedulously in 
making and recording observations, than Tycho 
Brahe. But though ]>er8uaded of the insufficiency 
of the Ptolemaic hyiK)thesis, he did not succeed in 
constructing a better : not from deficiency of facts, 
but from his strangely-erroneous assumption of a 
guiding theoretical principle. 

Kepler worked upon Tycho's materials. The 
labour M'hich he bestowed on calculation was abso- 
lutely incredible. But tlieoiy after theoiy was 
adopted and rejected, because he had not any other 
guide than random conjecture, and nothing but the 
accurate calculation of every detail could suffice to 
put those conjectures to the test Ho had not

lighted on anj happy ground of antecedent proba^ 
bilittf. AVlien, however, at last, ho did seize upon 
the true law of nature, the numerical verification 
was perfect and decisive ; and when thus established 
in the single instance of the planet Mar8» it is 
extremely instructive to observe the rapidity and 
facility with which the inference was extended to 
the whole solar system. 

When the laws of the motion of one planet were 
established, a single conjecture sufficed to point out» 
%\ith the highest degree of probability, the laws of 
all the other planetary orbits : and a single calcula^ 
tion to verify it. The difference was, that there 
was now a ground of antecedent probability ; a pre* 
sumption of a guiding resemblance, which (though 
not strictly proved) was yet such as to leave no 
doubt that it had some foundation in nature. 

Analogy tlie Chvtmd of antecedent Probability. 

Thus, then, it is manifest, that to possess some 
reasonable ground of antecedent probability, as a 
guide to our conclusion, is absolutely essential to 
physical induction. And we cannot employ the 
term correctly in its higher sense, (as referring to 
anything above a mere collection of instances,) with- 
out meaning to include s|>ecially the notion of a fair 
presumption of some relation, in virtue of which we 
can argue from the known to the unknown; and 
infer that those cases which w^ 4o pot 8ee» are pro«

bably connected with tbose which we do. This con* 
stitutes one most essential characteristic of the 
inductive process ; and without it, assuredly we can 
never advance to a substantial conclusion. We 
must always, then, consider the inductive method as 
referring, not merely to the accumulation of in- 
stances, but as vwdting the idea of some presiding 
conception^ some guiding principle^ of presumed cofi- 
neanon and probable rdation between the facts on 
which we are reasoning. 

In replying, then, to the inquiry. What constitutes 
the ground of antecedent probability, so essential to 
a good induction ? it will be almost apparent, from 
the examples already cited, that the main ground is 
that afforded by the comparison of one doss of phe^ 
fiOfnena with another : the perception of a paralldism 
in their respective conditions : the existence of an 
ANALOGY between them. 

The success, then, with which induction may be 
carried on, depends on the just appreciation of such 
trains of analogy. This can only be attained by a 
habit of cautiously comparing our presumed gene- 
ralization with already established laws. One induc- 
tion must be the guide to another. We must seek 
to interpret nature in agreement with her own 
principles already displayed. Every real natural 
truth, we may be assured, will be in harmony with 
other parts of the great series and scale of natural 
truth. With this our hypothesis must be in accord- 
ance ; to ascertiun and verify such accordance is the

aim of the true philosopher ; and it is entirely on 
the justness with which it is preserved that the 
whole truth and success of induction depends. 

Observation exhibits a certain law or relation 
among a particular class of facts. This suggests to 
the mind of the philosopher the probability of the 
same relation in another collection of facts, which 
leads to the belief that the cases are parallel. The 
relation being firmly established in one set of in- 
stances, he feels satisfied Avith even a slight indica- 
tion of it in the other. The conviction of its pro- 
bability once formed, a very few cases adduced serve 
to verify it. The experience of instances actually 
tried, leads to the expectation of analogous results 
in cases untried. But the essential point is the real 
parallelism of the cases. The hypothesis will be 
philosophical or not, according to the extent and 
justness of the comparison which has suggested it. 

For example (I.) Experiment had shown that 
electricity in a high state of tension discharges itself 
vnth a flash and a report Lightning and thunder 
exhibited an instance of a flash and a report The 
atmosphere was known to be susceptible of eleo- 
trical influence. All this bad been ascertained, but 
no relation had been established between the cases. 
Other causes might possibly produce a flash an4 a 
report But the analogy of electricity presented 
itself strongly to the philosophic mind of Franklin. 
By the string of a kite^ as a conductor, he brought 
down the electricity of the clouds, which, on its

arrival at tlie ground, was regularly discharged with 
sjiarks, and the analogy couTerted into an identity. 

(2.) Every one had been accustomed for ages, 
before the time of Newton, to observe, that bodies 
fall to the ground as soon as support is withdrawn. 
They were equally fiuniliar with the fact, that the 
moon circulates periodically about the earth. But 
no one ever perceived any relation or imaginable 
connexion between these two classes of fietcts. Nay, 
the peripatetics, mdntaining that the heavenly mo« 
tions were of an essentially different kind from the 
terrestrial, led men to the belief that these two cases 
could not possibly have any common relation. 

The penetrating mind of Newton, however, in- 
stantly perceived a connexion between them. He 
considered that a body launched into space would 
continue to move off* in a straight line, unless made 
to deviate from that path by the action of some other 
cause. Now the moon does not go off* in a recti- 
linear path, but has her course continually j^ f rom 
such direction into a curvilinear orbit round the 
earth ; and the degree in which it is thus bent, or 
the amount of doAiation from the straight course^ is 
in fact, so much of a real fall towards the earth : 
the moon is actually falling like a stone : and the 
amount of its fell can be measured ; since astrono- 
mical observation has given the size and form of 
its orbit, and the rapidity of its motion, that i% 
Uio amount of the deviation. Also the amount 
of the foil of a stone near the enrth's surface

18 known. It becomes a matter of calculation 
to compare them. Newton made the comparison, 
and found the two effects precisely in the inverse 
proportion of the squares of the distances from the 
eartVs centre. This was the precise proportion 
which would agree with the supposition of that law 
of central force, which, on abstract mechanical prin* 
ciples, ought to gtye rise to elliptic orbits^ and to 
certain relations expressed by numerical laws between 
the magnitudes of those orbits and the motions in 
them. These were the very same as those numerical 
relations which had been found by Kepler long before 
to subsist in the planetary revolutions. 

Thus the single circumstance of the amdogjf be- 
tween the moon's motion and that of a stone faUing 
to the ground, sufficed as a clue to the whole system 
of planetary motions, and the establishment of the 
principle of universal gravitation. 

(3.) Physical philosophers had been long seeking 
to establish (what there was eveiy reason to suspect) 
the existence of at least a close connexion, if not 
absolute identity, between electricity, galvanism, and 
magnetism. There were many points of resemblance 
in what was known of the nature of those agents ; 
experiments had been multiplied, and many curious 
fiicts and results had been accumulated. But all 
this collection of fads had not afforded a real uM/ifo- 
iion. And the reason was, that the inquirers had 
been guided either by no principle of analogy, or by 
sucli as was inoomct

The most powerful electric forces had been re- 
sorted to ; but no evolution of galvanic influence, no 
shock, however strong, would affect the magnetic 
needle. Experimenters were accustomed to witness 
the most intense electric action when the current 
was brokeUf or the accumulated power discharged; 
here, therefore, they expected to find the greatest 
effect of a magnetic kind. 

But these modes of action were of a kind offering 
no analogy to those really concerned in the cases in 
question. This, however, was not perceived, till 
(Ersted discovered the true point of connexion of 
electricity and magnetism. He succeeded, by a very 
slight change in the arrangement from that with 
which his predecessors had been so long and so 
fruitlessly working. By using an unbroken galvanic 
circuit, he instantly found an influence on the mag* 
netic needle : not by violent concentration of forces 
but by a peculiar diffusion of them. And the whole 
system of action by transverse currents was almost 
immediately developed and followed out into all its 
correlative trains of consequences. 

(4.) Newton published his Prinapia before any 
instance of the periodical return of a comet had been 
established, or even imagined. Yet, on comjmring 
the masses of these bodies and their distances with 
those of the planets, he caught an analogy, and did 
not hesitate to speak positively of their describing 
orbits about the sun, and to recommend to future 
astronomers to verify their returns by comparison of

observations*. It is superfluous to notice how 
completely this idea has been borne out by subse- 
quent discoveries. 

(5.) In the extension of the law of gravitation 
from the foil of a stone on the earth to the motions 
of the most distant planet or the most erratic comet, 
we have a remarkable instance where a conclusion is 
made from effects which we observe near us, to those 
of the same kind which are produced in the remotest 
regions of space. Let us compare this with a parallel 
case in time. We observe the daily formation of 
rounded pebbles by the action of the waves on frag- 
ments of rock on the sea-shore ; and we find the 
incessant continuance of that action for a long time 
give rise to accumulated beds of shingle. 

Now, over large tracts of land, at considerable 
elevations above the sea, we find immense beds of 
jiebbles presenting precisely the same appearance of 
rolled and rounded fragments, as those we now 
observe in the progress of formation in the sea. It 
is, then, by the same process of reasoning which 
connects the gravitation of a stone with that of the 
moon, or the remotest planet or comet, that we 
connect the formation of beds of pebbles at the 
present day with that of similar beds in ages of 
remote antiquity, when the present dry land formed 
the bottom of the ocean ; or, rather, was graduaUy 
emerging from it, through such a long succession

Force (^Physical Analogies. 

Philosophical induction, then, proceeds mainly by 
seizing upon analogies between known orders of 
facts, known relations of cause and effect, and cases 
where the existence of such relations is unknown, 
but where the circumstances render it probable that 
they also subsist. Such circumstances, perhaps quite 
casual and unimportant in the eyes of the ordinary 
observer, suggest in an instant, to the practised mind 
of the philosophical inquirer, a train of relations in 
which the analogy is maintained. He proceeds to 
verify his idea : a single experimental instance often 
suffices to confirm it ; and at most, a very few repe- 
titions and variations in the circumstances and con- 
ditions, satisfy him that his analogy is correct, and 
the uniformity of the law by which physical action 
is determined becomes established. 

In feet, so essential to induction is the dependence 
on analogy, tliat in the very use of the terms, 
** observation,** ** experience,** and the like, by many 
writers^ to describe the grounds of our belief in phy« 
sical events, it is evident that they mean to include 
aseHtiaHjf the reference to analogy^ and not barely to 
ftcts actually witnessed. Unless this be the case^

indeed, their meaning would, in some cases, be 
involved in absurdity and contradiction. 

Thus, then, the most important part of the process 
of induction consists in seizing upon the probable 
connecting relation by which we can extend what 
we observe in a few cases to all. In proportion to 
the justness of this assumption, and the correctness 
of our judgment in tracing and adopting it, will the 
induction be successful. The methods by which a 
facility in discovering such relations, and a readiness 
in forming such judgment, may be attained and 
improved, are precisely the objects principally to be 
kept in view by the philosophical student who would 
prepare himself for the work of interpreting the 
phenomena of the natural world. The analogies to 
be pursued must be those suggested from already- 
ascertained laws and relations. This, in proportion 
to the extent of the inquirer's previous knowledge of 
such relations subsisting in other parts of nature^ 
will be his means of guidance to a correct train of 
inference in that before him. 

And he who has, even to a limited extent, been 
led to observe the connexion between one class of 
physical truths and another, will almost unconsd- 
ously acquire a tendency to perceive such relations 
among the fiicts continually presented to him. The 
truth of the remark to which we have been thus 
led is amply confirmed by the history of philosophical 
discoveiy.

inductive, have very seldom been really attuned by 
the mere process of amassing collections of individual 
facts. It has been almost invariably the case that 
hypothesis has preceded observation ; and that the 
discoverer has in truth only verified, by an appeal to 
experiment, the general theory which he had already 
imagined. The happy selection of such hjrpotheses 
is that which characterizes, and in fact constitutes, 
philosophical genius. And a just appreciation of the 
use of such imaginary provisional assumptions, emi- 
nently distinguishes the rational inquirer from the 
speculative visionary. The true philosopher neither 
discards hypothesis on the one hand, nor yields him- 
self up to it on the other ; but rates it at its proper 
value, and turns it to its legitimate use. He is 
always ready to reject an assumed theory the moment 
he finds it unsupported by fact : but if it be once 
duly substantiated, to adopt it, and be prepared to 
follow it out into all its legitimate consequences, 
however at variance with received notions — however 
contrary to established prejudices — ^however opposed 
to the prepossessions, the bigotry, the cherished 
delusions of mankinds 

And the more extensive his acquaintance with 
nature, the more firmly is he impressed with the 
belief that some such relation must subsist in all 
eases, however limited a portion of it he may be 
able actually to trace. And it is by the exercise of 
an unusual skill in this way, that the greatest philo- 
sophers have been able to achieve their triumphs in

tlic reduction of facts under the dominion of general 
laws. 

But important as these natural analogies are to 
the philosopher, they are yet of a nature which 
renders it difficult to make them generally appre- 
ciated : and, unless by actual and attentive study of 
physical science, it is difficult to convey an adequate 
conception of the irresistible claim to acceptance 
with which they present themselves to the mind of 
a person even moderately versed in such inquiries. 
Yet they are, in fact, no more than extensions of 
the very same elements of thought, which seem 
implanted in our nature ; by which all our acquaint- 
ance with sensible objects is, in the first instance^ 
acquired; and by which we are continually and 
unconsciously storing our minds with that knowledge 
which is so necessary for all the purposes of our 
existence ; — those natural persuasions upon which all 
uniform convictions, and all consistent conduct, is 
based ; — and without which life would be a continued 
state of infistnqr. 

Matliematical Law$. 

It is not, perhaps, until we come to contemplate 
natural phenomena, exhibited in the form of nume- 
rical results, and find those data reducible to mathe- 
matical laws, that we fully appreciate the reality and 
exactness of that uniformity by which all nature 
works. The coincidence with such laws, it that

nrliich, above all others, impresses as with the con- 
viction of invariable order and nniformitj pervading 
the material universe. 

We find this, in the first instancy in the reduc- 
tion of vast collections of observed numerical results, 
under simple mathematical formulas. . But the more 
extended application of mathematical analysis power- 
fullj augments the impression produced on our 
minds by the conspiring inductions; and corroborating 
generalizations, of purely physical investigations. 
From some one very simple^ remote, and abstract 
datum, obtained from elementary physical facts, we 
often proceed by purely mathematical reasoning, 
perhaps through a long and intricate deduction, 
which at length brings us to the conclusion, that, 
under certain conditions, a particular kind of action 
ought to take place ; and even the precise amount 
of its effects ought to be such as are given by a 
certain analytical expression. The results of obser- 
vation exactly accord with these deductions; and 
even the minutest variations in the effects are 
exactly represented by calculation from the formula 
of theory. 

We have occasionally singular exemplifications of 
the existence of recondite principles of analogy, in 
the coincidence of phenomena with the symbolical 
indications of mathematical analyds. A mathema- 
tical formula is found, which expresses the law of a 
certain class of phenomena. The analytical language 
<tf symbols admits, perhaps; of certain changes; or

embraces certain cases, not at all contemplated in 
the first numerical establishment of the law; but 
dejiendent purely upon abstract algebraical rules and 
transformations. These symbolical changes shall be 
found to have physical cases exactly corresponding 
to them. 

In the higher departments of phydcal optics^ 
this has been most surprisingly exemplified. We 
need only cite the marvellous prediction of the 
conversion of plane into circular polarization of 
light, by two internal reflections in glass, made and 
verified by M. Fresnel, entirely upon the strength of 
certain mechanical and mathematical analogies. ** A 
conclusion," (as Professor Forbes justly remarks,) 
** which no general acuteness could have foreseen ; 
and which was founded on the mere analogy of cer- 
tain interpretations of imaginary expressions. The 
mere reasoner about phenomena could never have 
arrived at the result, — ^the mere mathematician 
would have repudiated a deduction founded upon 
analogy alone*.**

a naturalist^ in his researches, happening to find 
only a hoof, directly and certainly infers that it ¥ras 
associated with grinding teeth, having flat surfaces^ 
a long alimentary canal, a large stomach, or several ; 
and many other similar cliaracteristics. Yet such 
conclusions are of a nature strictly inductive. 
Again, the system of the organs of motion is 
universally found to be so a^usted, that a variation 
in the form of one bono is invariably accompanied 
by variations more or less in all the others. Thus 
in any new case which may present itself, from a 
single bone the skilful naturalist will often be able 
to infer the form of the whole skeleton. On what 
does the legitimacy of such inferences depend : on 
what ground of confidence can such reasoning be 
pursued, but on the assurance of those unfailing 
principles of analogy which unquestionably pervade 
the entire range of organized nature, and thus sup- 
ply the main ground of stability to these inductive 
conclusions. 

That whenever a new plant or animal is dis- 
covered, we should never come to any thing ano- 
malous or at variance vrith systematic order; but 
that, even in those instances which are apparently 
the most unlike any previously known, the skilful 
naturalist should always succeed in assigning to the 
production in question its precise place in the scale 
and order of organized beings, and that all fresh dis- 
coveries should but fill up blanks in the scheme^ is

ciple of the most recondite tmiformity throughout 
all the modifications of organized structures. In 
fact, to elucidate and deyeloi)e such principles of 
uniformity and analogy, has been the very object of 
the labours of the most eminent naturalists ; and 
the best proof of the actual prevalence and ad« 
mirable unity of those principles is found in the 
increasing simplicity to which the arrangement of 
natural classes has been reduced. 

Tlius the researches of Cuvier reduce the laws of 
animated existence to only four princijial " types,** 
or general schemes of organization, founded on the 
presence or absence of vertebrae, after which (as he 
observes,) all animals appear to have been modelled ; 
and of which the subordinate divisions are only 
comparatively slight modifications, founded on the 
developcment or addition of certain parts, which 
produce no essential change in the original plan : 
viz^ 1. The Vertebrata, with bony skeletons; 2. The 
MoUusca, soft;, with shells ; 3. The Articulata, jointed 
or ringed ; 4. The Radiata, or zoophytes. 

Within the limits of each of these four classes, 
Cuvier traced a precise set of analogies among all 
their various subdivisions ; so that for every member 
. or organ in one species, there was to be found in- 
variably some member or oigan in all the others^ 
holding exactly the same place in relation to the 
general structure and nature of the animal; and 
thus between the two extreme instances which fidl 
under any one class, though there might exist the

utmost possible dimmilarittf in every respect, yet 
there was found the closest andogy ; in every crea- 
ture of that class could be pointed out by the skil- 
fill comparative anatomist, an exact correspondence 
in the nature and office of every part relative to the 
nature of the animal, though bearing not the 
slightest resemblapice. When, however, these great 
classes themselves were compared together, such 
analogy seemed to be no further traceable. Each 
class seemed to include a distinct plan of organiza- 
tion, possessing an unity within itself, but not appa- 
rently related to that of the other classes. But 
these views have been pushed further; another 
school of physiologists, among whom Geoffi:ey St* 
Hilaire stands most conspicuous, have contended 
that even these breaks between the four classes may 
be filled up, and new principles of analogy deve- 
loped and traced out, by which these apparently dis- 
tinct plans of organization may bo shown to have a 
common system of relation; and thus throughout 
all classes, a principle of still more recondite con- 
nexion be percrived. 

This principle carried out to its full extent, has 
been named the ^ unity of plan or of composition,** 
or the ** theory of analogues,** and the particular 
views of structure by which it is upheld, have been 
designated as the ^ equilibrization of organs^** or 
other similar names. ^Vhile, however, the main 
principle of the reality of some such system of pri* 
mitive tyjies is universally recognised by naturalists^

yet considerable difference of opinion prevails as to 
the details of its application, and as to the extent to 
which it may be followed out And the question 
which has thus arisen has occasioned conaderable 
controversy between the . partisans of the two rival 
schools ; principally, perhaps, in consequence of its 
being mixed up with other topics, with which it has 
at least no necessary connexion ; and to which we 
shall recur in another place. With reference to our 
present purpose, it will be sufficient to remark 
simply, that the question between these theories^ or 
rather the question whether the CAiensioii given to 
the great principle of uniformity by the second of | 
them, is true^ must be decided merely by physiolo- ' 
gical evidence : it is purely a question of fadt and 
must be investigated by careful examination and 
enlightened comparison of facts and analogies, with- 
out any reference to the speculative topics with 
which it has been mixed up ; a distinction which, 
however plain, seems to have been too much over* 
looked. 

But however this question may be determined, 
our chief consideration should be to observe, either 
way, how beautiful an extension of the great prin- 
ciples of natural order and harmonious arrangement . 
is opened to our view. And it is the increasing 
assurance of this which is continually strengthening 
the foundation of all our inductive reasonings; of 
all consistent and profitable search into the laws of 
the material creation.

Induction in Geology. 

We meet vrith perhaps the most remarkable in- 
stances of the application of the inductive concla« 
sions of comparative anatomy in deciphering the 
liistoiy of foBsil remains. The whole subject is, in 
in fact, only a continued series of such inferences. 
The entire structure, nature, and habits of animals 
once inhabiting the earth, are deduced from the 
occurrence of a few bones, or perhaps a single tootht 
or scale, embedded and mineralized in some now 
solid rock ; and yet with the full force of inductive 
evidence. 

It is upon the study of fossil organic remains that 
the conclusions of geology mainly depend. And in 
a more general point of view, the researches of this 
science afford some of the best examples of the vast 
range of inference to which strict induction may 
be extended ; of conclusions apparently the most 
remote, the most inconceivable, the most startling; 
yet all evinced by the same rigidly inductive process 
by which the most palpable laws of mechanical 
action are established. Tlie observer finds at vari« 
ons elevations above the sea, beds of shells^ and 
remains of marine animals, buried beneath the soil, 
or imbedded in the solid rock ; he comes most legi- 
timately to the conclusion that these relics were 
buried when the beds of sofl or rock were in the 
])roce88 of formation, in a soft state; when they 
formed, in fact, the bottom of the waters in which.

or on the margin, tlie animals lived and died ; and 
tliat these beds have since been Imd di7» and de* 
vated into their present pomtion. 

Again he finds one sort of earth or rock extend- 
ing over a considerable tract, from beneath which, at 
the edge of that tract, another of a widely different 
species comes up, and appears at the surfiice^ show- 
ing its relative position wherever a section maj be 
made, and proved to exist under the other wherever 
a well is simk to a sufficient depth. He infers that 
the lower was deiK)sited before the upper. And this 
simply on the same evidence as that on which we 
believe that the roof of a house was built at a later 
time than the foundation, though we did not wit- 
ness it 

Again, the geologist calls in the aid of the natu- 
ralist; in the upper strata, the fossil remuns are 
found nearly agreeing with existing species ; in the 
lower, some perhaps the same, but many totally dif- 
ferent ; belonging, that is, to species not now known 
to exist. He carries on the research, and in another 
still lower stratum, of a different kind of material, 
finds fewer, or none, of existing species, and many, 
or all, extinct species. Nay, whole genera, and even 
orders of animals, successively disappearing, and new 
ones taking their place, as he comes into deeper 
deposits of other kinds of rock. His inference^ that 
in successive periods, different classes of bdngs 
inhabited the earth; that their races suooesnvely 
became extinct ; that new species were suooesBively

produced and destroyed iu like manner ; nntfl tbe 
present order of animated beings was thus gradnallj 
introduced, is a conclusion simply dependent on tlie 
very same grounds of induction, guided by analogy, 
as tbose by wbicb any of tbe most certain physical 
tnitbs are established. 

The appearances, in some instances, of the imbed- 
ding of organic remains may be those of a sudden 
destruction ; in others, of a gradual deposition and 
covering up of the remains of many generations of 
animals, dying in the course of nature, and in vari- 
ous stages of growth. The beds containing these 
deposits are superposed, to a vast number; and 
often alternate with others in which no organic 
remuns occur. It is from the consideration of all 
these and the like circumstances^ on every ground 
of analogy, and by the most strict induction, that 
the geologist arrives at his conclusion, that to bring 
about these results involved a series of events which 
required a long succession of ages for their accom- 
plishment. 

Again, when it is remarked that this applies not 
merely to the destruction of a vast multitude of indi- 
vidual creatures, but to the disappearance of entire 
spedeSf classes, and orders ; and that this disappear- 
ance is every where gradual, the prpportiom of the 
numbers of one species discovered co-existing with 
another, l)eing found to go through a reffddar oonse 
of diminution as we recede to older formations ; the 
same inference is further confirmed and extended.

Agdn, the upheaving and laying diy from the 
domains of the ocean of any laige portion of land, 
especially where it is destitute of all marks of for* 
cible disruption, or the apparent effects of sudden 
violence, must, by rational comparison, be inferred 
to have taken place by almost imperceptible de- 
grees. AVhen we combine these considerations with 
that of the number of superposed beds which obser- 
vation of the varieties of mineral character as well 
as of characteristic fossils discloses to us^ and of the 
limited local extent of each, we are necessitated, 
upon the lowest possible computation consistent 
with inductive inference, to assign an almost incal- 
culable series of ages to each one of those successive 
deposits, and, strictly in the spirit of inductive anap~ 
logy, to carry our inferences back to epochs in the 
depths of primeval antiquity in the history of our 
planet, during which long-continued dynasties of 
animal and vegetable life maintained their sway 
under circumstances more or less different from any 
which prevail now, yet in all cases evincing the 
unbroken continuance of the same analogies in the 
structure and instincts of the animals, and in the 
regular operation of the same physical laws in con« 
fonnity with which the changes were brought about. 
Instances occur where a mountain mass beai:8 
evident marks of having been forced up from be- 
neath, while, resting on its base, the strata of the 
plain (of a different kind of rock,) are observed per» 
fecUy horizontal and undisturbed. No one who it

disposed to consider tlie subject in a rational way 
can doubt that these undisturbed strata were de- 
posited after the upheaving of the mountains. 

Again, in certain other mountains, a different set 
of appearances present themselves; patches of 
superficial strata, the same as those of the valley, 
are found resting on the elevated parts; and the 
strata of the valley also disturbed from their hori« 
zontal position, tilted up and inclined against the 
sides of the mountain. No reasonable doubt can 
be entertained that these were deposited before the 
upheaving of the mountains ; and were carried up 
by the same action which elevated them. . 

Comhinatiom of Inductions. 

The force of inductive conclusions, guided by wide 
analogies, is often immensely increased by the combi- 
nation, and converging to a common point, of several 
different trains of investigation, setting out from 
entirely distinct and remote origins ; yet all ulti- 
mately, and often very unexpectedly, brought to 
bear on the same conclusion. 

Thus Dugald Stewart* had acutely observed, 
^ The uniformity of animal instinct presupposes a 
corresponding regularity in the physical laws of the 
universe, insomuch that if the established order of 
the material world were to be essentially disturbed, 
(the instincts of the brutes remaining the same,) all 
their various tribes would inevitably perish.** lilr. 







THE INDUCTIVE METHOD. 47 

Lyell extends this inference in a remarkable manner 
to the condition of the globe at a remote period. 

" Any naturalist,** (he observes,) ** will be con- 
vinced, on slight reflection, of the justice of this 
remark. He will also admit that the same speciei 
have always retained the same instincts, and there- 
fore that all the strata wherein any of tlieir remains 
occur must have been formed when the phenomena 
of inanimate matter were the same as they are in 
the actual condition of the earth. The same con- 
clusion must also be extended to the extinct animals 
with which the remains of these living species are 
associated ; and by these means we are enabled to 
establish the permanence of the existing physical 
laws throughout the whole period when the tertiary 
deposits were formed *.** 

Geology, indeed, is full of striking examples of 
such combined inductions. It calls to its aid the 
separate resources of many distinct branches of phy- 
sical inquiry, and from their united testimony, col- 
lects the materials of its conclusions. 

Thus the naturalist traces not only the invariable 
characteristics of species, but also the peculiarities 
which mark the adaptation of species to climate; 
he finds the characteristics belonging to a vrann 
climate in the fossil remains which the geologist 
submits to his examinatioiL

ness in the form of the earth's orbit, to be that of a 
diminution (however slight,) in the mean tempera- 
ture arising from the supply of heat from the sun. 

While the physical philosopher aigues on the 
theoiy of central heat for the primitive high tem« 
perature of the globe, the meteorological geogra- 
pher finds in the peculiar distribution of land and 
water on the earth's surface, a pow*erful agent in 
modifying climate. The geologist infers from une- 
quivocal proo£i that such changes in the distribution 
of sea and land have actually occurred. And by 
successive local operations, extensive and ultimately 
perhaps universal alterations have been accomplished 
in the relative position of the oceans and continents. 
Such effects have gone on in former periods by de- 
positions and inroads, by elevations and subsidences^ 
as they are still continuing to do. 

How vastly does the mutually-conspiring testi- 
mony of these veiy different trains of research tend 
to increase the force of the inductive inference that 
the fossil animals and plants alluded to existed at 
incalculably remote periods, when the present land 
was the bed of the ocean, and when the surface of 
our planet enjoyed a higher temperature than at 
present, and tliat from the changes of temperature 
and local conditions, causes were brought into 
action, which occasioned the extinction of some 
species, and were favourable to the introduction of 
others of new Idnds.

Caution in assuming Analogies. 

But even if in any case a particalar ' analogy should 
£Edl ; if the clue should break ; if some unexpected 
and anomalous fact should throw into confusion our 
previously imagined arrangement, still so powerful 
is the confidence inspired by what we do satisfius 
torily know of the permanence of natural order» 
that we can never really distrust the stability of 
such a foundation for our reasonings. 

If it be true that (his particular analogy is over- 
thrown, the only £ur conclusion is, that, in this case^ 
our conceptions were too hasty, not t]iat the order 
of nature is violated. The conviction that some real 
analogy subsists is in no degree weakened, because 
we may have failed as yet to light upon it. The 
certainty that there is a right path is not diminished 
because we may have taken a wrong one. . The only 
effect of such an occurrence on a truly philosophic 
mind, will be the excitement of a still more diligent 
search after those characteristic circumstances which 
may indicate the true point of comparison* 

We will illustrate this remark by a few examples : 
(1.) The earth moves from west to east; all the 
primary planets revolve in the same direction, in« 
eluding Uranus ; the same is true of our moon, and 
of those of Jupiter and Saturn, and the ring of the 
latter planet. On the discovery of the satellites of 
Uranus, would it not then have appeared hit to 
expect that they would move in the same direction I

Yet, in &ct, tliey revolve in the opposite direction. 
But why should we thus extend the inference? 
Perhaps we feel persuaded that there must be some* 
thing common in the nature of all the planetary mo- 
tions ; nor can it be denied that such an idea is very 
natural ; the only fault is, that the hypothesis is not 
comprehensive enough. Let us look at one other 
circumstance; the earth, Jupiter and Saturn have 
their satellites' orbits very nearly in the plane of the 
ecliptic. Suppose we were to affirm that those 
satellites, whose orbits are nearly in the plane of the 
ecliptic, have their motions from west to east, then 
our proposition would be completely verified; for 
the orbits of the satellites of Uranus differ from all 
the others in being almost perpendicular to the plane 
of the ecliptic. We should, therefore, now have a 
very fair ground of inductive inference in supposing 
some connexion between the inclination of the 
orbits and the direction of the motion. Again, 
there may possibly exist a relation of another kind ; 
the peculiarities of this planet may form a connect- 
ing link, as it were^ with other laws prevailing in a 
further series of planets beyond it ; or if it be the 
last, in other systems beyond ours. From such 
instances as this we learn no disparagement to the 
uniformity of nature, though much caution in form- 
ing our coiyectures as to its character ; no distrust 
of the existence of order and arrangement, but only 
the necesdty for a just ground of probabili^ in 
tracing them*

(2.) We may addaee as another instance, the case 
which has been fully stated, and turned to such im« 
portant purposes of argument, by Mr. Babbage*» 
derived from his own calculating engine. Con- 
sidered here merefy with reference to our pre^eni 
subject^ it is perhaps one of the most remarkable 
illustrations which could be selected of the neces- 
sity of caution, and the most extended range of 
induction, before we can satisfactorily establish the 
absolute generality of any conclusion. 

The case is briefly this : the machine being set in 
a particular manner, will go on producing the series 
of natural numbers^ ], 2, 3, 4, &c., and this may be 
carried to several thousands; from induction the 
observer might then infer that it would go on for as 
many thousands more. It in fact continues up to 
100,000,000; the same induction would seem to 
render it next to certain that the series would be 
continued ; it produces 100,000,001 ; but the next 
term, instead of being 100,000,002, will, in fact, be 
100,010,002. Here we might infer analogy is 
entirely broken, and there is an end of all confidence 
in induction. But when the calculation is continued 
it is found that now a new but still perfectly regular 
law of a different kind begins to prevail. Again, at 
a further extremely remote period, this ceases, and 
another law commences; and these all connected 
by another rule; and so on without limit. The 
fitult then was simply that our first induction was

too limited ; not that there was a failure in the real 
law. 

(3.) To take another example: — ^Newton made 
observations on the rate at which hot bodies cool, 
and found a simple law to express how the rapidity 
changes as the time elapses. This was deduced by 
induction : but it did not extend beyond a certain 
range of temperature. Later observers went to 
higher temperatures, and found the law fail. Was 
this then any disparagement to the real existence of 
same analogy, or same determinate law ? This ques- 
tion would receive but one answer from all who 
knew anything of physical reasoning; and that 
answer Avas speedily confirmed by the researches of 
Dulong and Petit, who established a more compre- 
hensive law, applying accurately to all cases ; and 
which, for lower temperatures, resolved itself into 
the simpler law, before found by Newton. 

(4.) Pliilosophers have been for the last century 
sedulously engaged in collecting observations on the 
direction, intensity, and variation of terrestrial mag- 
netism. Various attempts have been made to frame 
some sort of theoiy to represent its laws, but none 
hitherto with more than very partial success. But 
are we^ therefore^ to infer that there really exists no 
fixed law, or regular cause of the phenomena? It 
is only a guiding principle of probability deduced 
by comparison with some corresponding class of 
effects, which is wanting. Now the later dis- 
coveries of electro-magnetism suggest the analogy

of a series of currents^ and the idea of the globe as a 
vast eleetro-magnetic, or rather, perhaps, thermo- 
magnetic, combination: which, again, is rendered 
extremely probable by the known metallic nature of 
its materials. Some theoiy of this kind is most 
likely to supply the clue which will ultimately con« 
duct us to a systematic view of this curious subject. 
(5.) To take one more instance : The extraordinaij 
parallelism which subsists between the phenomena 
of light and sound has led to a theoiy for explaining 
the most perplexed and intricate results disclosed by 
optical experiments. 

Two pipes, pitched a little out of unison, sounded 
together, produce, not a double sound, but beats^ 
that is, alternations of sound and silence. Two 
streams of light, almost coinciding in direction, 
produce, not a double light, but stripes^ that is» 
alternations of light and darkness. 

Several distinguished philosophers had each pro- 
posed theories, which well explained some portion of 
the phenomena of physical optics. But it was not 
until the above analogy occurred to Dr. Toung» that 
a general explanation was supplied, which he named 
the principle of interference. This doctrine, how- 
ever, is only a branch and consequence of the more 
comprehensive theory of undulations, which, in the 
hands of Fresnel, Cauchy, and others, has now 
afforded the perfect explanation of nearly all the 
most complicated phenomena of lights which obser- 
vation has presented.

There are, however, some phenomena which this 
theory does not perfectly account for. The absorption 
of cert^n of the primary rays, and not of others, by 
different transparent media, presents results of the 
most varied and apparently irregular kind. For a 
long time they were considered to defy all attempts 
at theoretical explanation. But even here a remark- 
ably instructive instance of the value of philosophical 
analogy occurred. Sir J. Herschel brought argu- 
ments from such analogies alone, to bear on the 
question with the greatest effect ; and by a striking 
reference to a parallel case in the doctrine of sound, 
(which is perfectly explained by the theory of 
vibrations of the air as the cause of sound,) he 
demonstrated^ not that the undulatory theory explains 
the phenomena of absorption of light, but that those 
phenomena, however unexplained, constitute no 
valid objection against its truth. The paper*, inde- 
pendently of its physical interest, is well worthy of 
being studied by the intellectual philosopher. And, 
further, a very recent investigation by Baron Von 
Wrede, has at least shown that the analytical prose- 
cution of the idea thus suggested gives a mathema- 
tical explanation of the general fact: though its 
precise laws have not yet been determined so as to 
afford data for any application of the test of nume- 
rical calculationf.

Rejection of Pi^ncipUs foreign to Analogy. 

Of this, however, vre may be most certainly con- 
vinced, that althougli, in any particular instance^ we 
may fail in tracing out the real connexion of natural 
causes by this or that assumed analogy, which may 
in itself appear very conformable to probability, we 
shall assuredly never succeed by adopting any hypo- 
thesis which is independent of natural analo^es, or 
foreign to them ; we shall never arrive at any satis- 
factory explanation of nature, or any real philoso- 
phical truth, by having recourse to other principles 
ALIEN from those of induction. Nature must always 
be her own interpreter. 

If we adopt hypotheses for example built upon 
metaphysical or moral considerations, we may be 
certain they will never conduct us to physical truth. 
Whatever may be their merits in themselves, and 
when directed to their proper purposes, they are 
totally misapplied in physical subjects : or rather, it 
must be from an entire misapprehension of the 
nature and objects of physical researches, that we 
shall ever be induced to connect them with such 
speculations.

hypotheses, often framed in utter defiance of all 
principles of analogy. But a more just and rational 
method has since begun to prevail ; a method which 
(whatever difference of opinion may exist on some 
points of detail) must be recognised by all philosophic 
inquirers, as sound in its principle^ viz., that of rea- 
soning cautiously on the fiu!ts, from the hiawn to the 
unknown^ 6y the guidance of rationally adopted anaUh 
gie$. Speculations, which, in accordance with some 
formerly received views, once passed current for 
sound geology, were really such as altogether to 
discredit the uniformity of natural causes. But the 
more closely we adhere to sober and legitimate 
induction, the more will every discovery indicate the 
unbroken uniformity of plan, which has prevailed 
through the immeasurable periods of past stages of 
organized life. '* If," says Mr. Lyell, ^ instead of 
inverting the natural order of inquiry, we cautiously 
proceed in our investigations, from the known to 
the unknovm, and begin by studying the most 
modem periods of the earth's history, attempting 
afterwards to decipher the monuments of more 
ancient changes, we can never so hx lose sight of 
analogy as to suspect that we have arrived at a new 
system, governed by different physical laws*." 

The necessity of proceeding on such principles, to 
the utter rejection of all gratuitous suppositions^ or 
cherished prejudices, is now becoming more generally 
•i^cknowledged : the grand conclusions deduced are

independent of all disputed theoretical questions; 
and are now admitted by rational geologists of all 
schools. 

The evidence of facts b undeniable as to all the 
main features of the process by which the surface of 
our planet was gradually brought into its present 
condition. The business of inductive geology is to 
compare the monuments of early changes in the 
earih*s surface with those now in the course of pro- 
gress : and that this is a sound principle to proceed 
upon is assured to us by the circumstance^ that in 
the succession of these changes we meet with no 
interruption: we witness such effects locally and 
gradually going on at the present day : we trace by 
diligent observation the evidences of their having 
gone on in the same manner (whether or not upon a 
larger scale) in ages earlier than the records of his- 
tory : in the deposits characterized by the remains 
of organized beings of the same species as those now 
inhabiting the earth: in the earlier beds» where 
existing species are mixed with extinct: until we 
arrive in succession at those containing none of the 
former and all of the latter class. The continuance 
of the same set of appearances is tmbroken from the 
present time, through those comparatively recent 
deposits, up to those of older formation. And 
though the authority of Guvier was once appealed 
to as having inferred from the alternations in the 
tertiary formations of the Paris basin, that here there 
were interruptions of order, from causes not apparent,

and that ** the thread of induction was broken,** yet 
the later researches of Lyell and others have 
explained those apparent breaches of continuity in 
the series, and the investigation of those tertiary 
beds, in all their varieties of organic characteristics^ 
has now become the principal source of evidence by 
which geologists have fully established the unbroken 
series, the uninterrupted continuity of these forma- 
tions, in relation with the existing organized products 
of the neighbouring seas, and the operations of now 
existing laws. And whatever may have been the 
magnitude of some of the operations in remote 
epochs, yet we find no deviation from the continu- 
ance of action of the same kind ; no real suspension 
of regular la^vs, no simultaneous universal destruc- 
tion and reconstruction of the globe ; but through 
the whole range of those periods of which we can 
decipher the monuments, we have continued evi- 
dence of the same system of gradual changes by 
which the existing state of things was, by slow 
degrees, evolved out of previous orders of existence. 
Such must be the genet-al view of the matter (what- 
ever difference may subsist on minor points,) wliich 
will be upheld by the inductive geologist in contra- 
distinction to the dogmatical assertions of the cos- 
mogonist. The chimerical, yet fiivourite notion, of a 
sudden total change^ of a catastrophe by which one 
world was suddenly reduced to chaos, and another 
as suddenly called forth out of its ruins, during any 
of the periods the records of which we read in their

existing organic remains, is not only wholly inad- 
missible, inasmuch as it must be derived altogether 
from considerations alien to those of physical ana- 
logj, but is absolutely contradicted by all inductive 
testimony. 

We find no period since the very commencement 
of all those depositions which contain organic re- 
mains, at which some portion of the earth's surfooe 
was not abundantly peopled with an animal and 
vegetable creation, more or less different indeed 
from that now existing, but in all respects preserving 
an exact uniformity of plan and design, and pre- 
cisely and admirably fitted for the kind of existence 
which accorded with the then condition of the globe ; 
but destined gradually to disappear as those con- 
ditions were changed, and as other and varied forms 
of existence were in succession introduced. The 
total absence of all marks of any universal sudden 
overwhelming convulsion, supplies positive proof 
that nothing of the kind took place within any of 
those periods, the monuments of whose duration 
we find in the accumulated remains of successive 
formations ; especially during any of the later 
epochs, and least of all subsequently to the latest 
tertiary deposits, that is, within those times which 
can alone possibly accord with the received chrono- 
logy of the human species^ and with the sera of 
those changes which brought the globe into a state 
suited to the residence of man.

luductive Character of Geologtf. 

In the illustrations above given, I have enlarged on 
those selected from geology in particular, ivith refer- 
ence to objections often brought against that branch, 
as if it were of a less strictly inductive character 
than others. This, I conceive, is an idea which 
must totally vanish before the slightest real exami- 
nation of the nature of the reasoning employed by 
any sound geologists; though it may be freely 
admitted that most extravagant speculations have 
occasionally been obtruded on the world under the 
name of geological theories. Yet these, the moment 
they are critically examined, are found to be defec- 
tive, not merely in their details, but in the assump- 
tion of their first principles, and the very method 
by which the investigations are conducted. Among 
sound and rational geologists, whatever diflerence 
may exist as to certain theoretical views, none what- 
ever can subsist as to the sole recognition of strict 
inductive reasoning, and the utter rejection of all 
other authority, on which to rest their conclusions. 

Some persons have indeed been uigent in denying 
to geology the claim to be ranked among the esaet 
sciences, and have appealed to the authority of 
great names in support of their assertion, having aU

the while a very confused idea of the meaning of an 
^ esact ^ science ; and imagining that when it has 
been refused this title, it was meant to withhold 
from it the character of substantial physical truth 
and inductiye certainty. Whereas it is eyident to 
those who are but moderately conversant with the 
current scientific language of the day, that the 
phrase ^ exact science" has been used solely as 
designating those branches of physical inquiry which 
could be brought under the dominion of tnathema-^ 
tied laws, and whose results could be exhibited in a 
numerical form, and compared with theory by arith- 
metical computation. In this sense undoubtedly 
geology has not yet become one of the ^ exacf^ 
sciences ; though from the nature of some recent 
researches* on the effects of mechanical forces such 
as may be supposed to have acted in the elevations 
of the various parts of the earth*s crust, it would 
seem to be fast approaching to the condition even of 
this class of investigations. But, at any rate^ this 
is quite independent of its claim to be received as 
among the most incontrovertible of those systems 
of inductive truth which have not as yet been of a 
nature to receive the aid of mathematical demon- 
stration.

Objections to Geology. 

I HAVE felt it desirable to dwell the more particu- 
larlj on the stnctly indudite character of geology^ 
not only on general grounds, but more especially 
because much pdns and some ingenuity have been 
employed to disparage and even deny the evidence 
of this science*. To some such objections wo have 
already referred ; and the rest arc not more rational 
or more consistent. When refuted on other grounds^ 
their upholders take refuge in the convenient maxim, 
that after all, geology is but in its infimcy, and as 
many theories once adopted have now been rejectedt 
80 those now in vogue may be in their turn exploded : 
or again, they contend that the utmost extent of our 
researches lias not penetrated beyond the mere crust 
of the earth, — ^how then can we pretend to draw 
such general conclusions ! 

If the science be in its infancy, we can only 
say that it has displayed such vigour as already 
to have grappled with and overcome the most 
formidable attacks. False theories have indeed 
been exploded; but the order of advance has 
been regular and systematic ;. the early cosmogonical 
speculations have indeed been discarded, for the 
simple reason that they were not founded on induc- 
tion, but on some foreign principle or authority, and 
therefore had no substantial or enduriug consistency. 
A remnant of the same spirit, however, continued

to linger about the schools of geology, and displayed 
itself in later times in the diluvial hypothesis, and 
others of the same nature. These, in their various 
modifications, have since g^ven way, and for the 
very same reason, because their foundation was 
defective ; it was based on some oilier authority than 
that of simple induction. So the belief in vast and 
sudden revolutions in the state of the entire globe 
has been discarded; the inductive principle is 
extending its triumphs, and if all the phenomena 
presented by the observed state of the earth's sur- 
face have not been actually explained by the action 
of known causes, yet many have been which were 
before not perceived to be capable of such explana- 
tion; and it has become generally admitted that 
this is the only sound method to be pursued in the 
endeavopr to throw any real light upon them. 

In this way, and in this steady course of advance 
from the hypothetical to the matter-of-fact, may 
geological theories come to be successively modified, 
but in no other. Those who make this a topic of 
objection must, therefore, prepare themselves to 
expect, in the changes they may anticipate, nothing 
fitvourable to any preconceived hypotheses, but eveiy 
thing tending still more and more to take a direc- 
tion entirely opposed to those fiivourite schemes of 
cosmogony which have usually prompted these and 
the like objections. 

And if, as the objectors urge, we have penetrated 
as yet only a thin film, as it were, of the mere out-

ward crust of the earth, how completely does the 
obYious inference recoil on themselves ! If bj going 
only to this trifling extent, we have succeeded in 
obtaining such a mass of evidence, and substantiating 
such vast and overpowering conclusions^ what may 
not result when our inquiries shall be able to 
penetrate still deeper? 

The introduction of imaginary systems of cosmo- 
gony into geology, is but an exemplification of the 
same fidlacious principles of speculation, by which 
eveiy branch of physical inquiiy has^ in its turn, 
been impeded and perverted. It was in the same 
spirit that Kepler believed the globe to be a living 
animal : that Tycho Brahe feigned the sun with his 
attendant planets to revolve round the earth : and 
that the equilibrium of the mercury in the baro- 
meter, was ascribed by Linus to a suspension by 
invisible threads. 

Fd^e Phiiosophtf from neglect of Analogy. 

The same want of inductive principles^ the same 
spirit of gratuitous theorizing, which prevailed in the 
disputations of the schoolmen, characterized in no 
less degree the speculations of Descartes and his 
followers, which in a later age took their place. 
The main error which pervaded the whole system of 
that eminent philosopher, was the adoption of a 
metaphysical basi$9 on which to rear the edifice of 
phyHcal truUi. Or, in a word, the introduction of

From the influence of the same canse^ even in 
comparatiTely modem times, it • required ai^^ long 
struggle to divest chemistry of that chimerical iheoiy 
of combustion, whose advocates imagined ^phlo- 
giston," — a sort of metaphysical something^ tbey 
knew not what, which conferred on bodies tbe 
property of being combustible^ and was abstracted 
during the process. 

In this recurrence to principles alien firom those 
of induction, we find the radical defect common to 
the ancient as well as the modem scholastic theories. 
This was the fundamental mistake whicb vitiated 
alike the system of the peripatetics and the Hutchin- 
sonians ; which upheld the crystalline spheres and 
the a^therial vortices — ^the starry influences and the 
diluvial cataclysms ; the cosmogonists* chaos and the 
philosophers' stone. « 

It was to guard against such erroneous modes of 
speculation, that Bacon, in bis Novum Ofyamm, 
dwelt so earnestly on the principal sources of error 
which had arisen, or were likely to arisen in philoso- 
phical speculation, from the neglect of those just 
rules and principles. The several chief causes of 
mistake^ which lead men into unsubstantial and 
delusive theories, classified under their respectiva 
beads^ are what he designates in hia somewhat

but abundantly expressive, language, by the 
name of ^ Idola," the false divinities which the mind 
is apt to raise as the objects of its adoration, when 
it ought to be engaged in the sole worship of 
trnth. 

It is £Eur from my design here to enter into any 
discussion of those sources of fiilse philosophy. The 
excellence of Bacon's suggestions, as well as their 
importance^ not merely for the guidance of the 
philosophical inquirers of his day, but as involving 
the correction of mistaken ideas, likely to be perpe- 
tually recurring, will be recognised by all who have 
examined his immortal work : and it will be the less 
necessary for me to insist on them here, since I have 
elsewhere placed them in a light accessible to the 
general reader*. 

I will merely remark here, that the class termed 
** Idola theatri,** seems to include the chief source of 
error to which I am here more esi)ecially referring : 
the adoption of artificial systems, founded on an 
assumption either of fallacious physical principles, or 
of any whatsoever not physical : the former being 
essentiaUy false, the latter, however good in their 
own way, utterly inapplicable to the purposes of 
phydcal inquiry.

Objections to Physical Inquiries. 

It is from such an erroneous assumption of first 
principles that most of the prejudices and miscon- 
ceptions against sound physical conclusions take 
their origin. Hence originates the chaige of pre- 
sumjition in scientific inquiries ; hence the accusation 
of arrogance brought against the deductions of the 
physical inquirer, especially if they happen to stand 
in opposition to the preconceived notions and che- 
rished prejudices of mankind, which are in reality 
far more presumptuous; hence the exclamations 
against the '' pride of science/' and the hostility felt 
against certain branches of inductive knowledge; 
while the objector is wholly blind to his own incon- 
sistency in nevertheless accepting and adopting the 
conclusions of other departments, which are yet 
built on the very same kind of evidence. 

This has been especially the case "with geology. 
From ill-informed, or, too oflen, prejudiced persons^ 
we hear frequent remarks disparaging the inquiries 
and conclusions of the geologist, while they allow 
and applaud the inferences of the astronomer and 
the chemist; they condemn as visionary and pre- 
sumptuous the results of the one as to the antiquity 
of strata, and the successive o^ras of animal organisa- 
tion, the monuments of which are before their eye% 
while they revere as unquestionable truths the most 
marvellous and paradoxical inferences of the other : 
which refer to subjects utterly beyond the scope of

the senses, to periods and distances which transcend 
our arithmetical i>ower8 to conceive, and to processes 
of nature which exceed our faculties to apprehend. 

The mathematician in his study puts down a few 
characters and figures on paper, and then confidently 
announces that the matter of which Jupiter is com- 
posed, weighs somewhat more than one-fifth of the 
average weight of the materials of the earth : and 
that of the sun about one-fourth. 

The chemist asserts that a bell glass, which 
appears empty, is, in fiict, filled with a peculiar aerial 
compound ; and invisible and impalpable as it may 
seem, yet is really formed of a vast collection of 
solid indestructible atoms ; and these of more than 
one kind, aggregated together by the most perfectly 
regular laws : and not only so^ but he actually states 
the numerical ratio in which they are so combined, 
and what is more, assigns the weights of these ulti- 
mate molecules, which no microscope can ever detect, 
no balance verify: such conclusions, however, are 
universally accepted, and popularly held forth as 
among the most certain truths of science. 

Yet when the geologist contends that the crust of 
the earth, with its organized productions, has been 
gradually brought into its present condition by a 
series of creative changes, going on through millions 
of ages, his conclusion is condemned as chimerical 
and dangmms.

hesitation, the most inconceivable assertions of the 
astronomer and optician : thej allow the full claims 
of the powers of the human mind to assign spaces 
and periods which transcend the flights of the loftiest 
imagination; to Halley*s comet an elliptic orbit 
whose long diameter is 3,420,000,000 miles, with a 
period of 75 years ; and to a molecule of aether, in a 
polarized ray traversing a quartz crystal, an elliptie 
orbit whose long diameter may be about one-5000th 
of an inch, with a period of about one-500,000,000^ 
000,000,000th of a second ; yet they talk of the arro- 
gance of the geologist in pretending to maintain 
that millions of years ago the world was going on^ 
governed by the same physical laws which prevail 
now, and replete with vegetable and animal life in 
all its varied forms of perfection and adaptation to a 
state of things, of which the existing order is only 
one of a series of gradual and regular changes. 

The true answer to such objections is found in 
the question. What sort of reasoning will you adopt 
and allow in any such inquiries? Upon this the 
whole depends. Will you be satisfied with the 
same sort of evidence as that on which we ground 
any one of the best established laws of physical 
truth ? Or will you contend that each branch of 
science is to be established on diiferent arbitrary 
principles from the others ? The very essence of all 
truly philosophic inquiry is to proceed throughout 
on one common principle of comparison and analogy, 
to advance from individual facts to classes of fitct%

Bj this mutual confirmatiou of concurring trains 
of investigation, the evidence of each is enlianced 
in a continually increasing ratio. The connexion 
between whole classes of facts bj such analo^e% 
augments to an incalculable degree an assurance of 
their truth ; and wo advance with a confidence equal 
to that inspired by demonstration, to many of the 
most apparently remote conclusions of science : yet 
with a force of evidence which legitimately demands 
the abandonment of preconceived notions^ and the 
surrender of long-cherished prejudices, if at variance 
^vith those conclusions. This advance and progres- 
sion from one train of analogy to another is, in fact, 
the main characteristic which has distinguished the 
science of the moderns from that of the ancients. 
It is this increasing and accumulating evidence of 
uniformity thrbtighout nature, which has been the 
main cause of the rapid and sure progress of modem 
science. It has been from following, under the 
guidance of such principles, the humble and unpre- 
tending path of induction, that all its most sublime 
inferences have been established. 

I have dwelt more particularly on these topics^ 
because they seem to be too much overlooked by 
those who take upon them to disparage the con- 
clusions of some branches of physical philosophy ; 
and it becomes peculiarly necessary to uige upon 
their consideration that the evidence is of one and 
the same kind in all branches : a whole science must 
not be objected to because it relies solely upon such

inductive proofs as it has been our object to explun, 
and utterly discards and disowns all other authority. 
If the foundations of one science are to be so assailed, 
all the others must be involved : all the branches of 
physical inquiry must stand or &I1 together on the 
common ground of their inductive evidence. If the 
conclusions of the geologist are in principle and 
method fidlacious, those of the astronomer and the 
chemist must be rejected on the same ground. If 
causes assigned in conformity to the entire series of 
natural analogies are to be rejected in one case^ the 
whole principle^ method, and system of reasoning on 
such analogies must be given up.

Introduction. 

In the foregoing discussion, we have endeavoiired to 
trace and analyse the nature of our conviction of 
the truth and regularity of the laws which prevail 
in the material world. We have noticed the natural 
tendency of our minds to generalize ; the intuitive 
belief in the permanence and uniformity of physical 
laws; and the immense force of evidence with 
which analogy addresses itself to our conceptions. 
These intellectual phenomena harmonise most acco- 
rately with what we find by every experimental

confirmation to be the actual state of things in the 
external order of nature. And the certainty with 
which we thus rclj on the invariable truth of sound 
physical research arises from such a combination of 
concurrent testimony as to possess a force wholly 
irresistible even to the most sceptical, and full of 
the most sublime satisfietction to every well-ordered 
mind. 

By the establishment of correct trains of analogy, 
the inductive philosopher connects the near and the 
remote, the minute and the immense, the present, 
the past, and the future. He argues from the laws 
of motion on the surface of the earth to those 
which prevail in the most distant regions of the 
heavens. He reasons from the forces which act 
between the minutest molecules, to those which 
connect sidereal systems. He extends his deduc- 
tions from spaces subject to measurement under his 
hands to the most inconceivably remote distances ; 
from o^ras of human date to the immensity of past 
duration. He advances from causes which he can 
put in operation, to those which affect the most 
immense masses ; from action in sensible space and 
time, to that which belongs to molecules and pe- 
riods of absolutely unimaginable minuteness ; from 
changes now in progress, he infers those of past 
epochs ; and from the work of actual alterations on 
the earth's surfiice computes the succession of those 
of which he traces the existing monuments. In 
the midst of the apparent irregularities of the

planetary system, he traces order, and in its per- 
petual fluctuations the principle of stability and 
security. 

Physical analogies are not only allowable helps to 
the interpretation of nature, but they are the sole 
legitimate guides. The philosopher is not merely 
at liberty to adopt them as convenient aids, but he 
is driven by the necessity of the case to follow 
them. He has no other means of ever arriving at 
an acquaintance with the scheme of natural causes. 
Their reality alone constitutes what we mean by 
such order. It is the uniformity actually found in 
certain limited portions of nature which leads to the 
presumption of its uni%*ersality. But it is under 
the guidance of that presumption that every step of 
physical inquiry proceeds : and the universal confir- 
mation of it is the general conclusion of all our 
researches. And the further sound induction ex« 
tends, the more does every fresh inference add force 
to the claims of some high principle of order to be 
recognised as pervading all nature. That induction 
can go on satisfactorily and successfully in eveiy 
new region of inquiry which may be oi)ened to it, is 
of itself a proof of the permanence and universality 
of such order and qrstem. 

Upon the foregoing considerations we may, per- 
haps, more correctly appreciate the standard of evi- 
dence to which sound physical philosophy appeals ; 
and the importance of a dear perception of real 
physical analogies in the study of it We haveb

however, already remarked at once the difficulty of 
expliuning the weight which those analogies possess, 
yet, at the same time, the actually irresistible force 
with which they impress the mind. And if the 
evidence be thus in any degree open to difference in 
its application to different minds, what does this 
amount to but saying that inductive proof does not 
amount to demonstration; or, more correctly, is 
proof of a different kind. But at any rate if it be 
allowed that there has been no attempt to overrate 
the evidence, this will but give additional security 
to the important inferences and applications to 
which we shall advance. 

Study of Cause and Effed. 

The more special object of the preceding section 
has been to examine the nature and principles of 
the Inductive l^Iethod, the characteristic process of 
the Baconian philosophy. Now the principal aim 
and object of this system is to ascend from indi« 
vidua! phenomena to general laws; from sensible 
and visible results, up to hidden and abstract prin- 
ciples ; from the experimental evidence of sense, up 
to the abstractions of mind ; from effectif to their 



In the present instance it is proposed to carry on 
the subject by the frirther examination of the nature 
of the relation of cause and effect and thifl^ more 
especially in the first instance, with reference to the

causes which we trace iu operation in the material 
world. The evidence on which our knowledge of 
these causes depends is that afforded by induction» 
which we have already been engaged in tracing; 
and in'proceeding, as we are now about to do, to the 
more direct consideration of their nature^ we shall 
find that this discussion has not been misplaced; 
and that, in fact, in studying the evidence^ we have 
arrived at some of the most important observations 
for bringing us to the apprehension of the nature of 
physical causes. In tracing the essential grounds of 
induction^ it will be found that we have elicited 
what will be our safest guide in the inquiry into the 
principle of causation. 

From the earliest periods at which intellectual 
pursuits have attained anything like a due place in 
the estimation of mankind, a high rank has always 
been assigned to the study of the causes of things. 
Surrounded as we are by the most stupendous scene 
of natural wonders, it would indeed be surprising if 
the curiosity of man were not excited, even in an 
early stage of civilization, to learn something of the 
nature and source of those effects which he daily 
witnesses in the magnificent phenomena of the 
material world. And we accordingly find that from 
the earliest times at which the human race has been 
sufficiently advanced to give attention to such sub- 
jects, the inquiry into the nature and relations^ the 
dependence and connexion, of natural phenomena, 
has obtained at least some share of attention ; and

thougb pursued only by a few, has conferred upon 
them, at all times, a certain degree of reputation 
even among tbe uniustructed, \rliile \rith those of 
more enlightened ideas, a knowledge of the causes 
of those effects which we daily witness has been 
regarded as among the highest objects pf intellec- 
tual attainment ; and to be permitted thus to pene- 
trate, as it were, into the hidden processes by which 
nature works, has been esteemed the most elevated 
privilege of philosophy. It is a species of know- 
ledge of extreme interest and value in itself, and 
embraces in its applications, some of the most 
important and even momentous questions which can 
occupy human contemplation. 

Memwig of the tenn ^ Catue^ 

Ik order to pursue our inquiry into the nature of 
Physical Causes, it will be essential, in the first 
instance, to distinguish, as clearly as we can, the 
meaning annexed to the term. 

In common language, the term ^ cause ** is used 
with considerable latitude of meaning ; and even in 
many discussions pretending to a philosophic cha- 
racter, a slight examination will show that it bean 
several distinct kinds of signification. We are apt 
to use the tame ward, and thence imagine that we 
are speaking of the same thing, in cases which are 
essentially different; though there is doubtless 
enough of apparent resemblance to mislead inaceu*

CAUSE AKD EFFBOr. 79 

rate thinkers into the notion of identity. Hence 
the ambiguity and fiiUacy ^hich prevail in some of 
the most important inquiries connected with this 
subject ; and the manifest necessity for attention to 
accurate distinction of the meaning of terms. 

In ordinary affiiirs, we talk of the ** cause** of aa 
undertaking, or the ** cause" of our conduct 
Again \re speak of the ** cause" of an historical 
event ; and we apply the term to matters of reason- 
ing or belief in the conjunction ** because." We 
mean the motive of our actions ; the ground or €0f- 
dence of our opinion; the train of circumstances 
which brought about an event in history. In these 
and the like cases, we may trace a general analogy, 
M'hich has led to the application of the same term. 
In all of them we refer to some sort of mond in/lth' 
ence exercised either by concurrent circumstances 
upon human motives or convictions, or by human 
agency (individual or collective) upon events. 

In the discussion of causes and effects, as we 
contemplate them in the natural world, and in con- 
nexion with physical science, it is more especially 
necessary to guard against the vague use of terms. 
And in proceeding to the more precise examination 
of the nature of physical causes^ we may consider 
more particularly, as a preliminary illustration in the 
way of contrast, two fiuniliar instances of the use of 
the term ^ cause." 

We may say the cause of the motions of a watdli 
is the tendency of the main-spring to unwind itself;

and the came of the flight of the cricket-ball is the 
Toluntarj effort of the player. These are two 
instances which would seem, at first sight, closely to 
resemble each other ; but when accurately examined, 
we find an important distinction between them. In 
the former instance, we trace the order of depen« 
dence of the motions from the index to the wheels, 
from the wheels to the fusee, and so up to the ten- 
dency of the spring to unwind ; and this we refer to 
the property of elasticity ; whidi again may pos- 
sibly depend on some still higher principle in the 
nature and arrangement of the particles of which 
elastic bodies are composed. But to whatever 
extent we may advance in thus analyzing the effect 
up to its simplest elements, one thing is all along 
manifest; viz., that the very highest principle of 
any such series must essentially be some general, 
fixed, inherent, property of matter; by virtue of 
which it is capable of being influenced in particular 
ways, and by particular agents ; but yet is wholly 
inertf and incapable of arbitrarify originating any of 
the eflfects referred ta 

In the second case, we may observe, it is true^ a 
like series of effects in succession dependent one on 
another. Motion is communicated mechanically to 
the ball from the sudden action of the arm ; this 
results from the contraction of the muscles acting 
on the bones as levers; the muscular contraction 
again maybe shown to depend on some peculiar 
influence of the nerves; this again may possibly

be traced to some higher principle; we maj 
adrance, in short» as far as phjrsiological science 
can cany ns; and thus fiur, this and the former 
case are exactly alike. But here at the com* 
mencement of the whole train* there most still 
be an influence or cause of some kind different from 
any mechanical power; depending on vobmtary 
agency ; capable of originating the series of con- 
sequences from itself; acting by different laws from 
those of matter ; in a word, an agency or influence 
of a moral kind : Or (in the graphic language of Sir 
J. Herschd*), we must include ^ a distinct and 
immediate personal consciousness of causation in 
the enumeration of that sequence of events by 
which the volition of the mind is made to terminate 
in the motion of material objects ; I mean the con« 
sciousness of effort, as a thing entirely distinct from 
mere desire or volition on the one hand, and from 
mere spasmodic contraction of the muscles on the 
other.* 

Such a voluntary agency, such an influence or 
power, of which we feel conscious, and which 
implies the action (however incomprehensible,) of 
mind on matter, is what we may properly dis- 
tinguish by the term ** moral causation.** The 
former case we may call, by way of contradistinctiout 
an instance of ** physical causation.** In the study 
of causes acting in the natural worlds we must care-

taiy or moral agencj is concerned, can onlj be con« 
sidered in physical inquiry so fiur as they properly 
come under the lavrs of inert matteiv pr belong tp 
those kinds of physical action which are the subjects 
of dynamical or chemical research. To go beyopd

Observing this distinction, it wou|d ^o doubt tend 
much to. the promotion of accurate views if we 
could succeed in agreeing to disuse the term ^cause^ 
in one or other of these very distinct cases. But as 
custom has probably established the use of the term 
beyond the possibility of change, we must content 
ourselves by insisting strongly on the careful and 
constant adoption of some such distinctive appella- 
tions as those above suggested. 

We have thus far merely contended that physical 
causes are such as are widdy disthyuished from 
moral ; but we have not yet considered what their 
essential nature is : to this we now proceed. 

Nature of Physical Causes. 

In the study of physical causes there has l)een, 
doubtless, and still exists, a strong tendency to lose 
sight of the distinction just laid down; and from 
the £Euniliar notion of moral causation, tp imagine 
a similar sort of influence in the production of phy- 
sical effects : to transfer the idea of voluntaiy power

as experienced in ourselves to meclianical agents; 
and by a creation of the fancy, by a sort of personi- 
fication of the powers of nature, to invest physical, 
Trith the attributes of moral, action. But such 
indulgence of the imagination is here worse than 
idle; it has a direct tendency to confuse and 
entangle the chain of reasoning ; and this considerar 
tion becomes of more importance in reference to 
the conclusions founded on physical inquiry. On 
all grounds, then, we ought surely to keep the seardi 
into, physical truth as free as possible from such 
incongruous influence ; and soberly investigate phy- 
sical causes without being misled by the adoption of 
ideas so foreign to the subject. 

Yet notions more or less allied to these have 
been prevalent among philosophers. This pro- 
pensity for physical mysticism was pre-eminently 
fostered in the lab}Tinths of the scholastic and 
Cartesian systems of a past age. But the traces of 
it have not yet been wholly or effectually banished 
from our schools of science. 

Even in later times many philosophers have 
sought to establish the notion of what they termed 
a ** necessary connexion'* or ** efficient causation** in 
natural phenomena ; an idea which nevertheless it 
would appear very difficult distinctly to explain. 

It would seem as if they regarded material sub- 
stances as possessed of some hidden virtues or pro- 
perties, which confer on them the powers of physical 
agents; and imagined these occult qualities the

secret soul which animates, as it were^ the whole 
frame of nature. 

In some instances^ the adoption of these ideas 
may be traced to associations arising out of the 
common use of metaphorical language*. We talk 
of the chain of cause and effect ; the links of that 
chain ; the connejnon of one event with another ; the 
dependence of causes ; the production of a result from 
its cause. These metaphors being taken from mate- 
rial objects, insensibly lead many minds to suppose 
some similar, real, and effective union between the 
events. But this is nothing more than the very 
common mistake of straining a metaphor beyond 
the points of parallelism, in which it properly 
applies, to others which are wholly incidentaL Per- 
haps we might rather say these metaphors them- 
selves have been adopted and conceived upon a fidse 
train of analogy. At any rate, if we retain the use 
of them, we should be careful not to be misled by 
the phraseology we employ into ideas at variance 
with the real nature of the relation intended to be 
expressed by it 

Another source, perhaps, from which these notions 
of ^ efficient causation** have derived strength, may 
be discovered in the vague conceptions which have 
sometimes prevailed with regard to the nature of 
mechanical forces. We might instance some specu- 
on the nature of ^ inertia,** and the commu-

nication of motion ; as well as others connected 
with the questions once aj^tated req)ect]Qg the 
" vis Tiva." Or, to take a more familiar example 
the indistinct notions which freqnentljr inTolre in a 
singular degree of m^tery, the advantage obtained 
in the use of the mechanical powers. On wit- 
nesdng the effects produced bj these contiiTance^ 
the untaught mind can hardl7 help imagining a 
sort of creative energy which invests matter with 
new attributes, and supplies a source of active 
power capable of almost indeiinite increase. Sden- 
tific investigation, indeed, dispels the illusion, yet it 
often continues to haunt both our language and our 
ideas relative to the nature of causation. ' 



Opiniont on the Nature of Causation. 

Whether, however, originating in such misconcep- 
tions or not, whether pushed to a greater or leaa 
extent, some notions of this kind have prevuled 
very generally. But reasoners of an oppodte Bcho(d 
have arisen, who, aiming at a peculiar degree of 
precision and rigour in their speculations, have 
utterly denied and discarded all ideas of such active^ 
efficient influence which, they contend, is altogether 
chimerical; and have sought to reduce the wh(de 
nature, and conception of cause and eflfect to the 
bare, naked, matter-of-foct, learnt from experience 
that some one particular event or phenomenon in 
nature always invariably follows another iu order of

time ; the former being termed the effect^ the latter 
the cause ; tliat besides this mere invariable ** se^ 
qmnce** (as it is termed), they have no other kind of 
connexion or dependence one on the other ; all vre 
know or can know of the matter is the simple faety 
that such sequence does universally hold good ; aiid 
tliat we cannot reverse the order. If we be prone 
to entertain the idea of any higher or more intimate 
connexion, this, they contend, is only 2^ vague pre- 
possession, utterly inadmissible in exact philosophic 
inquiry. 

Against these views considerable objection has 
been raised; often, doubtless, from the abuse of 
them; because they were too exclusively dwelt 
upon, or pushed to unwarrantable extremes in thdr 
application. 

But apart from these objections, the generality of 
inquirers seem to have felt miable to rest satisfied 
in a view of the subject apparently so little calcn« 
iated to gratify the cra%ings of our intellectual 
curiosity, and seeming to conduct us to so little an 
extent into the secret workings of nature which we 
are so desirous to penetrate. They have generally 
yielded to the seemingly more natural but vague 
persuasion, that there is yet in the relation of cause 
and effect, some real, hidden, essential eneigy, which 
pervades, and actuates all the operations of the 
material world.'

the subject foirly, we must of course dismiss, in the

inapplicable ; some such instances are not real invar

We restrict our view of cause and effect to cases

some chemical effect or some mechanical motion is 
produced. To take one or two simple instances oi

saj ^ friction is a cause of heat :** ** the action of an 
acid is the cause of a vegetable blue turning red.** 
The ancients (ignorant of gravitation) considered 
« the moon to be the cause of the tides.** 

In such cases as these there is clearly the inva- 
riable association of one fieu^t mth another, hj a 
sequence in order of time. Tlius, whenever we rub 
two substances together, under all circumstances, the 
effect of heat follows ; and in greater intensity as the 
friction is more violent : it depends on this and on 
this alone. In the strict use of terms, then, in this 
and the like cases, our proposition is nothing more 
than the affirmation of this invariable relation of 
sequence, as a result of universal experience. 

In these instances, then, we have a precise exem- 
plification of the doctrine of invariable sequence 
constituting the whole nature of cause and effect. 
We observe only such an inseparable relation 
between the two fiicts. We may doubtless imagine 
some higher principle, to account for the production 
of heat in the one case, and of colour in the other^ 
as the ancients might have imagined (and, perhaps, 
did so) a sort of principle of attraction in the tides : 
but whatever we may imagine^ we know nothing. 
When these and the like cases, then, are contem- 
plated in a strictly inductive point of view, we are 
obliged to admit that nothing is actually proved 
beyond the invariable ** sequence.**

Causes referred to General Laws : Ejvmples. 

A DiFFEBENCE zoaj, pcrhaps, be traced between such 
instances as these last referred to, and some others 
which we may adduce. For instance, when we saj 
that ** pulsations of air are the cause of sound.** it 
will be immediately felt that some relation, of a kind 
more satis&ctory to our minds, is here afSrmed.tban 
in the former cases. There is manifestly an inTariahle 
sequence; whenever this sort of pulsation is pro- 
duced, sound inrariably follows, and never without it. 

But besides this, the propa^tion of tremnloua 
waves, or pulsations, through the air is a mechanical 
effect, of which we form a general idea apart from 
its influence on our organs ; and we refer the vibn^ 
tions produced in the membranes of our ears, and 
the sensation which ensues, as a particular case, to 
the more general fact of pulsations of elastic media. 
Here, then, there is not o»^the sequence of one ftot 
upon another, but, also^ the former is inore ooa^re- 
heiuite, and includes the latter as a particular case 
of a more general class of phenomena. 

In the same manner, wo saj that rapid chemtaU 
combination is the cause of that evolution of heat and 
light which we call con^ustion. 

Her^ ag^n, we refer the particular effbct to a 
cause of a taore compreltetuive kind : what we mean 
to affirm is, that combustion is a peculiarly r^d and 
intense ^pedes of chemical combination. Agaii^

vrhich the ancients perceived between the moon and 
the tides, to that view of the case which is now 
afforded us by the doctrine of universal gravitation, 
acting between the sun, the moon, the solid earthy 
and the waters on its surfiice, we arrive at a far niore 
generalized sort^of relation ; we refer the phenomenon 
not only to an invariablo seqitence^ but asseirt the 
dependence of a particular eflfect upon a very ^enteral 
principle : we mean that the tides are a particular 
case of the universal law of gravitation. 

The same may be said of our assertion, that ^ elec^ 
trie discharge is the cause of lightning and thunder ;** 
that ^ volcanic action is the cause of earthquakes ;** 
in a vast number of such instances, what we really 
mean will be found to include a reference to a more 
general &ct, law, or principle. We niean, that 
lightnhig and thunder are a paiiicuhr case of electric 
discharge ; or are reducible to that greatet* principle : 
an earthquake k particular case of the effect of volcanic 
force : that is, in all such cases, we use the term 
cause to include the idea that the one phenomenon 
(which we call the effect) is a particular kifid of the 
other (or cause) which is the more general fact : the 
relation is not only that of sequence, but also that of 
a species referred to its genus. 

When the suspension of water in the pump was

was apparently a case " buI generis :" the efifect was^ 
perhaps, soon seen to be of the same kind as the 
sus|}ension of a stone hj contact with the under sidia 
of a wet leather; there was then one step tsikea in 
the process of generalization, bj referring both to 
one common cause, still named suction. Further, the 
discovery of Torricclli referred the former case to the 
pressure of the atmosphere ; and this was soon seen 
to include the exphination of the latter and all other 
analogous phenomena. And, finally, this was redncbd 
under the still more comprchenare law of universal 
gravitation. Thus the gross and heavy matter of the 
earth (as the scholastic systems considered it), aiid the 
pure and ethereal substance of the atmosphere, were 
brought under the common dominion of one simple 
and general law. Tlius the study of causes proceeds 
from the Brst oxlmission of a peculiar phenomenoil 
as a thing "sui generis," until it is shown to be 
reducible to a species of some inore extensiTe 
established " genus." 

When a narrow beam of solar light twsses the 
sides of a wire, or the edges of an aperture, certdd 
coloured stripes or fringes are exhibited on a tereen 
placed at some distance. These fiicts were at first 
ascribed (very justly) to a peculiar pn^>eriy of 
light ; which was termed " inflexion," or sometiihes 
** di&acUon." 

The colours of soap bubbles, or t^ose tietweeh 
two glasses pressed hard together* were ascribed by 
Newton to another peadiar property of light, by

virtue of which it has different characters altematel j» 
at successive intervals^ along the length of the 
raj. These alternations of character were termed 
"fits.- 

Some other phenomena of an analogous nature 
were^ in like manner, set down as due to properties 
of light, each entirely ^ sui generis." 

At length, however, it was shown hj Dr. Younj^ 
that the J could all be reduced to a common principle 
(or genus), named ^ interference ;** (before alluded 
tof ;) and which supposed two rays of light capable of 
cither conspiring in their effects, or neutralizing each 
other, as they coincided at similar or dissimilar points 
or periods, at alternate minute distances along their 
lengths* : and such a property was accounted for by 
the supposition of light consisting in tcaves propagated 
through an infinitely rare and elastic medium. 

When a ray was transmitted through certain 
media, or reflected at a certain angle, it is found to 
have different properties alon^ its opposite sides. This 
was a distinct fisM^t, and was referred to a peculiar 
cause, termed ^ polarization." 

When polarized light is received through a tom^ 
maline (or other analyzing apparatus) in a particular 
position, it wholly disappears. But if a plate of cer- 
tain crystals be interposed, a portion of the light, or 
certain particular colours, are restored. This^ agaiot 
was considered at first a distinct property, and was

called '' (fqpolarizatiou.'' It has been, however, sinee 
perfectly explabied by the general principle of ^ inter- 
ference," if cojnbined with an explanation of polariza- 
tion, which is also easily supplied by referring it to 
the same general theory of waves. 

The cooling of the earth at night is the cause of 
the deposition of dew on those substances which 
cool fastest, from the condensation of the suspended 
moisture of the atmosphere upon them. Here the 
cooling or radiation of the earth, considered merely 
as any other heated body, is a greater or more general 
principle; such also is the more rapid cooling of 
fibrous substances ; and such, again, is the suspension 
of invisible vapour in the atmosphere, and its con- 
densation on a certain lowering of temperature. We 
are thus enabled to refer the particular instance of 
the dew on the grass (and not on the gravel) to a 
union of these more general principles. Here, theOt 
we have a combination of causes, involving a fiur 
more satisfactory and intimate kind of relation. 



True and Hypothetical Came$. 

This will be the proper place to notice an important 
distinction, often not clearly kept in view. We may 
refer to a cause, or general principle^ which is like- 
wise independently established by other experi- 
mental evidence as something actually existing in 
nature apart from the particular cases we were at 
first considering.

But also, in other cases, we may find some piere 
gratuitous supposition or hypothesis which supplies 
a connecting principle or general representation pf 
the hctSf though in itself purely fictitious. Such 
a principle is sometimes termed a ** causey" as well 
as the fonder. And such cases have been compared 
to the discoveiy of a key to a cipher, obtain^ 
merely by finding, from repeated trials^ that, in point 
of {bc^ it docs supply an interpretation. An4 some 
writers have contended that this is all we want in 
inductive philosophy, and would restrict the study 
of causes solely to this object. The illustration, 
however, at best appears to me to convey but a 
miserable idea of the investigation of physical 
causes; and if adopted exclusively, cuts off |;he 
most valuable and satisfiictory subjects of physical 
inquiry. 

Newton (at the commencement of the third book 
of his PrincipiOf) has laid down certain rules for the 
study of physical causes ; the chief of these, and a 
rule supported on the soundest considerations, points 
out two conditions as the characteristics of legiti- 
mate physical causes^ viz., that they be such as are 
^ trueT and ^ sufficient to ejcplain the phenomena.^ 

Now an hypothetical cause (or the mere key to 
the cipher,) fulfils but one of these conditions. 
Nevertheless such hypotheses may be eminently 
useful, especially when we can attain to nothing 
better. With the reference to such principle^ we 
are often compelled to be satisfied. They afford a

good representfiUon of the facta, though thcj haye 
no other existence than as so representing them. 

But on all grounds, it is a far higher and mor^ 
satisfactoiy process if ire can arrive at such a c^use 
as fulfils boik Nevton*8 conditions ; sucli as not onlj 
affords a kej to the phenomena, hut is also "¦ tru^**

a red effect ; and these classes of £Etcts are explained

The fact of interference itself is again explained

infinitely rare and elastic medium; also a vast 
nomber of other optical facts which have no con- 
nexion with interference, and others which have, are 
all capable of exact explanation by this hypothesis 
of waves; which, when modified by some peculiar 
considerations, seems likely to afford a clue to nearly 
all the most complex phenomena of light. Yet we 
have no independent proof of the existence of an

admit and call for inquiiy into the nature of the 
causes to which they can be referred. 

The pursuit of this inquiry soon discloses the 
evidence and monuments of successive changes 
which have occurred in the state of the earth's sur- 
fiice. In the attempt to trace these to their causes^ 
sound inductive geology recognises, of course^ the 
same principle of referring to those which are both 
Irue^ and sufficient to explain the phenomena. We 
cannot find true causes except in such as are really 
proved to exist, and found by experience to be in 
operation. The action of the waters on the land, 
(whether the continued power of the rivers and 
ocean, or the occasional force of inundations and 
torrents,) the subterranean foree of earthquakes, and 
the external operation of volcanoes ; the contrac- 
tions and expansions which must accompany changes 
in the temperature of any considerable thickness of 
the earth's crust : these and the like are the real 
causes to which the sound geologist refers. 

The accumulation of soil at the bottom of the 
waters, the imbedding of animal and vegetable 
remains in those depositions, the elevation of por- 
tions of land out of the sea, are operations really 
and continually going on. When, therefore^ fossil 
remains of organized beings are found imbedded in 
rocks bearing also the marks of a similar mode of 
deposition, we refer to such operations as those just 
mentioned as true causes to explain the phenomena. 
And numerous series and successions of such depo-

Ota, containing the remains of qpecies now extinct, 
and, successivelj in the order of deposition, contain- 
ing fewer of recent and more of extinct kinds, eyen 
to whole genera, dasses^ and orders of beings, call 
for the like reference to the continued action of 
similar causes through periods of countless dura- 
tion. 

And eyen if difference of opinion arise among 
geologists as to the rapidity with which such changes 
may have been effected, yet no sound inquirer refers 
to causes of different kinds; no one now dreams of 
the plastic power of nature moulding the semblances 
of oiganic remains in her sportive moods ; nor of 
the simultaneous formation of the different strata 
with all their fossils in one confused mass, from 
which they subsided at once into their present 
positions. 

The continent of Sweden is shown to have been 
slowly rising, by elevation in a mass, above the level 
of the Baltic, by a gradual, insensible movement, 
unattended by any violence or dislocation ; the effect 
of some enormous subterranean pressure. 

Here, then, is a true cause; it is also one which 
perfedfy ejrplaim tlie phenomena presented by numer- 
ous other laige districts of the earth ; which, con- 
taining immense deposits of marine shells^ must 
once have formed the bed of the sea, above which 
they are now elevated ; and exhibiting an unbroken 
level, we infer were elevated gradually, and without 
disturbance, by similar slowly-acting subterranean

forces, as true causes, and sufficient to explain the 
phenomena. 

In the tremendous earthquake which occurred on 
the coast of Chili in 1835, an eruption of a sub- 
marine Tolcano caused an enormous wave which 
swept over and entirely desolated a considerable 
tract of country. The geolo^st traces the marks of 
such sudden and violent local inundations in various 
parts of the earth at remote epochs. Here^ then, 
we have a real cause which explains theuL And i( 
in some instances, the eflfects appear to have taken 
place formerly upon a laiger scale, still we are not 
departing from the nature of a real cause in sup- 
posing submarine eruptions of greater violence. 

Thus, while no difference of opinion exists among 
rational geologists as to the propriety of attempting 
to explain the facts solely by reference to ^ true ** 
causes, questions have^ nevertheless, been, and may 
fairly be, agitated, as to the frequency or intend^ 
with which such causes may have operated in remote 
periods ; and whether we should with greater probap 
bility lean to the idea of brief eruptions of enormous 
violence, or of long-continued action of ordinaij 
energy. Such questions are clearly matter of fair 
and philosophical discussion. But the important 
point to be borne in mind is, the distinction between 
such suppositions as those, and speculations which 
would refer the effects in question to other agency 
of a different kind^ and which has not any connexion 
with the legitimate objects of inductive research.

NATURE OF PHYSICAL TRUTH. 



The questions at issue between certain geolo^cal 
schools refer only to a difference in the degree^ not 
in the kind^ of action supposecL The case is essen- 
tially distinct from any chimera of universal cata« 
strophes and convulsive paroxysms. 

Volcanic action, in a single day, has been known 
to raise a hill of some hundreds of feet in height. 
The elevation of a mountain peak of as many thou- 
sands may b^ ascribed by one geologist to the 
sudden action of volcanic eneigy a thousand times 
as great; by another, to an equal force acting 
through a thousand days. The probable reasoning 
in support of either supposition, must be made out 
from concurrent circumstances. But the important 
point is, that in either case, the theorist is not 
departing from known analogies and real causes. 
The man who should contend that the volcanic 
appearance of the mountain, together with all the 
marks of upheaving and disruption, are delusive, and 
that the whole was formed at once out of primaeval 
chaos, exactly in its present condition, would be 
fidrly divested of all claim to the title of a geologist^ 
or of a rational inquirer. 

The question respecting the explanation of geo- 
logical phenomena solely by existing causes^ seems^ 
like many other controversies, to be in a great 
degree, dependent on the meaning of tetmu. It has 
been contended that we ought to appeal as much to 
unlimitedybrce as to unlimited time. But it appears 
to me that the unlimited extension m time of the 



CAUSE AND EFFECT. 101 

operation of knovn causes is an assumption essen* 
tially distinct from tliat of an unlimited extension In 
intensity, this lost being precisely that Trhich would 
place them beyond the limits of known and real 
causes. It is undoubtedly true that we know causes 
only by their efTects, and must infer the magnitude 
of the cause from the nature of tho effects witnessed ; 
but the ver}' question is, whether we aro to derive 
this magnitude by the multiplication of the time or the 
force. And (unless where thcro is positive evidence 
of the suddcuncM of the effect from collateral circum- 
stances,) the former is the method which alone seems 
to bring us witliin the dominion of known causes. 

Again, even those theorists who have been most 
disposed to adopt the supposition of sudden and 
enormous luiroxysms of volcanic and diluvial action 
in the earlier stages of the condition of the earth, 
have never supposed them as extending over more 
tlian certun limited regions of tbo earth at one 
time. In &ct, all tho changes of which we. have 
evidence in ])ast epochs, have been manifestly kcA 
And the operation of existing causes is confined to 
a scries of the like partial and local alterations. 
Thus no sound inductive geolpg^t at the present 
day can admit anything like an universal simtdtaneow 
formation ; nor find support foi* any theory of a 
sudden cosmogony, applying at once to the entire 
sur&co of the present dry land. One small portion

the course of profoundlj-acyusted chaDges, to be 
obliterated and overwhelmed, ivhile another has been 
in progressive advance. 

In all such cases, then, the observed fact or result 
is referred as a particular case or species to some 
real existing genus or class of natural operations, 
and not left as a peculiar anomalous event, m 
generis^ or referred to arbitrary agency. 

Causes whose existence and operation is evinced 
by experience, are the ^ true** causes to which alone 
we can refer. Yet questions may fairly arise, and 
indeed must be carefully discussed, relative to the 
other condition of the case, viz., whether any par- 
ticular causes so assigned are sufficient to complain the 
phenomena ? If they are not, we then hJl back on 
the truly jihilosophical maxim so admirably laid down 
by Mr. Lyell : ^ When we are unable to explain 
the monuments of past changes, it is always more 
probaMe that the difficulty arises from our ignorance 
of all the existing agents, or all their possible effects 
in an indefinite lapse of time, than that some cause 
was formerly in operation which has ceased to act** 

Connexion of Comes. 

Thus the consideration of a ** real cause,** in fact, 
involves the connexion of one train of causes with 
another. The cause is shown to apply indepen- 
dently to one set of phenomena ; we refer another 
class to the same cause. Thus we enlaijie our ideas

of the connexion of physical phenomena ; we trace 
not onl J one series of causes and effects^ but many, 
and these not independent^ but united bj common 
principles. We perceive a union between extended 
orders of facts. We find not merely one relation 
established, but a communication opened, as it were^ 
with a vast range of such relations ; and many such 
channels of communication, widely ramifying in all 
directions. The great truths of the natural world 
are proclaimed, as it were, not merely by the accord- 
ant evidence of a few witnesses, but of a vast num- 
ber ; and with the increasing assurance, too, that as 
many more as we may summon, will all confirm 
each other's statement. And this not merely in one 
or a few points, but in connected trains of narrative ; 
and again, not only in one or a few, but a great 
number of distinct narratives, all of which throw 
light upon, and corroborate each other; and the 
number and extent of which is increasing and 
accumulating without limit 

Ideas of Efficient Causaticn. 

By such considerations as those now adducedt it 
appears to me that we obtain a view of the relati<m 
of physical cause and effect at once simple and 
satisfactory ; divested of mystery, yet rising above 
the relation of a mere invariable ^ sequenoe** of 
fects. We find the connexion of causes and eflfeeta 
in the connexion of laws and principles, And in

NATUBE OF PHYSICAL TRUTH. 



the most strictlj philosophical view of the matter, 
we rationally extend our notion of physical causation 
beyond the bare circumstance of two consecutive 
phenomena, to the conviction of an intimate union 
between them : which is no other than that of the 
particular individual case with the more general 
law : of that law with some still more comprehensive 
principle : and of this, again, in its turn, with some 
yet more universal theory: thus establishing not 
merely sequences but reasons, not merely connexions 
but explanations. 

We may thus safely admit that our persuasion of 
an intimate causality (if rationally explained) is 
really something more than the mere influence of 
an ill-regulated imagination improperly intruding 
itself upon philosophical speculation. We thus suf- 
ficiently account for the most powerful conviction of 
a hidden connexion between natural events, which 
we experience even before the grounds of it have 
been distinctly analysed. In the successively higher 
generalizations which really constitute what is so 
improperly represented by the conmion metaphor of 
the ^ chain** of causes, we find a real and rational 
gratification of our longing anxiety to penetrate 
beyond the bare surfSuse of sensible phenomena into 
the more hidden relations and mysterious combina- 
tions of nature. 

If further confirmation of this view of the matter 
be wantinj^ we may find it in observing the depend- 
ence which the strength of our impression of an

CAUSE AND EFFECT. 105 

intimate causality always has upon the extent to 
which wo trace the series of combinations of laws and 
principles. 

Tlio force of the persuasion we entertain of causar 
tion varies with the diflferent degrees in which the 
relations of physical laws are more or less general, 
more or less widely ramified and dependent one on 
another, more or less connected with high general 
principles and comprehensive theories. Our impres- 
sion of the idea of an efiicient cause is much weaker* 
for instance, in the case of friction and heat, than in 
that of gravitation and elliptic orbits, or tides. 

Suppose we should hear it reported that some 
substance had been found in which no violence of 
friction would produce heat ; in estimating its pro- 
bability prior to evidence of the fisust, I believe no 
truly philosophic inquirer would reject it as a viola- 
tion of the order of natural causes. But suppose it 
should be rumoured that a new planet was discovered, 
but that it did not move in an elliptic orbit ; I ima- 
gine this circumstance would cast suspicion on the 
credit of the whole statement, in the minds of all 
who understood the nature of gravitation. 

Or, again ; suppose it should be stated that at a 
certain port, on a certain day, the tide did not occur ; 
rather than believe that there was actually no attrac- 
tion of the water by the moon in that particular 
instance, we should adopt any supposition of cur- 
rents, winds, &c., or even rest in the mere possibili^ 
of some counteracting cause, though wholly unaUe

to assign its nature, as the more probable and 
rational idea. 

We have a far less powerful persuasion of an 
inseparable connexion between the action of an acid 
and the red colour which it produces, than of that 
between a high charge of atmospheric electricity, 
and the production of thunder. And the reason 
seems to be, that, in the former case, we know only 
the bare law that such an effect is produced : in the 
latter we know something (at least) of the reason 
why and the manner how it is produced. In the 
former we do not know any intermediate step in the 
process, any intermediate circumstance in the order 
of causes, we have no succession of generalizations : 
in the latter we can trace several. For instance : 
high electric tension always tends to a discharge : a 
sudden discharge of electricity always produces a 
flash and a violent concussion of the air : the con- 
cussion of the air always occasions a report in our 
ears. We could not imagine an instance where this 
ultimate effect was not produced without a violation 
of several distinct laws of nature. In the former case 
only one law would be violated if the effect did not 
take place. Now so firm is our persuasion of the 
uniformity of nature, that we cannot bring ourselves 
to believe in the capricious violation even of one of 
her laws; we, therefore^ are prone to regard the 
violation of several in succession^ as absolutely con- 
tradictoiy and impo88ible«

The study of physical causes has been by some 
writers disparaged and calumniated as of a low and 
confined character ; as being wholly limited to the 
bare investigation ot/ads^ and as incapable of rising 
above such knowledge as is directly conveyed by the 
senses. 

The view in which we have here contemplated iU 
will completely vindicate it from this charge. It is 
manifest, from what has been advanced, that the 
study of physical causes, even in the strictest sense^ 
involves the very highest abstractions, the exercise 
of intellectual combinations, of a nature the most 
widely remote from the evidence of sense. 

We have traced a gradation of meaning, from the 
bare laAv that one phenomenon is invariably joined 
and co-extensive with another, up to associations of 
facts and laws of successively higher generality ; we 
assign cafises of a better and more satisfactoiy nature^ 
by assigning more general theories or systems of 
truths to which the particular cases or effects are to 
be referred. 

In this point of view, then, the study of physical 
causes becomes identified %vith that of the geneni 
laws of the natural world. And it is here, therefore^ 
that the nature of causation is found to be imme- 
diately connected with that of induction^ by which 
alone those laws are elicited and established*

concerned entirely with tlie bare order of sensible 
fiu^ts : but from these it is the very object of induc- 
tion to lead him to higher principles, to guide him 
to the contemplation of the wider generalizations 
which open to him as his view enlarges, as he is 
continually rising to more elevated laws and loftier 
abstractions. 

We recur, then, to the accurate study of inducthn^ 
in order to understand the ground of a rational con- 
ception of physical catises : which is, in fiict, no other 
than that on which all sound induction proceeds : 
the extended evidence of natural analogies : the con- 
viction of a close union and conspiring harmony 
throughout the whole range of natural phenomena ; 
such that we cannot ima^^ne even a partial dissocia- 
tion which would not entail more extensive disar- 
rangements, and involve a disorganization, of the 
system of material things. 

It is the combined force of many conspiring rela- 
tions which tends to impress tiie mind with a per- 
suasion of the intimate connexion between physical 
phenomena which we call cause and effect. It is 
this support which each distinct truth ministers to 
another ; this mutual corroboration and confirmation 
of physical laws, which constitutes the notion we can 
hardly avoid forming, of a consolidating and con- 
necting power J or efficient causation, between phe- 
nomena, which maintains them in union.

which compacts the whole series of phjalcal laws, 
in a seIf-supi>orting equilibrium, like the stones of an 
arch, so that we cannot conceive the remoT&l of one 
portion without the destruction of the whole. 

We sliall thus 1>e prepared to pursue the highest 
and most important considerations which arise out 
of the philosophy of physical causes. We connect 
those causes with universal laws; we learn those 
laws from inductive evidence: and the combined 
effect of the whole body of physical induction is to 
demonstrate the immutable uniformity and recondite 
adjustment pervading all nature. And the further 
inductive generalization, or, in other words, the study 
of physical causes, may be carried, the more abun- 
dantly do we find those conclusions confirmed. The 
mutual corroboration and conspiring testimony of 
endless concurrent inductions;, advances and aug- 
ments, in an accumulating ratio the overwhelming 
evidence of order and arrangement, of analogy and 
harmony, throughout the phydcal worid.

114 BELATION OF PHYSICAL 8CIENGB 

our knowledge of physical causes must be obtained, 
it has probably been made sufficiently manifest how 
intimately the principle of inductive generalization 
is connected with all our substantial and satis&ctory 
ideas of cause and effect 

It appeared in the first instance, that a belief in 
the permanence of uniformity, and the preservation 
of analogies throughout nature^ is in &ct the veiy 
soul of the inductive philosophy. This supplies at 
once the first conjectural guide to our belief in fixed 
phyacal laws, (without which the veiy process of 
induction could not be carried on). And the 
unlimited extension of it is the grand and universal 
conclusion to which all experimental evidence leads, 
and to which all induction ministers increasing and 
abundant confirmation. In considering further our 
natural persuasion of the intimate connexion of 
physical cause and effect, I have endeavoured to 
explain it by regarding it as dependent simply upon 
the continually accumulating force of inductive 
evidence and the endless order and mutual depend- 
ence of vast series of physical laws, of successively 
higher generality and wider comprehensiveness. 

Having thus examined the nature of physical 
cansefl» the extent to which we trace their influence^ 
and the origin of our ideas of a necessaiy connexion 
or effidency in them; and having further considered 
the entirely distinct nature of what is commonly 
described by the same term '^canse^'' — but which 
ought to be carefuUy distinguished in meaning when

thus used in the sense of fuoml causation, the eflfect 
heing dependent upon volition or intelligence^ — it 
will become necessary to examine further. What are 
the circumstances under which we can recognise the 
operatiion of moral causes f and What the evidence 
by which their existence is substantiated ?

Evidence of Moral CausaUon. 

In pursuing the inquiry into the evidence we have 
of the influence of moral causes, we have only to 
bear in mind the distinction at first laid down ; by 
the aid of which, it will be apparent how the <qpera« 
tion of moral causes is distinguishable from the 
succession of physical. Moral causation, as we have 
observed, implies volition and intelligence: it is 
consequently marked by the indications of intdli- 
gence in the results produced. In the illustratioii 
before given*, we supposed a known intelligent agent 
exerting a physical influence on matter. If we 
witness only effects produced on matter, how are we 
to recognise an unseen intelligent agent, is the 
question now before us. 

To recur to an illustration similar to that before 
employed : — ^If a stone strike against an o1geet» U 
may have been projected either by some merely 
mechanical power, or by a voluntary agent ; and if 
we saw only the resulting impact, and not the 
origination of the motion, we should be unable to

decide which was the cause. But if we saw a 
number of such projectiles striking the object in 
succession, and all hitting it upon a certain mark, 
we should inmiediatelj conclude that the projectiles 
were aimed at that mark, and, therefore, that the 
whole was the result of some moral volition. And 
further, if we should see that the balls were impelled 
by the aid of a machine, and should find that it 
was so constructed as to dischaige a number succes- 
sively, without the intervention of any manual 
agency, this surely would in no way diminuh our 
impression, that the whole was designed, and 
originally set in action, by an intelligent agent. 
Nor, again, would it make any difference in our 
conclusion, whether or not we could discover any 
particular end which might be answered in striking 
the object ; though, if we should perceive or con- 
jecture such a design, it would of course add a 
further confirmation of our original impression. 

I^ on the contrary, we perceived the balls pro- 
jected at random, at irregular intervals, and in 
various directions, we could not infer such design or 
intelligence. In a word, from results apparently 
capricious, from effects uncertain and interrupted, 
from action regulated by no seeming plan, but of 
an arbitrary and inconstant character, we could infer 
no design, no volition, no moral cause. It is when 
results are reducible to regular rules, when observed 
actions are found to be consistent with some fixed 
and constant system ; when phenomena can be

117 



traced up to their determinate laws, or in other 
words (agreeably to what has been above main- 
tained), to their physical causes^ then, and then alone, 
it is, that wo can ascend to the idea of a regulating 
moral cause; and deduce the conclurion of super- 
intending volition and designing intelligence. 

In general then, the evidence and stamp of moral 
agency and intelligent influence, is found in the 
discovery of a tmifarm consistemy in the results^ in 
a regular arrangement of parts adapted to each 
other, and to the whole, such as to preclude at once 
the idea of caprice and chance, and that of blind 
unforcseeing fatality. And this may be distinguished 
into two kinds : — ^Ist Where a fixed end is discover- 
able, and we observe the direction of means to it, 
and changes taking place in furtherance of it. 2nd 
Where, although no such end is discoverable, and 
no change takes place, yet we perceive things 
arranged in a certain invariable order and symmetiy. 

In the study of the actual laws, mechanism, and 
arrangement of the natural world, we have a magni- 
ficent field open before us, in which to pursue the 
inquiry, whether such indications of moral causation 
can be traced; and this inquiry is in fact^ in its 
most* essential point, already answered in the con- 
clusions at which we arrive by inductive science the 
universal order and invariable harmony pervading 
the material univene.

physical causes, is, indeed, not to be mistaken ; and 
it may be truly said, that the sublime conclusions 
of natural theology, in their general and popular 
acceptation, are obirious on the most cursory survey 
of the natural world, and at once convincing, even 
to the most uninstructed apprehension. Unless 
miserably blinded by prejudice^ or incapacitated by 
moral perversion, the most untaught mind instantly 
recognises the evidences of the Divine existence 
and attributes, and unhesitatingly regards the visible 
order and adaptations of the natural world, as no 
other than the created manifestations of the Divine 
perfections. Let us, however, observe that the 
special object of natural theology, as a sdencej is to 
analyse the precise steps by which these conclusions 
are attained, and examine the security of the ground 
on which they rest. The preceding portion of this 
inquiiy has been directed in its proper way, towards 
this object, by scrutinizing the more general grounds 
on which all our ideas of the relation of effects to 
their causes depend ; and it is to the more particular 
application of these views to the great argument of 
natural theology that we are now to proceed. 

Nature of Find Causes. 



At the outset of this inquiiy, we meet with an 
expression veiy commonly employed, but often with 
little attention to accuracy of meaning; the con- 
dderation of what are called ** If luif ontMei;'* is referred 



TO NATUUL -mBOLOGT. 119 

to as the main evidence afforded by the study oi 
nature^ for the existence and perfectiona of the 
Deity. Here Uien, as in other case^ it is to the 
niesiuDg of the term that our attention must, in tlie 
first iustance, be carefollj directed. Now the ^pli- 
cation of the word " cause," when we speak of ** final 
causes," ia somewhat peculiar, and, in fact, such as 
very commonly to occasion mistake and di£ScuI^. Tet 
the phrase has been perhaps too stronj^y sanctioned 
by custom to allow an expectation that it can be 
generally discarded, even though we should gun 
considerably in perspicuity, by adopting other ex- 
pressions to convey the same meaning. 

A few instances will serve to illustrate the use ctf 
the term : — ^The circulation of the blood is said to be 
the final aiute of the valves in the blood vessels. 
It would not be considered correct language to call 

iit the cause simply: though by another modification 
of the word, we might say that the valves are 
ii provided hecaute of the circulation. We might easily 

n illustrate the distinction by abundance vi other 

] examples, from all parts of the natural world. 

] The variation of the seasons is said to be the 

ji fiwd cause of the obliquity of the earth's axis. The 

ji graminivorous or carnivorous constitution of «^i]imal^ 

J ih»jinal catue of the respective forms of their teeth 

J and feet The piunting of the image, exactly on the 

^ retina, is the final cause for the lens of the eye

ation of an image, free from colour (in perfect eyes), 
is the Jlnal cause of the lens and vitreous humour 
having their dispenuve powers in a certain relation 
to each^ hj which, in theoiy, that condition will be 
secured^. 

In all such instances we, in hcU use a veiy 
circuitous mode of expression in adopting the 
term '' final cause." It was remarked before^ 
that in ordinaiy language we often use the term 
^ cause" to signify the reason, object, or motive, 
influencing some moral or intelligent agent. Now 
when we consider the end or dengn^ in order to 
which, one thing is arranged in a certain adjustment 
to another : — ^when we observe things so adjusted to 
each other as to be able to trace manifest indications 
of such plan, then we say of two things so adjusted, 
that the one is the reason for the other ; that the 
first arrangement was made with a view to the 
second, or that the second is the use^ end^ final retuofi, 
or lastly, yfno/ cause^ of the other. We mean, then, 
a cause operating not in one arrangement upon 
the other, (as physical cause and effect,) to produce 
it, or even to regulate it, but in the motive or reasom 
of the intelligent agent, who, we infer, contrived and 
designed the adjustment. 

Thus the term ** final causef** reaDy implies no 
more than is implied by the term ^ design." In the

first instance^ ve find, as mere matter of fact and 
observation in the order of nature, a recondite adap- 



I tation, or fitness, of all the parts of organized bdngs, 

j and of all the functions of unorganized matter, to each 

other. We observe that every natural arrangement 
has its relations to other arrangements : that every 
physical effect has its dependencies, its uses^ its pur- 
poses, in reference to others. We discover that in 
every such relation, (so universally and immutably 
\ preserved,) some particular end is, in fact, answeredt 

I some particular object secured. It is from the notice 

i and conviction of this bare matter of fibct, that we 

1 are led on to the further idea and belief of design and 

1 intention : that the end which we see answered viras 

contemplated, that the object which we see attained 
was designed ^. 

There is, however, another sense in which the 
same term ''final cause" has been used by some 
writers, which it is worth while to consider, more 
. I especially as the confusion thus introduced has led 

to serious misapprehension of their opinions. 

In some cases we may trace the dependence of a / / 
i phenomenon through a series of physical causes ; ; ' 

i md the last, highest, or tdiimate^ cause to which we 

^ can thus refer, has been sometimes called the ^JUud 

i cause.** And where men have been unable or unwil- 

I ling to investigate such proximate physical causes^ 

they have been prone to refer at once, as an ultimate 
or ''final'' cause, to the vnll of the Deity; and to

resolve the whole into an immediate effect of the 
Divine interposition. We shall have occasion to 
recnr to some instances of this sort in the sequel ; for 
the present^ the following passage from an eminent 
philosopher will sufficiently exemplify the case :— 

Laplace observes^ 

^ Tons Ics evenement^ cenx m&ne qui par lenr 
petitesse^ semblent ne pas tenir aux grandes lois de 
la nature^ en sent une suite aussi necessaire que les 
revolutions du soldL Dans Fignorance des liens qui

ces causes imaginaires ont ete suocessivement reculeea 
avec les homes de nos connaissances, et disparaissent 
entierement devant la saine philosophie qui ne voit 
en elles» que Texpression de Tignorance oil nous 
sommes des veritables causes*." 

From this passage it is manifest that the author 
uses the term *^ final cause^** simply in the sense of 
** arbitrary agency,** or ** direct intervention :** or, in 
other words, employs the term *^ final** as equivalent 
to '^ ultimate.* 

To add another remark: 

The inquiry into final causes may fairly call for 
the exercise of much caution in distinguishing reoi 
cases of adaptation firom many which are but i^^Mk 
reid and fimdfuL Far-fetched and overstrained 
instances of this kind are sometimes urged where

no real or substantial indications of design can be 
rationally admitted. And those who are bent on 
finding such evidences everywhere, are too apt hastily 
to decide that one result was actually ordained with 
a special view to another, where the connexion is too 
remote to allow us reasonably to consider it so. 
Such a course is apt to produce no other result than 
that of exposing to reproach the whole investigation 
of final causes. And the judicious inquirer will per- 
ceive at once the injury done to the truth by weak 
and delusive arguments adduced in its support, and 
how little need there is for such doubtful aid in the 
abundance of substantial evidences with which we 
are surrounded. 

Use of Final Cau»e$ in Science. 

The only case in which there can be any reasonable 
ground for dispute about the use of terms, is where 
they may be so chosen as to lead to ambiguity or 
mistake, as to the ideas for which they stand. 

Now much discusdon has arisen as to the investi- 
gation of final causes ; and, especially, whether the 
study of them be a legitimate part of the province of 
natural philosophy. But all dispute may, I concdve^ 
be avoided, simply by attention to the precise meaning 
of the term. 

According to what was above observed^ we cer- 
tainly may agree to use the term ** final cause** at 
simply equivalent to describing the fact of the 



'V«: 




^ifcflteJ^iiyiMiHJttUiyMlMiittaMWfiMiidiMiiu^ 



124 RELATION OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE 

adjustment which we actually ohserve. Our meaning 
will then be totally free from all ambiguity. But 
then, this is only an inconvenient and circuitous way 
of expressing what would be more clearly and simply 
described by the plainer terms, ** fitness," ** arrange, 
ment,** ^ adaptation,** of things to each other. 

On these grounds I agree, therefore, with those 
who prefer to discard altogether the use of the term 
^ final cause^** and to employ in its stead only the 
plain terms ** acyustment," &C., which express the 
fiacts we actually observe or inductively collect. 

We should thus be relieved from all controversy 
about the introduction of final causes in natural 
philosophy. Since no dispute exists as to the pro- 
prie^, nay necessity, of considering those adaptations 
and arrangements in our physical inquiries which 
are in a great measure forced on our observation, and 
without which our researches would be miserably 
defective in their most valuable, instructive, and 
important results. 

In regard to the reasoning, we should thus escape 
all danger of perplexing (even in appearance) the 
order and chain of it ; which is often greatly entan- 
gled by the mere introduction of an ambiguous 
term. By adhering to these more simple and per- 
qpicuous modes of expression, we should more 
palpably preserve that distinctness of meaning in 
form, whicht at all events, must be preserved in 
substance. We shall keep clear the if^ereneei from 
the order of physical causes^ and the study of the

causes tlionsdees : in other words^ we shall not con- 
found physical caitses with moral agenof ; but sludl be 
prepared, in the only sound and legitimate way, to 
deduce the indications of the latter from the 
former. 

The term ^ final cause,** employed in the sense at 
first explained, as that which it must in strictness 
bear ; viz^ as involving a reference to the processes 
of creative intelligence ; is doubtless most improperly 
introduced into the investigation by which we 
advance to the elementary truths of natural philo- 
sophy. And manifestly for this reason, that it > 
expresses, and thus misleads us into making the 
assumption of the very thing which it ought to be 
our object to pwve from the truths elicited by natural 
science ; viz., the existence of creative intelligence / 
of an omnipotent and omniscient Creator. ' 

But it has been contended that the study of ^ final 
causes** may be, and has been, of important use in 
physical discovery : and the well-known example is 
adduced of the discovery of the circulation of the 
blood by Harvey, in consequence of a reflection into 
which he M*as led on the probable use of the valves in 
the veins. 

Let us keep to unambiguous terms, and the case 
merely shows that a good conjecture, derived from 
the observed fitness of the valves for such an office at 
would be discharged by them, {/*the circulation were . 
a fact, led him to the rigid train of analogy ^ which he 
so completely verified by observation. In this way

it is often the case in the researches of the naturalist, 
that firom observing the obvious purpose of some one 
organ, he is able to conjecture the probable use of 
some other, which, but for such analogy, would be 
totally obscure ; and such conjectures, if well founded, 
seldom fail to be borne out by actual experimental 
proof. 

The tucs of things (simply so considered,) wherever 
they have been fairly traced and established, supply 
a perfectly just, and most useful ground of analogy 
for guiding us to inductive conclusions. The habit 
of observing such adaptations in actual cases sug- 
gests grounds of reasonable probability for expecting 
them in instances as yet untried ; and such conjectures 
in skilful hands are of the utmost utility in physical 
inquiries ; as we often noticed, in the course of our 
former illustrations. 

So long, then, as we confine ourselves to the 
ample notion of theyod of adjustmenU or use^ without 
reference to moral or intellectual causation, we are 
not departing from sound physical analogies^ which 
we have before contended are the only rational 
guides in those coiyectures which lead to sound 
inductions. 



The Economy of Causes. 

Another instance of the use of final causes in 
physical investigation, on which much stress has been 
sometimes laid, is the reference to what has been

called the ** lex parsimoniflc," the ** economy of caasea^" 
or the principle that ^ nature does nothing in vain ;** 
or that the most simple means are al^i^ys adopted 
for obtaining given ends ; or that several powers or 
agents are never resorted to where one suffices. 
Such a principle finds its use and application in aid 
of scientific research, when it is taken as a guide to 
the more simple in preference to the more complex 
theory; to known causes rather than imaginary; to 
hypotheses already applying in other cases rather 
than new and arbitrary ones; to analogies with 
existing and established relations rather than to 
gratuitous suppositions. 

Of this kind were the arguments from probability^ 
which weighed most with Copernicus and with 
Galileo, in fovour of the solar system, at a period 
when no demonstration had been attained; and a 
more precise exempUfication has been found in the 
argument for the earth's motion in its orbit^ and its 
rotation on its axis, being derived from one and the 
same primary impulse. It having being shown by 
Bemouilli, on mechanical principles, that one impulse 
would produce both, and even the precise point of 
the earth calculated at which it must have been 
applied, so as to accord with the existing motions 
and velocities. 

Upon this I will merely observe that the prin- 
ciple referred to^ when stated in simple and precise 
terms, is, in fiftct, nothing more than the announce- 
ment of a great physical and inductive law» the

in our mode of enunciating it, to keep it carefully

of speculative assumptions. For (precisely as we 
have noticed in other cases) it is in this way alone 
that we can consistently and rationally employ any 
guide to scientific conclusions, when those veiy 
conclusions are to form the evidence of the truths of 
natural theology. For the legitimate force of such 
arguments, it is manifestly essential that we avoid 
making them arguments in a circle ; and that we do 
not assume the operation of the Divine will in the

Final Causes in Comparative Physiology. 

The question respecting the introduction of final 
causes into philosophy has been made peculiarly 
prominent in the controverqr which has subsisted 
between two distinguished schools of physiology in 
France, to whose general views of oiganization we 
have already adverted*. The question with regard 
to final causes has, in fiict, been mixed up with the 
purely physiological question at issue between them, 
from which it undoubtedly is quite distinct, and 
ought, especially in an inquiry like the present, to be

carefully kept so. lu the views whidi have been 
taken of this controversj* \re maj also observe that 
the tendeiunf ascribed to the respective opinions has 
had a considerable share in influencing the judgment 
formed upon them; and has, perhaps, assisted in 
obscuring their real character ; which, when dispas- 
sionately examined, seems to me by no means such 
as to justify the strong censure of the one and pre- 
ference of the other, which has been sometimes 
expressed. 

Cuvier and his followers have insisted strongly on 
the propriety of pursuing physiological examination 
upon the assumption, that every part of the organ!* 
zation of an animal must have some me^ and that 
then by comparison of one part with another, we 
should proceed to trace tJie paflicular use and inten- 
tion of each organ, and so advance to our conclu- 
sion as to the nature of the animal, and its place in 
the scale of creation. Cuvier specifically states this 
principle of what he terms ** the conditions of 
existence,'' as equivalent to what are commonly 
called ** final causes ;" and speaks of the combinatioii 
of organs adapted to ^ the part which the animal has 
to play in nature.** And in aflSrming this^ Cuvier 
has but extended and followed up the method of the 
most distinguished of his predecessors^ who have 
generally regarded this adaptation of parts in oiga- 
nized structures as not only an inference deduced 
from all researches, but a sure guide in further 
investigations.

To these yiews the advocates of theory of ** unity 
of composition,'' or ** analogues,'' have been strongly 
opposed. Geoi&oy St Hilaire, while he confesses 
that ** it is very difficult for the most cautious man 
never to have recourse to final causes in his expla- 
nations," yet agrees with Bacon in considering them 
as ^ sterile ;" and expressly observes, ** I take care 
not to ascribe any intention to Grod ; for I mistrust 
the feeble powers of my reason. I observe hct» 
merely, and go no further. I only pretend to the 
character of the historian of what is. I cannot 
make nature an intelUgent agent who does nothing 
in vain, who acts by the shortest mode, who does 
all for the best* " And again remarks upon the 
before-quoted expression of Cuvier, ^ I know 
nothing of animals who Jiave to play a part in 
naturef ." He has also illustrated his ideas still fur- 
ther by the remark, that when it is stated, for 
example, that fishes have certain locomotive powers 
because they are destined to live . in the water, ** by 
the same reasoning you would say of a man who 
makes use of crutches, that he was originally des* 
tined to the misfortune of having a leg paralyzed or 
amputated.** 

Let us merely, in these cases, as in others, look 
to the correctness of our reasonings if we be really 
aiming at a sound analysis of the evidences of truth. 
Let us but guard against the manifest error of

for granted the thing to bo proved. If in 
logical, as in any other inqnirj, we set ont by 
asiuminy design, intention, or in a word, a moral 
coHse, then it is clear that any inference we may wish 
to draw in support of the truth of natural theology, 
is vitiated and nullified. Considered, therefore^ as 
taken in the correct order of reasoning, the caution 
expressed by Gcof&oy St Hilaire, appears to me 
strictly just, and the censure %vhich has been cast 
upon it undeserved. If he did set out by ^ascribing 
intention to the Deity,** he could not arrive at any 
proof of such intention. The reason, indeed, which 
he assigns of ** mistrusting his feeble powers^** 
appears to me to be a wrong one ; it should rather 
be that all reasoning would thus be lost, and all its 
steps confounded together. But as a physiologist, 
as supplying the materials for the conclusions of 
natural theology, he is undoubtedly right in assuming 
solely the character of the historian, and seeking, 
only bare facts and laws, that he may from (hem 
elicit the great inferences to which they lead. To 
assume the ^ economy** of causes, to *^ make nature 
an intelligent agent** in the outset, would be to 
anticipate the conclusion ; if the idea itself do nof 
involve an entire confusion of thought. To assign 
to animals ^ a part to play** before we have traced 
their analogies, is surely premature in the order ot 
just reasoning, if by that expression anything more 
be meant than the mere guiding coigectuie which 
the structure of their organs may suggest

It is equally true that the habit of making such 
assumptions, even tacitly, is difficult to avoid. Be- 
cause when proofs have already largely accumulated* 
we are of course prepossessed with the conclusion 
which we suppose the further instances must also 
substantiate. But when our avowed, object is the 
exact discrimination of evidence as such, anid the 
strict analysis of our impressions into their logical 
elements, the distinctions must be studiously kept 
in view. 

The illustration of the man on crutches has been 
blamed as idle and unbecoming. It does not appear 
to me deserving of censure in this >vay, though I 
think it inapplicaUe^ as being an argument upon an 
isolated and accidental case; the essence of such 
reasoning consists in its extension to entire species 
and classes of beings in their natural relations. At 
all events, whatever may be thought of the parti- 
cular illustration, ilie same remark must be still 
applied with regard to any assumption of designing 
moral agency in the adaptation. 

Let us, in such reasoning, only bear in mind these 
obvious distinctions. Let us not allow physical 
investigation to borrow from natural theology, if it 
is to furnish the very means of support to divine 
truth. Let not natural theology be made to 
minister to science^ if science is to be the hand- 
maid to natural theology. 

In physical laws wo must keep dear of assuming 
moral causation. But the general laws and analogies

al'ready established maj fhirlj be taken as our guides 
to others yet to be made out They, indeed, muH 
be so appealed to ; for, as wo endeavoured to show 
at the outset, they are recognised, and bear an 
essential part, even in the strictest logical analysis 
of inductive reasoning*. 

In the particular instance, then, of the physio- 
logical topics referred to, we may iUrly adopt (as 
the evidence may seem to warrant,) either the prin- 
ciple of ^ analogues,** or of the ''use of oigans,** (this 
latter being carefully distinguished in meaning from 
any idea of moral causation.) But these or other 
equivalent physiological ilieories must be taken 
simply as such, and barely as &r as they are war- 
ranted by inductive laws ; and in this way they may 
be most correctly adopted, and even become indis- 
pensable as our guides in considering any new case^ 
or carrying on any further research.

* considered as so much opposed, especially in their 
bearing upon the conclusions of natural theology, do 
not, upon closer examination, appear to present any- 
thing really at variance. Without pretending to 
form an opinion on their respective merits, consi- 
dered physiologically, I will merely observe this 
much : Both systems tend equally to establish the 
existence of profomidly adjusted order and unifor- 
mity in nature^ though of somewhat different kinds. 
The one system contemplates the entire range of 
animated beings, and unveils to the well-directed 
eye of the physiolo^t the most marvellous preserva- 
tion of exact analogy, even throughout the most 
apparently trackless mazes of dissimilarity. The 
other, without taking this wide range, yet establishes 
the same truth, within more limited and detached 
portions of the field of inquiry, and ^^thin those 
several limited portions enlarges greatly our percep- 
tion of the combination of acyustments in which the 
same great principles are manifested. 

The one theory dwells on the relations and adap- 
tations of whole classes and orders of animated 
structures to each other ; the other, on the relations 
and adaptations of the several parts of one animated 
structure to each other, and to the purpose of the 
preservation and well-being of the whole. The one 
leads us to consider the more abstract analogies 
which connect together the various parts of Anim^tf^ 
nature by general laws; the other, the more practical 
relations and mutual subserviency of the parts of

organic structures to tbe purposes of animal exis- 
tence. The one shows a vast and perfect compo- 
sition, an elaborate and systematic design, presented 
to our contemplation ; the other, a profoundly inge- 
nious and complicated machine set in action. 

Now, if we consider the bearing of these views on 
natural theology, it must, I think, be admitted that 
they both, though in somewhat different ways, tend 
equally to substantiate the great inference of design. 
In the universal preser^'ation of systematic order, 
susceptible of exact classification bj pervading ana- 
logies, there is just the same indication of design and 
intelligence as in the adaptation and adjustment of the 
parts of any individual machinery to an end. 

An elaborate design of art, a w*ell-propordoned 
edifice, a magnificent painting, though addressing 
themselves solely to our contemplation in their silent 
and immovable i^roportions, are surely quite as 
forcible manifestations of intellect and genius, as the 
most skilfully contrived piece of machinery in inces- 
sant activity, fabricating the most useful productions. 

Either way, then, in the study of nature there is 
an equally clear manifestation of that infinite intel- 
ligence, which, after the inductive examination of the 
laws or adjustments in cither case, we are directly 
led to acknowledge as the irresistible conclusion. 
And as this is the case with either species of inves- 
tigation singly, so will it be more pre-eminently tme 
when both are pursued jointly, as they assuredly may 
be, without the smallest detriment to each other, or

confusion of first principles, provided only we keep 
strictly to the simplest rule of all just reasoning, and 
do not confound our final conclusion with our first 
assumption. 

The highest philosophy is most disposed to cherish 
a readiness to perceive and admit the fiiir indications 
of design and intelligence, in whatever form they may 
present themselves ; and there is a wider expansion 
given to our views when we thus include the con- 
templation of order and symmetry, (even though we 
perceive not their end or object,) in our notion of 
design. In such considerations we may find the 
loftiest exercise of truly philosophical reflections; 
we shall realize the highest aim of scientific specu- 
lation ; and shall recognise the truth of the remark 
so forcibly expressed by Dugald Stewart : — ^ There 
is a certain character, or stjfle (if I may use the 
expression,) in the operations of Divine Wisdom; 
something which evcr}'where announces, amidst an 
infinite variety of detail, an inimitable unity and 
harmony of design ; and in the perception of which 
pkUoiopfiical wgacity and genius seem chiefly to 
eonsistV

and modification of organized structurefl^ Uimn from 

botanj. 

In the classification of plants alone, whether on mn 
artificial or a natural system, vre trace the clearert 
indications of this pervading principle. But so little 
is the bearing of it perceived, that nothing is more 
common than to hear ridicule cast on the empCinesfl^ 
as it is considered, and pedantry of scientific nomen- 
clature and systematic arrangement. Those vdio 
ignorantly indulge in this kind of censure are little 
able to understand how much even this mere classi- 
fication implies. Had it no other use, the mere hct 
of an unfailing reduction of each individual and each 
species to its place in a system, is itself an nnqne&- 
tionable and obvious indication of plan and desigii 
in the organization of those individuals and species. 
The system may be artificial and complex, the 
nomenclature may seem dry, technical, and pedantic^ 
but the existence of order is real ; and the inTariable 
adherence to a certain determined set of types and 
forms is nothing less than one of the most dedsive 
evidences of that pervading uniformitj throoghoat 
nature, which is the legitimate manifestation of one 
presiding intelligence. 

But nowhere, perhaps, in the compass of this sci- 
ence is the truth of our position more angolaily 
confirmed than in the remarkable fiict obserred by 
botanical physiologists, of the existence of iAortim, 
yet always symmetrical parts in' plants. The solgeet

inaugural lecture on botany,) and I cannot better 
conTcj an idea of it than in his own words : — 

^ We find parts existing in a rudimentary or abor- 
tiTe state in one species, which in others serve some 
manifestly important office ; neither would it be any 
objection to the idea of design, if it could be proTed 
that in this rudimentary condition they were abso- 
lutely useless, although it must be considered an 
additional proof of arrangement, when, as in many 
instancec^ we are able to show that they become sub- 
servient to a new purpose by being unfitted to their 
primary one*.* 

After jiving some instances of these occasional 
transmutations of function and character) the author 
observes distinctly, that, apart from this, the exis- 
tence of these abortive organs in a regular symmetiy 
is alone an indication of design ; and quotes in sup- 
port of his view the following remarkable illustration 
from M. De CandoUe : —

permitted to avail myself of a comparison somewhat 
mean and trivial, I may, perhaps, render my views

aflTorded that this banquet' is not the result of chance^ 
but has been due to the will of an intelligent being. 
No doubt I should remark that each of the dishes is 
in itself well prepared, (this is the argument of the 
anatomist,) and that the selection of them implies a 

r 

reference to the wants of the individuals who partake 
of it This is the reasoning of the physiologist. 
But may I not likewise obserTe that the dishes that 
constitute this repast are arranged in a certain sym- 
metrical order, such as is agreeable to the eye and 
plunly announces design and volition ? 

** Now, if on examining the above arrangement I 
should find certain dishes repeated, as for instance in 
double rows, for no other apparent reason than that 
the one might, in a manner, correspond to the other ; 
or observe, tliat the places which they should occupy 
were filled with imitations of the real dishes, which 
seem of no use with reference to the object of the 
repast, ought I on that account to reject the idea of 
design? 

^ So far from this, I might infer from the very 
circumstances stated, an attention to synmietrical 
arrangement, and consequently the operation of 
intelligence. 

''Now, this is precisely what happens on the great 
scale in nature. Considerations derived from the 
symmetiy of parts correct, in great measure^ what 
is deficient in the theory of final causes, and tend»

even to transform them into evidences of the exis-

I will not injure the. force and beauty of this illus- 
tration bj any comment. The^ conclusion appears to 
me irresistible, that symmetiy of arrangement is as 
decided a jiroof of design as adjustment of mechar 
nism : — beauty and harmony as clear indications of 
mind, as combination of mechanical action. 

Examples from Physiology. 

Few parts of the oiganized body were more com- 
pletely involved in obscurity as to their nature and 
functions than the nervous system; until of late 
years^ by the united labours of Sit Charles Bell, 
M. Magendie, and Mr. Herbert Mayo, a valuable 
light has been shed upon the subject. 

All parts of the body over which we have any 
control, are found to be furnished with two distinct 
sets of nerves. Every part has also, as we well 
know, two distinct powers or functions, one passive, 
or that of sensation: the other active, or that of 
voluntary motion. Of the two sets of nerves one 
invariably gives the -first power: the other the 
second. 

This recondite distinction of use and properties^ 
so undeviating in the midst of the greatest apparent 
complexity, is surely a striking instance of the most 
beautiful harmony between the distribution of the 
oigans and the corresponding functions. Though vre

perceive no mechanical principle of contriTance, nor 
(in the ordinaiy sense) any reason for the twofold 
system of nerves. 

But these researches have been carried further : 
at first sight nothing would seem more devoid of 
order or method than the arrangement of the origins 
of the respective sjrstems of nerves. Mr. H. Mayo^, 
however, has succeeded in reducing the apparent 
confusion to a simple system. He has made out the 
general law of distribution, that the nerves of motion 
have their roots in the same part or segment of the 
nervous centre as the corresponding and accom- 
panying nerves of sensation. 

The same physiologist has pursued the subject 
more recently, and has deduced many curious results, 
especially involving the confirmation of the pro* 
found anticipations of Dr. ^Vhytt (1768); which are 
remarkable as tending to simplify and reduce to a 
common principle, the instances of many motions 
and affections, which have been regarded as involun- 
tary ; of which we seem unconscious ; but which yet 
are really results of volition, though overlooked from 
habit. The consideration of probability and analogy 
derived from the simplicity of nature, was here the 
guiding principle which led the author to his 
inferences! ; and which is so beautifully confiimed 
by fhem.

The cases last referred to afford good examples of 
a simplification of principle, which, may be fidrly 
urged as a proof of Presiding Intelligence in the 
arrangement of the organized body, though we see 
nothing but the indications of this sjrmmetry and 
order, and no positive perception of a use or end 
answered. To look only to such purposes, or prac- 
tical contriTances, is to take far too narrow a view 
of final causes. We should leam to trace design 
equally, perhaps even more clearly, in cases where 
we perceive no end or practical design, but where 
the influence of ordaining intelligence is displayed 
solely in the continually increasing simplicity of 
principle and symmetry of arrangement, which are 
constantly opening upon us in every successive 
advance of discovery. 

It has been admirably observed by the distinguished 
physiolo^st just referred to, ** As philosophy advances 
the properties of matter are perpetually found to be 
fewer and simpler; which the creative wisdom so 
combines and directs as to produce the most diver- 
sified, and, at first sight, opposite results*.** The 
disclosure of such a j^rinciple alone seems to me to 
constitute the highest kind of proof of presiding and 
ordaining Intelligence. I have above referred to 
some instances in support of it ; but I must here 
add one more case, which places the argument in 
a peculiarly striking point of view, derived from the

researches of modem physiology; and which I 
cannot express better than in the words of the same 
author*: — 

^One common commencement is there for the 
development of all the families of vertebral animals. 
There is a period after its commencement, when the 
frame in outline being already distinct, the class 
even of the individual is indistinguishable, whether 
it be fish, reptile, bird, mammiferous animal, or even 
man. For a time, these all march parallel, alike in 
all things, the highest not differing from the lowest. 
For example : the fish, the lowest in the scaler is 
formed to breathe the waters ; for this purpose in 
its throat there must be openings made, to give 
passage to the water through its gills. These open^ 
ings are called branchial apertures. The reptile has 
no need of these openings ; but they are formed in 
it. In the bird they would serve no use ; but they 
are there. In the mammiferous animal again, in 
man, they are useless, but they are still present. 
Respiratory apertures in the neck, with a single 
heart, and a corresponding distribution of the aorta» 
form the early undistinguished and undistingnishing 
type stamped on the whole range of vertebrata. 

** But now a difference begins. This character of 
organization is to be permanent in fish. In fish, 
therefore, it now expands and amplifies itself. At 
the corresponding period, in the higher ftnimAli^ it

fades and disappears; shrinking, while a higher order 
of organization supersedes it, and parts are developed 
which in the fish appear not This hiw holds 
throughout the economy. There is one common 
type for the brain at its first production, which 
remains permanent in the lowest tribes, but is 
improTed upon by fresh developments in each above. 
Thus the brain of man at first resembles that of a 
fish, then of a reptile and bird : finally, it becomes 
the mammiferous brain, then human.* 

On contemplating so truly astonishing a train of 
development as is here unfolded, the reflection 
which presents itself to the mind may, in the first 
instance^ be very different from that which is 
induced on a more enlarged consideration of the 



In the gradual stages of the process here unveiled, 
we perceive organs bestowed apparently without 
discrimination as to the future destiny of the crea- 
ture: adapted in many to no perceptible end; in 
fact, positively useless and superfluous. All notion 
of final causes seems excluded; and all idea of 
a(\justment to a purpose^ violated. Even the sup- 
pression of a useless organ, and the substitution or 
super-induction of one which is useful, seems a 
circuitous and unnecessarily complex process of 
obtaining the end ultimately accomplished. 

But when we look at the regularity of the sjfstem 
on which all this is planned ; when we conrider that

the precise order in which thej disappear, exactly in 
accordance with the destined diflference of function in 
the different species ; when we trace the undeviating 
scheme on which the new modifications are respeo-

minate scale, according to which the whole process 
is unalterably carried on ; — ^then we shall be urged 
with an increasing and accumulating force of con* 
viction, to the conclusion that all this arrangement, 
however apparently complex, is, in reality, an asto- 
nishing instance of conformity to laws of the most 
recondite simplicity : that every step in the process, 
however apparently superfluous, is in strict accord- 
ance with a great principle of uniformity : that every 
stage in the transformation, however, in first appear- 
ance, destitute of direction to a purpose of utility, 
yet, if it answer no other, has its direct application 
in filling up a place in the universal harmony and 
incomparable unity of design, which pervades all 
organized nature. The very singularity of the pro- 
vision, well considered, evinces the enlarged pre* 
servation of analogy : the very objection and difficulty 
of the case is converted into an evidence in favour 
of the aigument from symmetry. 

But this is not all: an extension of the same 
principle^ nearly obvious when once it has been 
made known, enables us entirely to refute one of the 
most plausible objections^ and remove one of the

itself as a positiTe exception to the harmony of 
design in the animal organization ; the existence of 
cases of malformation. These are now understood,

any anomalous interfering cause, but simply to a defi-

Prarimate Causes compared with Ftjced Laws. 

The distinction which has been before drawn be- 
tween physical and moral causation, and the relation 
of cause and efiect, may tend, in no small degree^ to 
remove a difficulty sometimes felt in the estimate of 
the proofs of creative wisdom and power supplied 
by the contemplation of organized life as compared 
with those derived from the study of the heavenly 
bodies. In the former case, the production of 
animal and vegetable life is observed to be always 
in connexion with a proximate material cause. In 
the latter we can conceive no material cause of the 
existence and motions of the planetary system. 
Hence it has been noticed that the former class of

pbenomena do not furnish (to some minds at least,) 
the same conclusive evidence of a Deity as the 
latter*. 

Now when the nature of physical or material 
causes is distinctly understood according to the view 
we have here taken of it» it becomes evident that 
the material or physical agency which is referred to 
in the production of organized life, is nothing more 
than the scries of laws to which we are able to 
reduce those processes of nature. We trace an 
invariable course of sequence and dependence of one 
phenomenon or effect, upon another of a more general 
kind. We can follow up these trains of conse- 
quence through a considerable number of step% and 
thus perceive a connected series of laws impressed 
upon the functions of material and organized beings. 
In the case of the heavenly bodies we cannot do 
this, at least with reference to the origination of 
their motions, or adjustment of their masses and 
distances. The difference, then, is solely that we 
can trace a longer series and a more complicated 
system of physical laws in the one case than in the 
other ; and therein it would seem to follow a greater 
rather than a less manifestation of design and intel^ 
ligence in the former case. In neither do we arrive 
at any efficient causation or moral agency but by 
carefully establishing the material indications of it ; 
and it is solely fi*om the adjustment of physical lawa

tbat vre are able to trace those indications. The 
material proximate causes (as they are termed,) of 
the production of organized life are causes of a dif- 
ferent kind from that moral causation which, in the 
imposition of laws on matter, and in calling that 
matter into its existing combinations, we recognise 
as creative power. 

Evidences of Creation. 

Ju8T and sober inductive science, applied to the 
examination of the actual structure of the earth's 
crust, enables us with satisfaction and certainty to 
trace the changes which have taken place on the 
surfiu^ of a globe possessing the same nature as the 
existing earth, and in the structure and habits of 
oiganized beings analogous to those now inhabiting 
the world. It investigates the alterations which 
have been effected by physical agents resembling 
those now in operation, and in accordance with 
general laws the same as those now recognised in 
the economy of nature. 

But it does not, and cannot rise to the disclosure 
of what occurred under a different state of things^ or 
owing to the action of causes of a different order 
from those now discovered by physical research. It 
cannot show a chaos, or trace the evolution of a 
world out of it It cannot reason upon a supposed 
state of universal confusion and ruin, and the imme- 
diate reduction of it into order and arrangement.

It can investigate the changes of things, but not 
their origin; in a irord, sound geology vrill never 
aspire to the character of cosmogonj. 

Greology is, indeed, pre-eminently distinguished 
from other branches of physical science in this, that 
while they teach us only the existing order of nature^ 
this carries us back in time^ and shows a period 
when the present races of organized beings did not 
exist ; and by consequence, establishes the fact of a 
creation, that is, more properly, of a series of crea- 
tions; and these manifestly not brought about at 
any one marked period, or extending to all animated 
nature at once, but by the slow and gradual intro- 
duction of each new species as the older disappeared. 

The successive strata are the sepulchres of succes-t 
sive races of organized beings, difTering more or less 
from existing si)ecies ; and those of the least anti* 
quity containing extinct species, co-existent with 
those now tenanting the globe, and bearing decisive 
evidences of progressive, local, gradual deposition 
and elevation. The marks of sudden violence^ in* 
deed, are occasionally seen in all formations; but 
their occurrence is the exception, not the rule; and 
in its most extreme cases, always limited to a narrow 
local extent. No one simultaneous universal change 
has ever taken place on the surface of the globe ; 
but all effects, however great, have been aocom* 
plished by a series of local and partial changes ; and 
even where we may be left to conjecture as. to the 
violence or suddenness of those changes with reqpeet

to tiniCf we have ocular proof of their extent in 
^kice. All that geology establishes, then, in this 
particular, is the &ct of the gradual origination of 
new species, but by no means the particular method 
or process by which it has been brought about. 

It i^true there have not been wanting theories to 
explain these^processes on natural principles. Yet 
of theses the most celebrated have failed to stand 
the test of increasing observation ; while none, per- 
haps, have been altogether satisfactory or free from 
material objections. Physical research cannot bring 
us to any distinct idea of the nature of creation. 
If we consider the simple case of the introduction 
of a single new species, or even individual of a new 
species, there is an obvious limit imposed on our 
speculations. On the- other hand, it is freely open 
to the physical inquirer to trace, as closely as pos- 
sible, the secondary nieanSf as fSetr as the nature of the 
case admits ; to investigate rigorously, for example, 
all the modifications which change of climate, domes- 
tication, crossing of breeds, &c., may produce. Such 
inquiries may be far from successful ; they may lead 
only to some few imperfect conclusions utterly insuf- 
ficient to ground any theory upon; but certainly 
this is the only course open to the inductive inquirer. 

The question respecting the immutability of spe- 
cies, and the possibility of a transition from one into 
another; of such modifications as we observe in 
intermediate races being perpetuated ; of new spe- 
cies being thus eventually introduced; with the

various collateral topics which are inTolved in these 
inquiries, have all formed the sulgects of anxious 
debate, and even of animated controversj, among 
physiologists. There has undoubtedly been a pre- 
ponderance of evidence against the notion ; and the 
high authority of Cuvier has been claimed as head- 
ing the phalanx of the opponents. Whilst on the 
other hand, Geoffroj St. Hilaire has spoken of the 
^ age of Cuvier^ as approaching its termination, 
and the immutability of species as a conviction fiut 
fading away from men*s minds. All that I presume 
to observe on such a subject is this : that it is a 
question fairly open to philosophical discusdon; 
and one which is at any rate the only avenue to a 
scientific solution of the problem. If natural science 
be ever able to conduct us to the knowledge of such 
a point, it must be by some such route as this. 
And we have no more reason to despair of its doing 
so in this case than in any of the other instances of 
philosophical discovery, which in a past age might 
have been pronounced as hopeless and visionaiy as 
some are now disposed to consider this. While we 
must also recollect that all the conclusions which 
have been deduced from the observed facts relating 
to the modifications of species are restricted by the 
condition of the short period of time during which 
their operation has been contemplated ; and that we 
must admit as essentially influential the very diflferent 
circumstances which might affect similar operationt 
continued through unlimited periods of past duiatioiu

The appeal to another kind of evidence, to know- 
ledge derived from another source than that of phy- 
sical inquiry conducted on the principles of esta- 
blished natural analo^es, would merely transfer our 
inquiry out of the pale of physical science into that 
of moral authority, and would consequently divest 
it of all force in respect to the purpose of substan- 
tiating the great truths of natural theology. The 
proper conclusions of physical inquiry are to be 
directed only to the two simple points, the actual 
occurrence of successive originations of species, and 
the elucidation, as far as possible, of the secondaiy 
means by which those originations may have been 
brought about. 

Geology, then, affords abundant proof of the fitct 
that there was a time when the present races of 
oiganized beings did not exist, and consequently 
bears direct testimony to the occurrence of what we 
term creation ; that is, the introduction of new spe- 
cies ; as it does also of the previous introduction of a 
vast series of other species, of which it also shows 
the successive extinction. But the evidence is per- 
fectly clear as to the gradual character of this intro- 
duction of species. Those now existing are found 
to have co-existed with others now extinct, as these 
did in their turn with those of older date, untU we 
arrive at periods when whole genera and classes were 
entirely different But at no period do we find an 
absence of oiganized life followed by a simultaneous 
universal production of it

When, therefore, on geolo^cal grounds* \re speak 
of the evidence of creation, we must carefully bear 
in mind what is meant, and must restrict our mean- 
ing to the gradual appearance of one increasing 
family, while another was as gradually wasting away 
and disappearing. Geology, in a word, bears witness 
to a continued, perhaps perpetual successions of 
creations. It consequently tends infinitely to exalt 
our ideas of that eternal and overruling Omnipotence 
by whose agency they were brought about. 

But no researches have disclosed the mode in 
which this has taken place, nor the process by which 
such a result of creative Omnipotence has been 
accomplished. It only assures us that it was not 
applied to all existing species at any one time. 
While, therefore, geology has been unable to trace 
the mode of the Divine operations, it has, beyond all 
question, substantiated the fact of such creative 
processes. And the leading truth of this gradual 
progress of the development of the varieties of 
organized life corresponding with changes in the 
disposition of the solid materials of the earth's sur- 
face, and of the temperature and climate, is perhaps 
among the most striking and beautiful points of 
evidence which geology affords to the conclusions of 
natural theology*.

this unbroken continuance of uniform laws and har- 
monious adaptation to >vhich geology bears testimony, 
existing throughout all the vast series of the successive 
orders of organized beings which have tenanted the 
glolje, which, while it exhibits the greatest diversity 
in the forms of life and structure whicU have pre- 
viuled at different remote epochs, yet shows every 
where the preservation of the same most perfect 
harmony and analogy through periods of incalculable 
duration. And it is to be particularly observed how 
essential to this argument is the fact (before dwelt 
upon,) that all this was absolutely %ininlen*upted by 
any period of anarchy, by the occurrence of any 
general ruin or disorganization, by the intervention 
of any epoch at which the traces of organization 
were obliterated, or defaced, or disturbed, or at which, 
at least, a large part of the earth's surface was not 
teeming with animation, and richly furnished with 
all the accessories of life and enjojrment 

Remarks similar to those just made on the idea of 
crealioih will in fact apply >nth considerable force to 
the entire argument of natural theology. Natural 
science can exhibit to us nothing but a series of 
physical causation ; from this we infer design, that is^ 
moral causation. But no such deduction can ever 
guide us to the discovery of the mode of operation, 
or enable us to trace the method by which the 
supreme volition executed its designs, or to supply 
the connecting link between physical and moiml 
causation*

Fived Laws the Proofs of Design. 



The last remark leads us naturally to a more extended 
view of the evidence derived from the actual preva- 
lence, so far as we can trace it, of one fixed system 
of physical laws. 

We have already observed the importance of the 
testimony which all science gives to the invariable 
order and constant uniformity of the laws of the 
material world. From what we know, observe, and 
calculate, we are led to the inference of the perpe- 
tual and universal maintainance of this principle; 
and it is upon the security of it that analogy becomea 
a safe guide in cases beyond the limits of actual 
experience. 

This grand conclusion forms the solid basis on 
which we rest our convictions of the immutability of 
the Divine attributes and counsels. And this is, 
perhaps, of all others the reflection which, to a think- 
ing and philosophic inquirer, tends most to exalt 
his ideas of the Divine ])erfections, — ^the regulation 
of all the varied and complicated actions of the 
material world by an unvarying system ; the combi- 
nation of a limited number of first principles pro- 
ducing all the variety and harmony of the creation ; 
the sufficiency of a few simple laws to regulate the 
entire complexity of the vast mechanism ; the first 
constitution of the w*orld upon a principle whicht

ivithout further interposition, contains within itself 
the means of perpetual renovation and stability. 

Now, this conclusion rests (as we have said,) on 
the collective inferences of a real maintainance of 
inviolable order in the material world. It is evident, 
then, that any event occurring to interrupt the pre- 
servation of this order would be a serious exception 
and formidable difficulty in the way of our conclusion. 

The only escape from it would be in supposing 
that the violation of order was only apparent and not 
real ; that though seeming an exception, it was, in 
truth, not contrary to the rule, — though the rule in 
all its extent was unknown to us ; that the circum- 
stance, apimrently anomalous, was still in accordance 
Avith some recondite system unperceived by us ; that 
our view of the real law was not yet sufficiently 
extensive or complete. Our only course would then 
be to retrace our steps, and attempt the inquiry 
again on better grounds. 

For once imagine that real design and a deter- 
minate law are not somewhere preserved, and we are 
involved in the anarchy of chaos and the darkness of 
atheism ; or suppose that it is not traceable by us, 
and so far to us the prooft are defective ; or admit 
the notion of the enthusiast that all physical con- 
clusions of this sort are the mere offspring of proud 
and overweening human reason, and we are idolaters 
worshipping a Deity who is the creature of our own 
imaginatioii. 

It may be desirable^ therefore^ to recur for a

moment to the consideration of inductive laws in 

general. 

Of the extent to which that regularity may be 
consistent Anth occasional apparent anomaly, it is^ 
perhaps, impossible to convey an adequate idea with- 
out referring to those astonishing instances which are 
afforded by mathematical formulas. But some illua- 
trations of this kind are put in a very luminous and 
popular form by Mr. Babbage in a work already 
referred to. It is, for example, possible, in his cal- 
culating machine, to make such an a^ustment that 
a series of numbers shall be produced in succession 
which are all complete squares ; at, a certain pointy 
one number shall occur which is a cube ; after this^ 
the square numbers shall be resumed, and condnue 
without limit. Tliis exception might bo deemed an 
anomaly, an interruption of the law imposed ; but it 
is really a part and consequence of it Indeed, the 
analytical mathematician can produce many instances 
of formulas which give rise to a series of quantities 
apparently following a certain regular order, but at 
particular points interrupted as it were ; yet again 
resumed and continued ; which are called ' discon- 
tinuous functions.* The original principle is in 
these cases more comprehensive than we should be 
led to suppose from a limited contemplation of its 
results*."

such illustrations iu guiding his Tiews of the order 
of the natural Avorld. Events apparently anoma1ou8» 
and seeming like absolute interruptions of uniformitjt 
may be only so because we have not attained a suf- 
ficiently extended view of the entire system to which 
they really are united as essential and harmonious 
parts. 

And such considerations become of more special 
importance in reference to those sublime conclusions 
of natural theology to which we have just before 
referred. Those who admit them in general may not 
be prepared to perceive the full extent to which they 
hold good. Yet the consideration of apparent excep- 
tions and seeming contradictions, and suggestions, by 
which to resolve the difficulties, are surely most 
important for vindicating our belief in an eternal 
Providence. 



Example$ : — Gratitation. 

Let us take as an example the system of universal 
gravitation. Newton, by establishing the observance 
of unvarying laws throughout the solar system as the 
necessary results of one grand principle, in fitct estsr 
blished the only evidence we can attain of the 
Divine Intelligence ordaining and maintaining that 
system; the unaltered preservation of such lawi^ 
once imposed, being the secondary means in which 
alone we can recognise the operation of Divine 
power. Prior to these discoveries we might have

ima^ned imine<liate arbitrary intervention in eveij 
motion of the planetary bodies. And in any depart- 
ment of pliTsical inquiry the same remark would 
apply. In the one case we might imagine such 
agency, but we could have no rational proof of it ; 
in the other alone do we arrive at the sole means of 
proof of which our limited powers are capable. 

Such has ever been the progress of physical science 
in all its departments ; from confusion to order ; finom 
arbitrary influence to systematic arrangement ; finom 
capricious agency to overruling intelligence. 

These remarks will prepare the reader to take in 
its correct sense an observation of Laplace, which 
has been much dwelt upon, and, as I think, unhap- 
pily misunderstood ; owing, in no small degree, to 
that ambiguity which >ve before noticed in the use of 
the words ** final cause ;** and which, in the sentence 
about to be quoted, are obviously employed as equi* 
valent to the words " direct intervention." 

•* Let us,** says Laplace, ** run over the histoij of 
the progress of the human mind and its errors ; we 
shall ]>eri>etually see ' final causes * pushed away to 
the bounds of its knowledge. These causes, which 
Newton removed to the limits of the solar systemt 
were not long ago conceived to obtiun in the atmo- 
sphere, and employed in explaining meteors; they 
are, therefore, in the eyes of the philosopher nothing 
more than the expression of the ignorance in which 
we are of the real causes.'*

oSer further comment on this passage, the tendency 
of which, when rightly understood, is manifestly so 
far from hostile to the true doctrine of final causes, 
that it points directly to those profoundly adjusted 
arrangements which constitute the TOiy soundest 
proofs of Divino Intelligence pervading the system 
of the universe. 

Pe)iii9*baHans : — Stability of the System. 

Newton developed in the most complete and satis- 
factory manner all the grander features of the system 
of universal gravitation. To that great principle^ 
simple indeed in its law, but wholly mysterious in 
its nature and mode of operation, he successfully 
referred all the more palpable and conspicuous 
motions of the heavenly bodies. Here was, in truth, 
a physical cause of the most universal efficiency, but 
one which he was peculiarly careful to insist on, in 
the sole sense of an universal /act or law: — ^the 
tendency of all matter to fall together with a force 
proportional directly to the mass and inversely to 
the square of the distance. To this physical cause, 
then, he was able to trace all the greater pheno- 
mena of the solar system. 

But it was confessedly the fitct that there existed 
some slight irregularities in the motions of the 
planets; and it was even a consequence of gravi- 
tation that they must act one on another, in a very 
complicated manner, in consequence of their peipe-

tually varying relative positions, and thus disturb the 
perfect regularity of each other^s motion. The inves- 
tigation of those perturbations was not followed up 
by Newton. He was aware of their existence^ and 
that they were but small in amount, and always 
allowed for them in speaking of the exactness with 
which the law of elliptic orbits prevails. He con^ 
ceived, however, that these ** inconsiderable irregu- 
larities which may have arisen from the mutual 
actions of comets and planets upon one another, will 
be apt to increase, till this system wants a reformar- 
tionV 

This remark occurs in a jmssage where he is 
expressly speaking of the order and harmony of the 
system as an indication of design. He had also 
before said, that ** the main business of natural phi* 
losophy is to deduce causes from effects till we come 
to the very first cause, which certainly is not mecha- 
nicalf .*' And again, that from observing the order 
of the visible world, and so inferring creative intel- 
ligence, ** it is unphilosophical to seek for any other 
origin of the world, or to pretend that it might arise 
out of a chaos by the mere laws of nature ; though 
being once formed it may continue by those la^i's for 
many ages^." 

The observation first quoted has, in conjunction 
with these last, been viewed as expressing Newton^s 
belief that the adjustments of the planetary system

vrould need reneTral from time to timo by the imme« 
diate interjiosition of Divine power. And tliis was 
looked upon by many as one of the most valuable 
inferences from tho Newtonian system. From a 
reference to the passage, it will be seen at once that 
Newton does not himself expressly make the infer* 
ence ; nor, when carefully considered, is it one of any 
peculiar importance or force. It is difiicult to see in 
what way (if correct^) it could add to the evidence 
of design afforded In such overwhelming abundance 
by the existing order of the system. 

NeAvton left all the irregularities, or perturbations 
(as they are called,) to be investigated by his succes- 
sors. Tlie most distinguished mathematicians since 
his time' have been occupied in developing and sim- 
plifying these intricate but highly interesting ques- 
tions. Lagrange and Laplace have been pre-emi« 
nently distinguished in this research ; and to the pro- 
found analysis, esj)ecially, of the latter, we owe the 
establishment of the great principle, that all the 
variations which can arise from the mutual actions 
of the planets are limited by certain periods within 
which they must peq)etually recur. This has been 
called ** the stability of the planetary system." 

•* It is not, therefore,** says Baron Fourier, in his 
EHoge of Laplace, '' lefl> as Newton himself and 
Euler had coi\jcctured, to an adventitious force to

detracting from the evidences of Supreme IntelU*

maintenance, of the order of the universe is, of all 
others, the most stupendous manifestatjon of eternal 
Providence.

the supposed necessity for Divine interferenoe^ to

bave been little able to perceive tbe nature or indi- 
cations of such a cause. They have looked for the 
proofs of Omnipotence rather in great changes and 
sudden interpositions, but have not acknowledged 
infinite Intelligence in the continual invariable suc- 
cession of ordinary laws, and the profound acyust- 
ment of all the varied trains of physical effects one 
to another, the preservation of uninterrupted and 
universal harmony among natural phenomena. 

Resisting Medium. 

But though we find the principle of gravitation thus 
perfect within itself, and containing a perpetual 
source of reparation for all disturbances, yet here we 
must not restrict our speculations to the action of 
gravitation alone ; no part of the universe, no phy- 
sical principle must be contemplated in an isolated 
point of view. The consequences of gravitation 
must not be regarded alone without also considering 
other causes by which they may be modified ; and 
the disclosure of the high probability that the pla- 
netary spaces are filled by a medium inconceivably 
rare, yet capable, in an immense lapse of time^ of 
sensibly resisting the motions of the planets, opens 
to our view an extraneous cause which will modify 
the effects resulting from the action of gravitation 
alone. The perturbations may be perpetually com- 
pensated ; but the orbits of all the bodies of the 
system will, by the resistance of the nthereal

medium, take a gradually more and more compressed 
form, (as the range of a projectile is narrowed by 
the resistance of the air,) they will moTO with 
increased Telocity, continually approach the snn in 
nearer gyrations, and at length fall into his mass. 

The lapse of time which will be necessary to 
accomplish this is indeed so incouceiTably immense^ 
that we might well call the stability of the system 
perpetual. The probability of such resistance has 
only been evinced by certain extremely minute 
effects produced on the orbit of that angular and 
scarcely material substance, the periodical comet of 
Enck^, a sort of unsubstantial thing, a mere wisp of 
vapour, which yet obeys the laws of impulse and 
gravity, and revolves about the sun. The aether 
then which offers a resistance barely observable to 
what is little more than an icthereal nebula, it may 
readily be imagined, has failed to produce any eflfect 
on the solid planets capable of being detected, in 
the entire period since the earliest astronomical 
observations. 

It has, indeed, been contended by some able and 
philosophical writers, that there are few condusioiif 
of science which so strongly force upon the mind 
the conviction of a Supreme power as those whidi 
refer to the finite nature of all created things; 
which make the period when the present order of 
nature did not exist, and predict the time when it 
shall cease ; which point to a beginning and an end.

M'liicli are most hidden from our knowledge for tbe 
indications of the Divinity ; to contend that \irhen 
natural causes &il us, ive are, in an especial manner, 
driven to admit direct Divine intervention ; and that 
irhen meclmnical laws apparently cease to apply, 
then we must more peculiarly recognize the domi- 
nion of the Deity. The view which I have been 
here endeavouring to illustrate is precisely the 
reverse. The evidences of the Divine operation 
seem to me manifested precisely in proportion as we 
can trace material laws and physical laws. 

A world enveloped in entire obscurity as to phy- 
sical causes, would, to my apprehension, be a world 
without the evidence of a Deity. An universe 
w*ithout appreciable laws would be a chaos, not a 
creation. And, by parity of reason, in those regions 
of nature, where we are most involved in ignorance^ 
there, is the Deity most hidden from our perceptions. 
And instead of groping in the darker recesses where 
induction has not yet penetrated to find Him, we 
shall more rationally go forth to behold Him in 
those brighter regions which are illumined by dis- 
covered causes and demonstrated lav^ 

Yet so powerful has been the pr^udice to the 
contrary, that not only have the unexplained obsco- 
rities of nature been religiously venerated as the 
penetralia of natural worshij), but it has been held 
dangerous to indulge in the most philosophical coff- 
jectures ; and impious to speculate on causes whicb 
may be most rationally imagined to prevail when we

doing, M-e were profanely penetrating into precincts 
peculiarly consecrated to tbe Deity, and hallowed bj 
bis immediate presence. 



Example : Nature of GratUation. 

We may illustrate this remark by the instance of 
the essential principle of gravity which, in the pre- 
sent state of our knowledge, is wholly enveloped in 
mystery. But do we thence gain any thing in 
favour of final causes, or the belief in Divine agency ? 
On the contrary, if future discoveries should disdoee 
to us the nature of this universally mysterious agent, 
and bring it under the dominion of mechanical laws^ 
we shall obtain so much the higher insight into the 
recondite mechanism of the world, and the more 
striking proofs of the skill of its Divine artificer. 

Such were the sentiments of the most enlightened 
of Newton*s followers even in his own times ; and 
when, in the controversy to which his discoveries 
were at first exposed, the absurd accusation was 
urged by bis continental opponents, that by pushing 
the physical explanations of phenomena beyond due 
bounds, the philosopher unwarrantably intruded into 
the region of primary causation, (according to the 
confused idea, so commonly prevalent, of their rela- 
tive nature,) the reply of Dr. S. Clarke, (than whom 
no one was better able to see the theological bear- 
ing of the case^) was simply, ^ Si M. Leibnits ou

Aggregation of Matter. 

To TAKE another example of those phenomena of 
the universe, which have not been reduced to mecha- 
nical causes, we may cite that which is dwelt upon 
by Newton in the following passage : ^ If the matter 
of the sun and planets was evenly disposed through- 
out an infinite space, it would never convene into 
one mass ; but some of it would convene into 
one mass, and some into another, so as to make an 
infinite number ofmasscs^ scattered at great distances 
from one to another throughout all the infinite 
space. And thus might the sun and thefi^cd stars be 
formed^ supposing the matter were of a lucid nature. 
But how the matter should divide itself into two 
sorts : and that part of it which is fit to compose a 
shining body should fall down into one mass and 
make a sun ; and the rest, which is fit to compose 
an opaque body, should coalesce, not into one great 
body, like the shining matter, but into many little 
ones : or if the sun were at first an opaque body 
like the planets, or the planets lucid bodies like the 
sun, how he alone should be changed into a shining 
body, whilst all they continue opaque ; or, all they 
be changed into opaque ones, whilst he remains

unchanged ; / do not think^e^plicaile hj/ mere natural 
causes^ but nm forced to ascribe it to the counsel and 
contricance of a voluntary ayent^.^ 

Such was the cotyecture of Newton in accordance 
with the existing state of philosophical views. He 
considered the phenomena ** not explicable by mere 
natural causes," and therefore had recourse to a 
supernatural cause. But supposing the case allowed 
to be thus unexplained by any knoAvn natural causes^ 
we have still to observe that it would ofTord no more 
evidences of supernatural agency than simply that 
which is furnished by the observed yhcfo of the adap- 
tation of the masses and respective physical con- 
ditions of the sun and of the planets to each other ; 
and this evidence is unaltered whether the observed 
fact can be accounted for or not. And if it could 
be accounted for on any known physical principle^ 
^ so far from detracting from the manifestation of 
design, this would only the more augment our 
impression of \\1dely-i)ervading skill and recondite 
adjustment throughout the planetary world. But 
though we should admit that no cause has been 
assigned, it would be manifestly contrary to eveiy 
principle of the inductive philosophy to affim that 
none can or will be. 

AVhen, therefore, we find Laplace suggesting what 
is, after all, professedly but a conjecture as to the 
l)robable course, merely, which inquiiy might pro-

perlj take on such a question, it ought neither to 
be regarded (as it has been,) as an im\rarrantable 
extension of philosophical analogy, nor dreaded (as 
in some instances,) as in the least degree hostile to 
the argument for design ; so &r from this, if verified, 
it would but enhance the value of that argument. 
He, in feet, simply suggests, ** amid these uncertain- 
ties the wisest course would be to devote ourselves 
to determining, by repeated experiments, the laws 
of affinity, in order to arrive at what would appear 
the simplest means of comparing these forces with 
that of gravitation." 

If any law of affinity should ever be developed to 
such an extent as in any degree to meet the object 
here in view, (and we can never say that discovery 
may not be carried so &r,) the only result surely 
would be the most overpowering conviction of the 
extension of the same vast unity of design through- 
out the mechanism of the material system. 

The Nebtdar Hypothesis. 

Closely connected with this last case is the ^ nebu- 
lar hypothesis,'* as it has been called, which has in a 
more peculiar degree, called forth the censures and 
obloquy of those who were intent on allowing no 
secondary means as the instruments or channels of 
the influence of creative power. 

The luminous band called the ** milky way,** is 
resolved, by powerful telescopes, into a vast multitude 




\\

of stars crowded together in infinitelj lengthened 
persi)ective, and constituting an immense system of 
sidereal matter of an extended flat form, within 
which our planetary system is included, and of which 
our sun is merely one of the innumerable stars which 
make up the entire mass. 

In various parts of the heavens the telescope dis- 
closes to us patches of diffused luminous matter 
called ** nebulae,* bearing a general resemblance in 
appearance to the milky way as seen by the naked 
eye. Some of these are found by very powerfnl 
telescopes to condst of numerous stars^ mostlj 
appearing in the midst of a mass of diffused light. 
In some cases, the starry points are brilliant and 
defined ; in others, more diffused, or merely points 
of greater luminous intensity than the surrounding 
region. Calculation assures us of the inconcdvable 
distance from us beyond which they are situatedt 
and measurement by consequence teaches us their 
enormous magnitude : so vast, that in many of them 
not only the solar system, but the whole mass of the 
milky way to which it belongs, would be lost. Hint 
we find, as far as observation can be carried into the 
vastness of the universe, besides distinct stars^ an 
infinity of other systems of stellar matter, in the 
form of these ^ nebulK,** dispersed through spacer 
and of which our entire system, included in the 
** nebula** to which it belongs, forms but one of the 
most insignificanft.

diflusion in \r1iich these various nebulas, with tlieir 
stellar points, appear to exist. 

So far exact observation has led us to the admis* 
sion of facts which, however overwhelming to our 
conceptions, are nevertheless beyond questioiu Now 
philosophical conjecture has been applied to these 
facts; and, upon veiy reasonable analogjj astrono- 
mers have indulged in the contemplation of these 
different forms in which sidereal matter is presented 
to us, as exhibiting so many different stages in the 
progress of the formation of sidereal systems. 

In the first instance, such matter seems to assume 
the form of a faint diffused nebulosity. In the next, 
some of these masses appear as if, in obedience to 
attractive forces, they had assumed a spherical figure ; 
others, as if further advanced, have a denser centra! 

nucleus, surrounded by the more diffuse and yet 
uncondensed portion ; others again, (to use the words 
of an eminent writer,) ^ in which the apparently 
unformed and irregular mass of nebulous light is just 
curdling^ as it were, into separate systems.'* And 
further, there are some in a more complete con- 
dition, presenting a congeries of distinct points of 
light, each, perhaps, the sun of a system more vast 
and glorious than our own, but invidble to us; 
whilst in the case of the actual systems of double 
and triple stars, whose motions have been actually 
observed and calculated, we find the exact counter- 
parts of our own planctaiy world, which have arrived 
at a corresponding point in the history of their eon-

stitntion, as also probably is tbe case vitb tbe other 
fixed stars. 

Analogical conjecture, then, has been broached 
(under the name of the nebular hypothesis,) to illus- 
trate the process of the formation of our own system 
by what we behold iu its different, and probably suo* 
cessive stages in other cases. It has been imagined 
that our system has been gradually evolved and con<» 
densed out of the nebula to which it belongs, and 
each of its planetary masses gradually consolidated 
from a previous state of expanded nebulosity. And 
this idea is further strengthed from the consideration 
of the probable high temperature from which our 
globe is believed to have cooled down to its present 
condition, and consequently to have undeigone pro* 
gressive condensation. While we have again the 
analogy of comets ; nebulous masses of extremely 
attenuated matter, yet existing as parts of our sys- 
tem ; and still further, what recent observation has 
rendered very probable, vast quantities of unconso* 
lidated particles and small masses of matter travers- 
ing space, and occasioning the phenomena of aero* 
lites and meteoric stones. 

Such elevated ideas as these views are calculated 
to suggest, it might bo supposed would be among 
those which, above all others, religious minds would 
be prone to cherish and delight in, more especially 
as carrying us a step towards a conception of the 
Creator's operations; yet, from some perversion 
which it is difficult to comprehend, no hypothesis

Argument from Physical to Moral Causation. 

From \7hat lias been advanced, the proper course 
of our reasoning on tbese elevated subjects will be 
evident. 

In physical science let us direct our inquiries to 
the contemplation of the order, arrangement, ' and 
adjustment among natural facts and laws, which we 
infer by legitimate induction. Let us keep the 
terms of our reasoning distinct and explicit, and 
conduct our sublimest speculations solely by an 
extended, but whoUjf independent collection of the 
universal manifestation of design and prospective 
arrangement, from the mere naked investigation of 
physical laws and causes. Wlien such inferences 
have been carefully made, — when such indications 
have been dispassionately collected, then, in the 
order of just reasoning, we can advance to the sub- 
lime contemplations suggested by such evidences. 
This distinction, so often unheeded, is in feet the 
chief ground of Bacon's* reply to the censures cast 
on his system as neglecting the study of final causes,

and which has been reiterated bjr some modem 
writers. 

What he objects to is the violation of all correct 
order of reasoning by assumify the theological view 
of final causes in physical inquiries, where it should 
be the very thing to be deduced andprwed. 

The fault to be guarded against is that of taking 
any metaphysical notions of final causes, any refer- 
ence to moral causation, as the basis and guide of 
physical theories. In proportion as we do this we 
vitiate the conclusions of natural theology by an 
argument in a circle. We assume the point to be 
proved. This was precisely the error of Descartes 
and his school. From assumed metaphysical ideas 
of the Deity and his attributes they affected to reason 
downwards to the deduction of the laws and pheno- 
mena of nature. ** It is manifest,** says Descartes, 
** that M*e shall follow the best way of philosophiidng 
i^ from the knowledge of God himself, we endeavour 
to deduce the knowledge of the things created by 
Him — ^that thus we may attain the most perfect kind 
of science, the knowledge of effects from thdr 
causes *•** He was accused of neglecting ''final 
causes.** The fact was, in one sense, the conside- 
ration of them was in his system superfluous; in 
another, the whole theory consisted of nothing else. 

This system was charged with having an atheistic

tendency. In one sense, this \ras palpably nntrae» 
as the ii'hole of it was built on the supposition of the 
Divine attributes ; in another, it might be open to 
the accusation if it be allowed that a system is inju- 
rious to the cause of religion which destroys and 
confounds all rational evidence of its truth. This 
remark may not be destitute of application even at 
the present day. The system of Descartes, as such, 
has now no adherents; but there are reasoners of 
several schools who Ml into precisely the mistake 
here exposed^. 

Thus then it is that the study of physical causa 
(understood in the simple meaning which we have 
before endeavoured to fix,) while it supplies the 
unassailable evidence of design and adjustment, aa 
unavoidably carries us thence onward to the idea of 
an Intelligence from which that design emanated, 
and of an agency by which that adjustment was pro- 
duced. It brings us, in a word, to recognise an 
influence of another kind, of an order different from^ 
and far above that of physical causes or material 
action : — ^to acknowledge a sublime moral causCf the 
universally operating source of creative power and 
providential wisdom. But we grasp these truths 
only in their proofs and manifestations. Of the 
mode of influence or operation we are wholly and 
necessarily ignoraxit ; even in ordinary cases of moral 
agents within the scope of our observation we fail

entirely in conceiving tbe mode in which mind can 
influence matter; much more then must this be the 
case with regard to the unseen and infinite moral 
cause of tho system of the universe. 

Secondmy Causes^ and ike First Oauie. 

By such considerations as those above adduced on 
sound and unexceptionable groundSi we establish the 
momentous and elevated truth, of one great moral 
cause of all things ; and in this sense* as referring 
to the idea of designing wisdom and infinite intelli- 
gence, we perceive the wide distinction between the 
use of the term ^ cause," and that adopted w*hen we 
speak of secondary or physical ** causes.** 

We have already noticed, in other cases, the ambi« 
guities arising from the diversity of meaning attached 
to the same term ^ cause.** Here, then, it becomes 
more peculiarly necessary if we adopt the popular 
expression, •* the First Cause,** to recur carefully to 
the distinction, if w*e would preserve any clearness 
of reasoning. 

We refer to senses of the term absolutely distinct 
in kind. Nor is it a term of mere verbal difference. 
It is of importance, whether in guarding against fiil- 
lacies in evidence or in answering the cavils of scep- 
ticism. 

Now, the result of our inquiiy into the nature of 
physical causes was such as to carry our ideas rather to 
the extension of order and nnifoimity than to the mo-

phyrical laws or causes. And when we ascend to 
the contemplation of creative intelligence, the dis- 
tinction is not between a prior and a subsequent 
train of material action^ but between physical order 
and moral volition.. 

It will thus be apparent that the metaphortso often 
used of the chain of natural causes whose last and 
highest link is its immediate connexion with the 
Deity ; — ^the very phrase of a succession of secondary 
causes traced up to a Jlrst cause, — and the like, (so 
commonly employed,) are founded on a totally mis- 
taken analogy. They refer to a mere succession of 
mechanical impulses, traced up to a first mechanical 
power ; to a series of physical changes, referred suc- 
cessively to some more and more general physical 
principle. The adoption of such a mode of repre- 
sentation when extended to the Deity would seem 
to make the first cause but one of a continued series 
of physical causes, and differing from them only in 
order of priority or generality. It would confound 
the efficient intelligence with the mere material 
manifestation of it, — the Creator with the creation. 

If we retain such metaphorical language at all, it 
would be a more just mode of speaking to describe 
the Deity as the Divine artificer of the whole chain, 




TO NATURAL THBOLOOT. 



181 



— not to connect liim with its links ; — to represent 
the secondary causes as combined into joint operation 
by his power and will, — ^but not to make Him one 
of them. 

But the common figures, besides thdr manifest 
impropriety, are singularly ill adapted to place before 
our view the most important part of Hie trnth, nay, 
are even calculated to hide and disgmae it. For by 
the fomiliar use of these phrases Uie mind is habi- 
tually diverted from the conrideiatiim that this 
'* chain,** a portion of which we can handle and 
examine, is to be so examined to teadi us the dciU 
of the artificer ; and instead of this we are led away 
to the irrelevant consideration of where the end of it 
may be fixed. 

It then surely will be allowed <^ no small import- 
ance to preserve carefully the distinction between 
moral and physical causation. It is by this distinc- 
tion that we advance from mere phyrical relations to 
any inference of a higher order of things. It is this 
M'hich elevates our ideas from the mere material 
elements to the recondite intelligenee which per- 
vades the harmonious arrangement of theuL 

If we require the aid of metaj^or in attempting 
to give utterance to those vast ocmoeptions with 
which the mind is overpowered, instead of speaking 
of the first and secondary links in a dbain of canssp 
tion, and the like, let us rather reenr to the analogj

and shall here run no risk of speaking as if we con- 
founded the stones with the builder, — ^their mutually

ac^usted them. 

Tliese considerations may enable us, then, to per- 
ceive the entire futility of those objections which are 
often urged against the study of secondary causes as 
being injurious to our due apprehension and acknow- 
ledgment of the first cause ; — so fiur from it they, in 
fact, furnish the sole rational or natural means of 
leading us to that apprehension and acknowledg-

Argument from Design to LUelligence. 

We have thus far referred only, in a very general 
sense, to the notion we form of the great source of 
design and order in nature, or, in popular language^ 
the First Cause, or Supreme Intelligence. In a more 
precise sense it may become a question, how fiir is 
this language and this inference borne out by any 
conclusions of our unaided reasoning powers? 
Firom the regularity, permanence, and universality

of physical catisation, wo conclado the existence of a 
moral causation: from tUo manifestations of order 
and purposo, we infer an ordaining and designing 
mind. That these are tuUural inferences and ideas 
almost unavoidably occurring to U8» is perfectly true ; 
but tho very point of inquiry in natural theology is 
the growul of the inference and the analysis of the 
natural impression. 

Now, it has been contended by some professed 
friends to religion, that beyond the bare fact of order 
and fitness we can really infer nothing by the mere 
powers of reason; and that the conclusion of an 
independent intelligent supreme existence, if it be 
anything more than a mere truism, is a vain pre* 
sumption ; that in one sense, it is mere tautology to 
say, that design implies a designer; or else, in another 
sense, idle to suppose that our finite reason can teach 
us anything of the purposes or nature of an Infinite 
Being*. 

Now, the bare &ct of order and arrangement is 
on all hands undisputed, though commonly most 
inadequately understood and appreciated. 

The inference of design, intention, forethought^ 
is something beyond the last mentioned trutht' and 
not to be confounded toith it. This implies intelU** 
gent agency, or moral causation. Hence again» we 
advance to the notion of distinct existence, or whiA 
is sometimes called personality ; and thence proceed

to ascribe the other Divine attributes and perfections 
as centering in that independent Being. 

Such probably would be the distribution of our 
thoughts as successively pursued, if we proceeded to 
any systematic analysis of our reasonings on the 
subject. It is not, perhaps, a species of examination 
to which many are inclined, even of those who take 
delight in the general contemplation of the truths 
with which they are impressed by the examination 
of the natural world. 

Yet a careful consideration of the orderly series of 
simple elements into which we can analyze our con- 
ceptions, is of eminent use (even though we do not 
practically and habitually go through such a process 
every time we think on the subject). It enables us 
as well to assure ourselves of the validity of our own 
conceptions, as to detect the Mlacies of sceptical 
objections. 

Now here I conceive we shall have no need to 
enter upon any abstruse or difficult discussion. I 
believe it will suffice to elucidate the subject, if we 
simply look to the use of language. In analyzing 
the train of inferences or ideas referred to, the con- 
^deration of the origin and precise meaning of the 
term$ we employ appears to me most vitally essen- 
tial, and yet most commonly overlooked; while, 
from the neglect of it, most of the misapprehensions 
which prevail on the subject take their rise. 

We observe the indications of mind displayed in 
the works produced by the moral causation of Toinn-

tary agents and intelligent beings witbin tbe scope 
of our observation. We follow up an analogjf 
between these and the vast manifestations exhibited 
in the order of nature; and from this andogy we 
attempt, however inadequately, to express our limited 
and imperfect conceptions of the infinite and incom- 
prehensible moral cause of the universal order and 
system of natural causes. 

Tlie same remark applies to the further inference 
of the distinct cjcistcnce of the source of moral causar 
tion, our whole notion of which seems to depend on 
our idea of the relation of moral causation to mind, 
in the cases within our experience. The metaphy- 
sical notions which seem to be involved will, I 
believe, be found to resolve themselves into the same 
simple consideration of the use of terms applied by 
analogy from what we experience in ourselves and in 
beings about us. This I conceive will, on reflection, 
be found the clue which will safely guide us through 
at least a large portion of the intricacies of the sub- 
ject. Considerations of this kind, however, are vitally 
necessary to the argument of natural theology ; and 
this portion of the subject, involving what has been 
termed **the psychological argument,** is beyond 
question most essential to an exact and philosophical 
discussion, though certainly not placed in a suffici- 
ently prominent light, if regarded at all, by some of 
the most excellent and popular writers*.

The Divine Supremacy. 

We may hero observe further, that if we retain the 
popular ktnguage, and speak of the Jirst cause and se^ 
coiidafy causes, wo must, at all events, bear in mind 
that the term ^ first," is relative. We cannot extend 
our conclusions beyond our evidence. It is entirely 
from our investigation of ^* secondary," or physical 
causes, that we can recognise the sublime moral 
cause which ordered them all. It is thus manifest 
that we can properly attach no other idea to the term 
** first cause," than one which is simply relative to 
these ^ secondary causes." Natural theology cannot 
lead us to any higher inference. Nor is it any 
reproach to this science that it does not enable us to 
proceed beyond the limits of its OAvn province ; nor 
to answer the question sometimes propounded in 
this form of illustration: ''The examination of a 
watch leads us to infer a watchmaker, but it cannot 
answer the further question, who made the watch- 
maker*?" Yet this question has been made the 
subject of much misapjirehension and objectioiit 
miunly, as appears to me, from want of reflection*and 
caution in the use of words ; or, perhaps after all» 
rather from some feeling of offence taken at the

mere form and terms in which the iQostratioii has 
been propounded. 

Throngliout the utmost extent of our inyestiga- 
tion of physical causes, wo trace the proofs of that 
moral volition which is prior and superior to them 
all ; proofs exhibited alike throughout all the yast* 
ncss and all the minuteness of the universe; in* 
creasing and augmenting in overwhelming multi- 
plicity, with no other limit than that imposed on the 
extent of our observations and inductions. As far 
as science has reached, and in whatever direction, 
wo still discover this same moral cause ; transcendant 
in a supremacy co-extensive with the creation ; sole 
in dominion to all the extent of known worlds ; and 
continually exhibited to us one and the same, bj 
every new extension of knowledge, every fresh 
incursion of science into hitherto unknown regions. 
And this constitutes our inductive ground of belief 
in what we term the mpremacy of the same one 
moral cause and source of the entire order of phy- 
sical causes ; the first relatively to them ; a Divine 
power supreme to m and to all created beings. 



The Divine Unity. 

The unity of the great designing Intelligenoe has 
been commonly inferred from the observed unity of 
the design. But objections, as to the insufficiency 
of the proof, have been adduced. Such o1gectioii% 
however, it appears to me, can only be entertained

from a want of that comprehensive stndj of physical 
philosophy which alone can convey any adequate 
conception of the vast and overwhelming evidences 
of that unity of plan and harmony of purpose which 
pervades the utmost limits of the known creation. 

Let it be observed tlmt the belief in the Divine 
unity has advanced with the advance of sound induc- 
tive science. The ancient philosophers^ though they 
collected ^oc^f, were wanting in compidiensive indue^ 
tioH. They reached to just conclndons within the 
narrow limits of certain isolated classes of ftcts. 
But they had no principles of analogy to connect 
one class of ftcts with another. They imagined 
nature in general to be given up to almost total 
anarchy ; and the universe, an arena for the perpe^ 
tual combat of conflicting elements. With this 
deficiency in their apprehension of the relations of 
physical causes, it is hardly matter of surprise that 
they admitted a plurality of gods, or an unlimited 
number of powers and agencies, whether subordinate 
or independent. 

But the introduction of a more just philosophy 
has entirely exploded all such vain imaginations. 
The inductive method has applied the key to open 
to us a view of the sublime but simple order of 
natural causes. And from that universal and un- 
ceasing unity of plan in the laws of physical action 
has been derived our rational proof of the unity of 
the Deity. 

Nevertheless it has been urged that unity of plan

might result from the co-o])eration of several minds^ 
powers, or agencies*. But to suppose manj causes^ 
when one will suffice, is clearlj unphilosophical ; 
and besides this, the objection, however plausible, 
when stated merely in an abstract form, will vanish 
the moment we reflect on the actual case of the 
material creation. When we consider, especially 
on the grounds adduced in the previous portion of 
these remarks, the immense multiplicity of physical 
arrangements, all so admirably harmonizing together; 
the infinite combifuttion of adjustments, each arranged 
in exact relation to the other, as well as complete 
within itself; we cannot but feel overwhelmed with 
the conviction that to one Omniscient mind alone 
can be correctly attributed such infinite forethought, 
and such boundless comprehensiveness of arrange- 
ment. 



Objections to the Study of Secondary Cau$e$. 

To the neglect of such simple distinctions as those 
wo have been engaged in illustrating, and from mis- 
conception (mainly caused by ambiguity of terms,) 
as to the nature of physical causes, and the relation 
in which they stand to the Divine Intelligence which 
has constituted them, may be traced most of those 
objections and prejudices which prevail with regard 
to the tendency of physical studies and the inqniiy 
into secondary causes. 

* See Inmt On Fimei OinMt, p. 134. 







190 BELATION OF PHYSICAL SCIENCS 

We hear much alledged against the studj of phj« 
sieal causes, as having, at best, a tendency little con- 
geiual to religious reflections, and even hostile and 
injurious to its spirit By confining the attention (it 
is commonly said,) to the investigation of secondary 
causes, the thoughts are habitually ^nthdraivn from 
the first cause. 

But such objections only furnish, in fiEU^t, instances 
of the confusion of ideas from the ambiguous use of 
the term ** cause.** And they immediately disappear 
\rhen we come to distinguish the meaning correctly. 

Even if the allegation were true that this dissocia* 
tion of ideas is encouraged, what does it amount to 
but an accusation that we M'ithdraw our thoughts 
from the conclusion in order to pursue the frooft 
AVhat is it but the absurd charge that by giving our 
attention solely to the etxdeiioe^ we indispose our 
minds for the inference f 

Scientijic Details. 

Prejudices against the minute investigation of 
nature as an unworthy and trifling pursuit, have not 
unfrcquently been entertained by those who were 
profoundly ignorant of the object and tendency of 
such pursuits, and of the necessity of such precise 
inquiry for establishing the conclusions of all sound 
philosophy. The cultivators of science have often 
been condemned to hear such aspersions cast upon 
their labours^ And to see the genuine spirit in

191 



wbich they were answered, vre may cite the testi- 
mony of the illustrious father of British astronomyy 
\rh09 upon a suspicion that his sublime pursuits were 
treated with ridicule, (in a letter to Newton,) 
expresses his wonder that these occupations should 
be ** looked on as trifling. . . Other persons (he says,) 
that come after me will think their time as little 
mispent in these studies as those did who have 
gone before me. The works of the Eternal Provi* 
dence, I hope, M'ill be a little better understood 
through your labours and mine, than they were for- 
merly ; think me not proud for this expresdon ; I 
look on pride as the worst of sins, humility as the 
greatest virtue*.** 

And the sentiment so nobly avowed by Boyle^ 
when taxed with the childishness of his occupation 
in watcliing the coloura of soap-bubbles, deserves to 
be ever borne in mind as well by those who cultivate^ 
as those who cavil at physical inquiry; ** nothing 
can be unworthy of being investigated by man 
which was thought worthy of being created by 

Godf.- 

But science is often assailed with the charge of 
being wholly conversant with objects of sense^ and 
that, confining us to the world of matter, it restrains 
and disables the mind from the more worthy and 
elevating pursuit of moral and spiritual truth.

objects of sense, those very objects form the steps 
by which we ascend to the evidence of mind ; if 
natural philosophy be conversant solely with the 
Aisible creation, it is by the light of that which is 
visible tliat its true disciple penetrates beyond those 
limits into the presence of Him who is invisible. 

When, therefore, we hear the assertion (so sacred 
in the eyes of many,) that experiment can never 
carry us beyond the region of matter; that by 
physical induction we can never attain to truth in 
its legitimate and only valuable sense; and that 
*' all real philosophy radiates from the knowledge of 
God ;" in such declamation it is diflScult to discover 
any thing but a hopeless confusion of thought, most 
commonly assisted by a thorough ignorance of the 
nature of inductive science, and a total misconcep- 
tion of the very aim and character of philosophical 
inquiry. 

Or again, they contend that ** natural theology is 
entirely founded upon vain curiosity and profitless 
speculations concerning the intentions of God;** 
and are loud in their condemnation of the arrogance 
which would lead a finite mind to attempt to com- 
prehend the counsels of the Infinite ; blind entirely 
to the hd that no such attempt is ever made, no 
such object aimed at ; since, in inferring desipi^ the 
inquirer is always foremost to confess his inability to 
trace its indications to the smallest extent beyond 
the limits which actual inductive evidence warrants.

The Pride of Science. 

NoTHiNO is more common tban to bear persons 
ignorant of physical science enlarging upon what 
they term the arrogance of the philosopher in 
drawing his conclusions, and pretending to deter* 
mine what is, and what must be, in regions utterly 
beyond the limits of sensible experience; nothing 
more usual than to meet with those who talk not 
only with disbelief, but with ridicule, of the theories 
of the scientific pedant; and in the most solemn 
tone, declaim against the pride of reason and phi- 
losophy as essentially hostile to the humility of 
faith. They seem to regard the speculations of phy- 
sical science as mere fancies, in which the philo- 
sopher indulges for the sole gratification of his own 
wayward presumption, and in virtue of which he 
may assume a claim to the admiration of the Tulgar. 
Little considering that these very speculations afford 
the only legitimate and substantial ground on whidi 
a reasoning inquirer can build his most sublime 
proofs of the existence and attributes of the Divine 
Being, — ^that those very theories are nothing dse 
than the expression and the embodying of that aD- 
pervading analogy and order in which the universal 
manifestations of the Divine mind are disclosed 
tons.

extent. The only real presumption is in tbe de- 
liarture from sound inductive principles, and the 
attempt to interpret nature without their aid. In- 
ductive research undoubtedlj claims the right of an 
absolutely unlimited extent of inference, even when 
it points to objects too vast or too minute^ too 
remote in space, or too deep in the abyss of time, to 
come at all within the grasp of our £Eumlties. Tbe 
sole consideration it regards is the accuracy and 
truth of its evidence ; if this be in the first instance 
firmly established, the true philosopher will never 
shrink frx>m admitting all its necessary consequeneei^ 
however inconceivable may be their nature^ and 
incalculable tbeir extent. 

If there were any reasonableness in prescrilung 
such limits, if there were any real ground of doubt 
as to the universal preservation of the analogies of 
nature, it must be carefully observed that any sucb 
limitation would amount, in its direct consequences^ 
to a limitation in those inferences on which we frame 
all our notions of the Deity ; any such ground of 
doubt would (as fiir as it went,) tend to discredit our 
proofr of the Divine perfections. 

If tbe deductions of science are unwanantaUe 
intrusions of the vain imagination of the self-suffl* 
dent phllQ9opber into those vast regions of ereatioii 
which are purposely veiled from us^ the olgecton 
seem to forget that, by necessary consequence^ they 
make tbe sublime conclusions of natural theology 
also aa unwamntable stretch of inference. If tbej

attach the chai^ge of presumption to the speeulatioiia 
of natural science, it must be remembered thef 
thereby attach the same accusation to the deductiims 
of natural theology. If they condemn the condo* 
sions of physical reasoning as arrogant and impiooa 
intrusions of human self-conceit into mysteries 
beyond the reach of the human fiiculties, so^ by 
necessary consequence, they involve in the same 
condemnation the inferences M'hich are dependent 
upon those researches, the belief in the infinite per- 
fection, the unlimited immensity, power, and etemitj 
of the Deity. 

To some it is a peculiarly favourite topic, that die 
powers of the human mind are but limited; that 
there are mysteries in nature which must for ever 
baffle the most acute research ; and, not content with 
the assertion that there are such boundaries imposed 
on all human speculation, are prone to affirm that the 
boundary has been reached whenever they meet with 
an unexplained phenomenon. They seem to dwdl 
with special satisfaction on the circumstance that 
here is an instance of some natural wonder, in the 
comprehension of which the greatest philosopher is 
OS much at a loss as the ignorant peasant Sudi 
instances they often hold out as instructive and 
salutary checks to the pride of science, and humill* 
ating to the pretendons of intellectual superiori^*

judice» in which self-satisfied ignorance consoles

But to those who rightly estimate at once the real 
powers of the human mind and the true character of 
the inductive metliod, it will be manifest how irrar 
tional such sentiments must be. So long as we 
follow diligently, and with becoming caution, the 
humble, but sure path of induction, we can never 
arrive at any bar to our inquiries except those which 
are imposed by the deficiency of focts ; and we know 
by the testimony of all past experience, that the 
disclosure of new facts is daily advancing, and must 
perpetually accumulate. It is by the continual 
accession of fresh phenomena that new paths will 
be perpetually opening to judicious induction ; and, 
by consequence, we may unhesitatingly anticipate 
perpetually new and extended manifestations of order 
and arrangement in nature, of Divine power, wis- 
dom, and beneficence. 

To indulge, then, in the low and absurd reflections 
just adverted to, is nothing else than to rejoice in 
the deficiency of proofs of the Divine perfections. It 
is to delight in blindness to the manifestations of 
Divine power and goodness; to prefer darkness to 
light, and to evince a disposition of congenial cha- 
racter. It is to refuse to recognise the proper and 
highest use for which our intellectual fiEiculties are 
conferred upon vm.

Intei*posHion : — Permanent Law$. 

The notion of physical cause and effect being redaced 
to a bare ** sequence^** has been strongly objected to 
as ii\jurious to the belief in the Divine agency in 
nature ; and the supposition of an acting efficient 
cause in every natural phenomenon, has been empha- 
tically insisted on as necessary for the support of 
that doctrine. But from the view we have here 
taken of the nature of physical causes, and thdri 
relation to moral, we see that, so far from snpport-j 
ing, the supposition of such direct perpetual inter-! 
vention would, in fact, invalidate the evidence of 
a First Cause. 

According to the view here supported of the nature 
of physical causes, it has sufficiently appeared that» 
in including in our idea the relation of the more par- 
ticular to the more general fact, we have assigned 
the origin of our ideas of the closest and most inse- 
parable union of cause and effect ; and this relation 
is obviously dependent upon the degree in which we 
can generalize among the phenomena of nature; 
that is, upon the degree in which we can trace order 
and arrangement. Thus, the greater the extent to 
which we can trace physical causes, in this senses 
the more surely founded is the inference of moral 
.«on and all-powerful intelligence^ derived from 
the contemplation of this order of causes. 

And Avhen we reflect upon the unbounded vastnest

of nature, which expands under our examination, and 
which receives enlargement continually from every 
additional advance which the practical application of 
science confers on the perfection of our senses, — 
when we find the same beauty and uniformity pre- 
served throughout the utmost range of our obser- 
vations, — and when we add, that all this is but a 
small speck in the actual immensity of the universe 
— ^we surely derive the highest posdble proofs and 
indications of recondite and perfect adjustment 
through the extent of the visible world: so that 
we can but by feeble and dim analogies, most imper- 
fectly express our partial apprehension of a presiding 
and all-pervading Divine Intelligence. Again, if we 
turn from the consideration of space to that of time, 
it is only by deciphering the monuments of the 
immense periods of successive organization,' up to 
the epoch of the first existence of animal life, that 
we leam the testimony of nature to the fact of 
creation, or rather succession of creations; and, in 
conformity with our limited conceptions, speak of 
the infinite wisdom and skill of the Divine Intelli- 
gence, the infinite power of the creating Deity. 

Unless we consent to reason from the analogy of 
known causes to those which are unknown, — ^from 
the present to the remotest epochs of the past, we 
must lose the whole argument from the continuance 
of order and arrangement ; we must be deprived of 
our sublimest conclusions which result from the per- 
manence of the indications of design and harmontooi

adaptation. If we could trace material action no 
further than to resolve every effect into the result 
of an immediate arbitrary intervention, the real 
evidences of Divine intelligence would be wanting. 

We thus perceive the futility of such chaiges, as 
that by establishing the uniformity of second causes 
we impair the evidence of the Divine interposition ; 
that by extending our researches into nature we 
encroach on the dominion of the Sovereign of 
nature ; and that by enlai^ng the range of physical 
agency we detract from the majesty of the Divine 
power ; whereas it is by these very researches that 
we establish and acknowledge His sovereignty, and 
find in that very agency nothing else than His dele- 
gated authority. 

As reasonably should we construe the tranquillity 
of a well-ordered community into a proof of the 
defective energy of the sovereign power, because the 
daily immediate manifestation and interposition of 
that power was not necessary to cany on the govern- 
ment. As well might we consider it to detract from 
the perfection of a piece of machinery, that it did not 
require the perpetual interposition of the artificer to 
keep it in action*.

the results of physical inquiry, \\ith one consent, all 
point to the existence of recondite principles of 
arrangement throughout nature, of vast and uni- 
versal design. Every separate instance of adjust- 
ment does this by the evidences it contains within 
itself But the wonderful combination and multi- 
plication of such evidence can only be appreciated 
from the extended comparison of general laws, and 
the analogies by which those laws are related. This 
supplies the most powerfully accumulating proof of 
ordaining Intelligence and Almighty Mind. 

The inconceivable minuteness on the one hand, 
and the immense extent on the other, to which we 
find these analogies still accurately preserved, are, 
perhaps, of all other considerations, the most effica- 
cious in impressing us with the notion of the Divine 
perfections. The unbroken continuation of the same 
order and analogy, whether throughout time or 
space, joined with the consideration that all this is 
but finite, is the reflection which, above every other, 
must inspire us with the most truly exalted notions 
of the Divine immensity and eternity. 

From such considerations we may, perhaps, better 
appreciate the real office of inductive philosophy, 
and the nature of the service it discharges as minis- 
tering to the sublime truths of natural theology. 
The existence of some universal principles of ana- 
logy and uniformity is the gromid of all inductive 
science. The tradng out of such analogies through 
all their actual physical indications, is that whidi

201 



furnishes tho great aigmneDt of natoral theologj. 
And we acknowledge that this preservation of uni- 
fomiitj and analogy, (which we have seen supplies 
the natural preliminary conjecture in all induction*) 
is, in foct, tlic very indication of the universal pre- 
sence and all-pervading energy of the one Divine 
mind. Thus, then, these momentous and sublime 
conclusions rest upon a common basis with those of 
inductive science, and thus invest science with the 
high sanction of their own sacred character. Esta- 
blished by physical research, they react upon it; 
they supply the most elevated motive for the prose- 
cution of the study of nature; and the glorious 
truths which manifest themselves as we proceed, 
cast back a lustre on the imth by which we have 
advanced, and encourage the endeavour to approach 
their Eternal source. 

So fSEir from any advantage arising to the stability 
of natural religion, or any augmentation of force to 
the impressions of natural piety, when nature remains 
veiled in mystery, and we are compelled to own our 
ignorance of the modes and laws of her operations^ 
it is, in fact, the very unveiling of those mysteries^ 
the dispersion of that mist of ignorance, the dis- 
closure of the secrets of phydcal causation, whidi 
supply the very proof and defence of the truths of 
natural theology. The acknowledgment of Supreme 
power and wisdom, instead of being banished from

inductive investigation, is there pre-eminently esta- 
blished as in its more peculiar sovereignty. 

And it is in the very advance from what has been 
termed ** the region of fiicts, to that of laws*," or 
in other words, from the re^on of unconnected 
observation and mystified speculation, into that of 
clear arrangement and luminous generalization, that 
we, in proportion, approach towards the worthy con- 
ception of the great Source of order, the eternal 
Cause of all the beauty and harmony of the earth 
and the heavens. 

And the greater the advance made by scientifio 
research in the reduction of the phenomena of the 
world under definite laws, so much the more firmly 
will the foundations of real religion be consolidated ; 
or (to adopt the forcible words of a writerf of the 
present day,) ** Though the atoms of the universe 
may be weighed and measured, and every seeming 
accident shall be reduced to order and to rule, the 
reasons for adoring the Creator, and trusting in him, 
and obeying him, and for loving our neighbour as 
ourselves, will only be proportionally multiplied." 

The combined powers of physical science, so hr 
from b^ing leagued in the vain attempt to expel the 
Sovereign of nature from his rightful dominion, on 
the contrary, are, in truth, firmly allied in the glorious

piii|K>se of upholding the acknowledgment of his 
supremacy, and surrounding the throne of Omnipo- 
tence with the unceasing homage of the trophies

Natural science may be disparaged by some as the 
proud creation of human intellect^ as beginning in 
presumption, and ending in irrelij^on, or at best, 
withdrawing us from what is spiritual to what is 
material. If, however^ physical philosophy be 
human reason employed in investigating the mate- 
rial world, though the process may be of human 
origin, the subject-matter is not. Reason is but 
the instrument, and induction the art; but the 
materials are the universal creation. And if science 
be human, yet nature is divine ; and the science of 
nature is but the rational evidence of God. But 
even intellect and science are his gifts, and the 
human mind his workmanship ; when, therefore, we 
are able, by the exercise of these powers, to inves- 
tigate his works, we are, ourselves, furnishing most 
recondite proofs of the fitness of his works one to 
another, and of the adaptation of the intellectual 
to the material order of things ; and are but filling 
up an essential part in the universal harmony of his 
creation. Wlien we devote our minds to the study 
of his works, we are but employing what He has 
bestowed, in his own service ; we are but rendering 
back his own, it may be hoped ** with increase.**

Introduction. 

We have thug fiur been examining the principles by 
which our study of external nature can alone be

Divinity, in Avhom all those perfections centre^ and 
from whom the entire order of nature emanates. 
We have seen that a primary persuasion of unifor- 
mity m nature is the guide to all our inductive 
investigations, and is universally confirmed by the 
appeal to experimental evidence, from which we 
ascend to laws and principles of successively higher 
generality and comprehensiveness. From such suc- 
cessive generalizations we arrive at the idea of 
secondary (or properly) physical causes; and from 
the contemplation of their uninterrupted order arises 
our conviction of universal design and intelligence 
in the adjustment of the natural creation : whence 
again our belief in the existence and perfections of 
the Creator or First Cause : the great source of that 
moral causation in which all physical causation 
originates. We have noticed the importance of 
keeping the order of this train of reasoning steadily 
in view ; that is, if we would have our belief regu- 
lated by any rational principles. We have seen that 
it is absolutely essential to commence with purely 
phpical investigation by the sole method of induc- 
tion ; and that any departure from this method, any 
reference to other grounds of belief any attachment 
to preconceived notions, any appeal to the dictation 
of authority, are totally inadmissible^ if we would 
preserve unbroken the course of rational evidence 
and deduction in this most important argument

rage physical scieucei not only on general grounds^ 
but particularly under the extraordinary miconcep-* 
tion of thereby advancing the cause of religion,— -» 
\rhile, in truth, they are thus vitiating all rational 
evidence of religion. 

Those who decry reason are not likely to be very 
logical in their own arguments. They do not per* 
ceive that, in discarding the proofs of reason, thej 
are cutting away the pillars of the temple of faith. 
In censuring physical philosophy, they are vainlj 
assaulting the bulwarks of natural religion, and are 
attacking their own allies in the dark. When on 
religious grounds they disparage and condemn the 
study of physical truth, they do not see that, in 
proportion as their arguments might be valid, would 
the proofs of their own religious principles be assailed. 
In rejecting the evidence of inductive science thej 
are rejecting that of natural theology. And whOe 
they so vehemently declaim on the weakness and 
insufficiency of the powers of the human mind for 
investigating religious truth, they do not considert 
that it is precisely on this ground that we would 
restrain its speculations to the plain and humble 
method of inductive research into the fiicts and laws 
of the natural world, and the sublime but insufficient 
deductions from them which lie properly within its 
province ; thence to b^ prepared to advance towards 
those higher attainments of religious illumination 
which supply all the deficiencies of mere natural 
reason. 



208 



RELATION OF NATURAL THEOLOGY 



In pursuing the subject of tho connexion between 
the truths of natural theology and those of revelation, 
and of the independence, on the one hand, of physical 
science as the basis of the evidence^ and on the other, 
the mutual relations of these several great branches 
of the inquiry, I will commence with a few remarks 
on those primary doctrines which exercise so import- 
ant an influence on the views taken of the authority 
and tenour of revelation^ and on the extent to which 
natural reason alone can guide us in those inquiries ; 
on the limit at which its own light fails us ; yet the 
degree of illumination which we must possess, in 
order to find our way even to the point where we 
are to gain access to fuller disclosures. 

Our Ideoji of the Divine AUributee. 

SoifB difference of opinion has prevailed as to the 
mode by which we arrive at our conclusions respect- 
ing the Divine Attributes. It has been maintained, 
on one side, that those conclusions are of the most 
limited nature. It has been contended (and with 
much appearance of reason,) that our inferences can 
only go to the extent of our evidence; that the 
ideas of the Divine Attributes which we acquire in 
natural theology can only be legitimately framed 
and recognised in the degree and character in whidi 
the figicts of nature present the manifestations of 
them ; that we can infer the Divine eternity and 
immensity only from those ideas of duration and 
extendon which the conclusions of geology and 



AND PHYSICAL SaENCE TO BRVELATION. 209 



astronomy suggest; that %ro obtain oar notion of 
the Divine Omnipotence only from those nniform 
laws and unchanging processes in which it is deve- 
loped; that we arrive at our conception of the 
Divine beneficence only from the contemplation of 
good, mixed with evU; that» as far as natoral 
theology is concerned, no adequate ideas of those 
attributes can be acquired, or are even adapted to 
our a])prehensions, but those which the contem- 
plation of physical analogies suggests. In all these 
particulars the conclusions of natural theology ^mpl j 
are extremely imperfect and insnflScient. But we 
have no other ground on wliich to frame our appre- 
hension of a Deity in the first instance. The 
deficiency can be supplied only by the subsequent 
reception of the doctrines of revelation. 

To this reasoning it has been objected, that it 
would leave us with inferences of such attributes as 
not only fall short of any worthy notion of the Deity, 
but are even at variance with all idea of moral 

perfection ; as, for instance, in the case of Icn^icenoe. 
Mere reasoning on natural phenomena would only 
pyQ us an idea of the production of good, mixed 
with a considerable share of eviL It has, there* 
fore, been contended, that we do not, in fact, form 
our conclusions without assuming the perfect and 
universal beneficence of the Deity as antecedently 
probable; and thus, guided by this idea, conclude 
from the manifestations of nature^ which partial^ 
confirm it, the universality and infinity of the Divine

benevolence ; regarding the partial instances of evil 
as, in fact, only apparent and not real exceptions,— 
as merely seeming to be such from the imperfection 
of our apprehensions. And this assumption has 
been traced to the inherent moral sense of human 
nature, ^hich naturally perceives the perfection of 
moral good, and thus cannot but suppose it in an 
infinite degree in the Deity*. 

I %vill merely remark, — 1st When wc abstract 
from this moral sense, it seems on all hands admitted, 
that bare reasonhy on the facts of the natural world 
can conduct us no farther than to the inference of 
good mixed with evil, or to the idea of a mixed 
attribute of beneficence not absolutely infinite. 

2dly. Bare reasoning (without the moral conside- 
ration,) might nevertheless lead us to allow that the 
evil was only apparent in consequence of our limited 
apprehensions. Thus, without referring to the moral 
sense, mere natural theology might leave xis with an 
idea, ea^tremdy defective, no doubt, but still not con* 
tradictary to any more worthy views of the Divine 
nature afterwards to bo inculcated; but, on the 
contrary, from the manifest deficiency, we should be 
rather anxiously predisposed to receive such better 
intimation. 

8dly. The question as to the operation and origin 
of this moral sense, is one which is itself properly

Open to investigation as a branch of metaphyrics of 
great imiH>rtance to natural theology and moml 
philosophy: — ^the question whether such a sense is 
really inheirnt in human nature or acquired f Oi^ 
if universal and natural, whether it may not be 
analjTzed into simpler elements f Or, again, admit- 
ting that man is prone to entertain such ideas^ 
whether this be grounded in reason ? — are all points 
claiming most serious ex»miiuition. 

My object in these remarks is merely to direct 
attention to such important topics of inquiry, without 
pretending to enter into the full discussion of them, 
much less to propose a solution of the difficulties 
The preceding ob8cr\'ation refers particularly to the 
single instance of the attribute of beneficence ; but 
similar remarks must apply to the natural evidence 
of the other Divine perfections. 

The attribute of omnipotence, for example^ is 
evinced by our reasoning upon the inconceivably vast 
indications of power displayed in the visible creatioD. 
We discover everywhere the marks of sudi powef 
exerted to a degree beyond all possibility, of oon* 
ception in its intensity and magnitude. Yet we 
observe it only exercised in particular ways. We 
infer directly its infinity in degree^ but we cannot 
strictly conclude its extension to all kinds of opera*' 
tion. We recognise its effects in constituting and 
originating, in a<^usting and upholding, the order <rf 
physical causes ; we perceive its operation in rega« 
lating the existing state of the universe^ and in the 

p t

RELATION OF NATURAL TIIEOLOGT 



gradual evolution of the existing frame of the world 
out of previous orders of existence ; we trace its 
mighty manifestations, stamped with the same 
unchanging attributes of immensity, through count* 
less ages of duration, and through the boundless 
expanse of space ; but it cannot be said that mere 
reason can therefore infer any other kifid of exercise 
of this power. 

Let it be distinctly borne in mind that the object 
of these remarks is solely that of caution as to the 
proper limits of the mere reasoning upon physical 
order, which is the strict province of the science of 
natural theology. 

There is, however, another point of view in which 
this subject is often regarded, to which I must allude, 
though, as not strictly belonging to our present sub- 
ject, it can be but cursorily noticed, however impor- 
tant in itself. The Deity is proposed as the object 
not merely of our belief, but of our practical adora- 
tion and love, in the imitation, limited and imperfect 
as it must be, of His moral perfections. Hence the 
vital practical importance of the most unimpeachable 
conception of those attributes, and of removing every 
thing like a limitation on their infinite moral excel- 
lence. With the object of maintaining this practical 
view, many excellent writers have gone into a variety 
of speculations, directly imposing limits on our ideas 
of some of the Divine perfections^ lest they should 
be at variance with the infinite excellence of others. 
Thus it has been distinctly argued, in order to vindi- 



AKD PHYSICAL SCIENCE TO REVELAllOK. 21 3 



cate the Divine benevolence, that we must sappose 
the Deity tmalle to prevent evil ; or, in other woidfl^ 
deny his omnipotence*. 

Of such reasonings I will here say no more than 
this: they are maintained and highly approved as 
propounded by the very able writer just referred to» 
by parties of the most unquestionable piety and 
religious zeal. Those, therefore^ who allow and 
admire these views, can have no right to object to 
other si>ecuIations, which, in like manner, tend to 
limit our conclusions as to the same attributes. 
** The truth is, the only rational conclusion which we 
can arrive at in the matter, is, that in the nature of 
things, no such attribute** (i. e. as omnipotence) ^can 
existf.** These are the words of ^Ir. Woodward. 
I very much question whether expressions infinitely 
less bold from other quarters, would not be set down 
as absolute atheism, by the same religious party who 
admire Mr. Woodward. Such, however, is too often 
the inconsistency with >vhich cavils are uiged agunst 
the freedom of inquiry, which we must of necessity 
claim, in any profitable discussion of the truths of 
natural theology. 

In like manner, writers of the Calvinistic school 
have anxiously insisted on the want of any proofs of 
the infinite benevolence of the Deity ; thus fortifying 
their system against the most obvious and forcible

olgoction drawn from the inconsistency with that 
attribute^ in supposing a condemnation to eternal 
misery without moral criminality in the irresponsible 
victim of reprobation, or the jiossibility of effecting

Yet such persons would be the first to exclaim 
against putting any limitation on our notions of 
the Divine power or wisdom, as impious and athe- 
irtieaL 

Limits of Natural Theology. 

The general question as to the extent to which the 
conclusions of natural theology strictly and legiti- 
mately reach, has been the subject of much difference 
of opinion. One class of reasoners have been prone 
to invest their inferences with a systematic com- 
pleteness, which is but illusory : while the perception 
of this has afforded some colour to the opinion of 
others, who have as strenuously denied that mere 
reasoning on these subjects can teach any substantial 
or satisfactory truths. j / 

And those >vho do not go these lengths have 
contended, that what we certainly learn from the 
admitted facts of order and acyustment in the 
material world, is in truth very little. That we caa 
advance only to the inference of the mere existence 
of some powerful intelligent cause ; that we can rise 
only to a vague apprehension of some superior power 
displayed in the adaptation of created things : but

that ire am ascend no further as to any practical 
results : that nre Icam nothing more than (as they 
term it) a "qaiescent intelligence:' that we can 
deduce nothing as to active superintendence of the 
w-orld and the afiairs of men : that (in a word) hatiiral 
theology teaches us nothing of a taond gtvoemor of 
accountable moral agents : nothing of oar own natoro 
or destinies : nothing of incorporeal exlstmoe^ or » 
future state. For all information on these subject^ 
th^ contend we must refer excIuriTolj to reTe> 
lation. 

These arc undoubtcdlj questions ' not onlj moat 
fairly and legitimately open to diseusdon, bnt of 
great moment and importance in a satisfactory

great diversity of opinion has prevailed with rce|)ect 
to them : and, it must be allowed, may very reasoo-

I vnW merely offer one remark as to the entire 
spirit and character of such inquiry. I oonoeive it 
is an equally mistaken view, to prosecute it as sup- 
posing it to involve the credit either of nfttoral 
theology on the one hand, or revelation on tbia 
other. It neither at all affects the truth or valoe of 
natural theology, to admit that it may be deficient 
in some points, or. that they may not properly belong 
to its province : nor is it any disparagemeot to the 
just estimate of our reasoning pdwcn^ to confebs t&at

On the other side, it does not appear to me at all 
essential to support the credit^ or enhance the per- 
fections of Divine revelation, to make out that it is 
the atJy source of information on topics of this 
nature : or to allow that reason may supply some 
first rudiments of religious knowledge, on which it 
is the province of revelation to shed a full and 
abundant illumination*

Opposite Views considered. 

Whatever difference of opinion may prevail as to 
the extent to which the inferences of natural 
theology may reach, or the limits by which they 
must be circumscribed, all rational inquirers on these 
topics, I should conceive, would agree in admitting 
at least some first elements of belief in a Deity, 
however imperfect and insuflicient, as established by 
natural reason. And it appears equally clear, that, 
not only any notion whatever of a revelation, but 
even any statement or proposition of further reli- 
pous truths beyond the primary doctrines of the 
existence and perfections of the Deity, must, firom

I( again, we look to the establishment of the

butes have upon them. This is not the place to 
enter npon the discussion of those evidences. But 
in general it will be apparent^ on a mementos cond« 
deration, that the most material part of the argu- 
ment for revealed religion, (if it is to be supported 
on the ground of miraculous testimony,) essenUally 
turns upon our pmioui admissions with regard to 
the Divine attributes. From these alone do we 
obtain those preliminary ideas^ which confer sufficient 
probability on the notion of a disclosure of the 
Divine will by supernatural interposition, to render 
the question fiurly susceptible of an appeal to evi« 
deuce and testimony : a portion of the reasoning at 
once most essentially important, yet very commonly 
overlooked : and thus left open and defencelesi^ to the 
attacks of scepticism. Thus it becomes peculiarly 
important to scrutinize the extent to which natural 
theology can legitimately supply those considerations 
of antecedent probability, which are absolutely 
necessary before we can entertain the question of 

These considerations seem to me so plain, from 
the mere nature and reason of the thing, that it 
would be hardly necessary to dwell upon them, were 
it not that there are those (as we have already, in 
some manner, noticed,) who^ in the strongest profes- 
sions of a desire to support religion, have systemati- 
cally disparaged the claims of natural theology, and 
decried the use of human reason in the investigation 
of Divine tmUu

DELATION OF NATURAL THBOLOOT 



It is. singular to notice the inconsistency of the 
objections entertained agsunst natural theology by 
diiTcrent parties. Some complain of it as going too 
far; others^ as not going far enough. One party 
object to it as presumptuously usurping the place of 
revelation, encouraging the self-sufficiency of Intel* 
lect, and setting its followers above the instruction 
of the Word of God : as tending to lower the value 
of the mysterious truths of revelation, aud to favour 
the rationalizing system of interpretation. Another 
party affect to despise natural theology and its phy-^ 
meal proofs, as grovelling among mere objects of 
sense, and as restricting our contemplations to 
material things : as defective in its doctrines, leading 
us to no moral governor of the world, inculcating no- 
moral responsibility, nor future state, and thus prac-> 
tically differing little from no relij^on. 

It IS decried, at one time, as vain and weak ; at 
another, as arrogant and dangerous: held in con* 
tempt by those who are ignorant of its nature, and 
dreaded by those who tremble at the dawn of truth 
and free inquiry, for their own dogmas, whether of 
atheism, fanaticism, or orthodoxy. Thus are parties 
so discordant, unconsciously leagued in a common 
cause ; and we hear the language of objection and 
disparagement so precisely the same in the mouths 
of the orthodox and the infidel, of the enthusiast 
and of the atheist^ that it is often impossible to 
distinguisli to which class the objector belongs. 

Among the several opinions entertained in oppo*

ntion to the claims of natural theology to be the 
indispetuaUe baus of reTclatiou, the only one which 
I hare Been Bupportcd even b/ thia show of argu- 
mentt or recognising in any degree the iwcesaitj of 
rational evidence, is, in substance, as follows*': 

Suppose & set of' men who had arriTcd at no belief 
in the truths of natural theology: suppose a person 
cltuming to be a teacher of revelation to appeal 
among them working miracles: would not, it is 
asked, those miracles prove rationally to such perscma 
that the individual was commisdoued from aome 
tuperior pouxr or being, and thus when his system 
was unfolded, and when it exhibited to them the 
doctrines commonly included in whiU is called 
natural theology, they would then, on' rational 
evidence, believe those truths along with the others 
revealed. 

It must be recollected that the question is wholly 
one of etidence. The case supposed is imagined only 
to represent more forcibly, not what is or would be^ 
but what ought to be, the correct coarse of reasoning. 
It may be entirely admitted that the parties in 
question might embixtee the truths propounded to 
them : this they might do on the mero strength of 
the teacher's character, authority, and influence over 
their minds, without any miracles, or even evidenee^ *

under the circumstances supposed, would afford 
strict loj^cal evidence of the teacher's commission 
from so^ne superior being. 

Now, in order to this, it appears to me manifestly 
essential, that not only the existence of some such 
being should be, in the first instance, recognised, 
but a)so the power of any beings, however superior, 
to suspend the laws of nature, (which, to any one 
versed in physical inquiries, would be the most diffi* 
cult point of all,) and further, that this would be 
done for the purpose of conveying a revelation; 
which again must presuppose the power and will of 
such a being to make disclosures of religious truth; 
all this must bo believed on good evidence before 
the teacher's claim could be rationally received ; in 
other words, it would imply a natural theology even 
of a veiy precise kind. 

The case supposed is, indeed, almost an impos- 
sibility; since we can hardly conceive a people 
advanced enough to reason as the hypothesis re- 
quires, who had not attained to some idea of a 
sui)erior power or powers ; to whose influence (em« 
bodied*, perhaps, in the person of the teacher,) they 
would directly ascribe the miracle. But even in 
this case, it is very likely that the result would be 
fiir from that of convincing them by evidence of the 
truths propounded. The supposed working of the

miracle would not^ of itself, be any proof of the 
ejpiitence of a superior beiug ; it would most natu* 
rally and rationally be set down as merely an extra- 
ordinary event, which, though not in the present 
power of the witnesses to exphun, would most pro- 
bably be accounted for by some future discoveries 
in nature; or would be, perhaps, more properly 
ascribed to some hidden knowledge and superior 
skill possessed by the teacher, who really or appa^ 
rently wrought it. 

But those who have maintained this view of the 
matter have gone on to contend, that, in fiu^t, there 
are other sources than those of the reasonings called 
natural theology, from which a notion of the Deity 
and his attributes may be acquired, lliey have 
traced such a notion and belief up to what they con- 
sider a natural constitution and tendency of the 
human mind, an ultimate conviction of our souls ; a 
principle of belief, in fact, innate ; and manifested 
in the universal consent of mankind. 

On all such views I have merely to observe that^ 
entirely allowing the/act of such general persuaston, 
and that it most commonly is nothing more than 
the undefined yet powerful kind of impression 
spoken of, yet to assume that it is therefore an 
ifUMte or ultimate principle of our nature, is to beg 
the very question at issue ; the entire object of dis- 
cussion in natural theology being to ascertain 
whether this conclusion cannot be loj^cally analyied,

It seems, in fiau^t, that to a confuaion of views 
between the admission of the existence of certain 
impressions and feelings in our minds, and the pro^ 
cess of investigating them on the grounds of exact 
aigument and evidence, may be traced many of the 
singular speculations occasionally obtruded on the 
world as profound metaphysico-theological reasoning. 
Many writers on these subjects seem not to keep 
steadily in view which . course they dedre to follow, 
whether to appeal to feelings or to anafyze them.

evidence^ whether of natural or revealed truUu

itself throws no light irhatever on the real question 
at issue, which concerns not what men an led to 
believcy but the rational evidenee an toiicl they 
believe it. Not what are the natural iminessioiis^ 
but kow and why they should be impressed. And 
this more especially with reference to the analysis 
of oacr own conyictions, and the searching inquiry 
which we ouglit to make into the grounds of our 
own belief, with all the light and information we 
possess, in order that, on the most vitally important 
of all subjects, these convictions should be guarded 
by none but the most secure aiguments^ and 
repose on none but the most unassailable foun« 
dations. 

But the majority of those who decry this kind of 
inquiiy, do so upon a more specific ground of faith* 
lliey, in hct, discard all idea of reasoning upon the 
subject. They look to a peculiar kind of impression 
upon the soul, neither to be reasoned upon nor 
resisted. In this their whole apprehension of the 
Deity is made to consist. Thus all philosophical 
proof is useless, and even dangerous ; all exercise of 
the intellect on such a subject is at variance with 
the demands of a true fitith. With those who 
entertain such persuasions, it is of course vain to 
dispute. Discarding reason, they are insenttble to 
fidlades in argument. But should any be diqposed 
to pause before wholly delivering themselves up to 
such views, they might consent to be reminded, 
even upon an authority which they must peculiariy

admit, that ^ ho who cometh to God must believe 
that He iSf and that He is a rewarder of those who 
diligently seek him*.** 

Some, again, in an elevated spirit of religious 
devotion, have contended that none but the true 
Christian can derive any profitable evidences of the 
Divinity from the contemplation of his works; 
that he alone whose soul is enlightened, purified, 
and elevated to God by grace, is able to perceive or 
to enjoy the manifestations of his existence and pre- 
sence in nature. Thus they do not altogether con« 
denm the study of nature ; but they mdntain, that 
when the believer turns his thoughts to the proofs 
of the Divine perfections in his visible works, it is 
solely in obedience to the exhortations of Scripture ; 
and valuable only as an exercise of the spirit of 
humble adoration inculcated in the Bible ; and to be 
carried on with an entire submission to the language 
of Scripture relative to physical subjectsf. But 
though it is undoubtedly true, that the spirit of 
Christianity does thus elevate contemplations which 
would other%vise be restricted to the level of mere 
conclusions of the understanding, and render practa« 
cally fruitful what would otherArise be the barren 
speculations of reason ; though a pure fiuth alone 
can add piety to philosophy, and irradiate with joy 
and hope the contemplation of God in nature ; yet 
it ifl^ at the same tim^ equally true and necessary

that those conclusions in the first instance be sepa- 
rately attained; that those speculations, however 
barren in themselves, be first established on their 
own ground ; that there must first be a philosophy 
to aiford the external evidences of faith; and an 
independent investigation of nature to furnish the 
means of tracing those indications of the Deity*. 

Opinions of this kind often take their rise in a 
zeal for certain particular views of religion, con- 
sidered to be inculcated by revelation; but this 
with some diversity of principle. 

One party, to exalt the work of grace and the 
teaching of iuspimtiou, would reject all conclusions 
of reason ; and in accordance with the peculiar 
scheme of spiritual illumination which they deduce 
from the Bible, would annihilate the carnal evidence 
of depraved sense to vindicate the miyesty of Divine 
truth. 

Another school, to uphold certain theories for 
which they claim the exclusive title of rational 
interpretations of Scripture, on quite opposite 
grounds, would keep natural theology out of sights 
in oi*dcr to make revelation little else than a decia* 
ration of the same truths. 

Both parties seek to uphold the credit of Scrip- 
ture according to the peculiar views they take of it* 
The one by rejecting natural reason to exalt faith ; 
the other by making reason everything, but explain* 
ing away revelation into an identity with itf.

226 RELATION OF NATURAL THEOLOGY 

. To these may be added another school, to whose 
views we may here briefly advert 

That system of theology which reduces all belief 
into an act of obedience to the authority of the 
Church, when thoroughly and consistently followed 
out to its logical consequences, stands within itself 
complete and unassailable. Its advocates, therefore^ 
can fearlessly afford to ^ve full scope to physical 
investigation. Raised far above all ajipeal to reason, 
and not condescending to rest its claims on argu« 
ment, its infallibility cannot be in the slightest 
degree impaired by any i)hilosophical inquiries, even 
if they should terminate in conclusions the most 
hostile to the so-called evidences of revelation. 

A system founded on such principles cannot be 
susceptible of any hostility towards scientific pur- 
suits. And as they confessedly do, to a great 
extent, afford support to natural theology, they may 
even be made useful auxiliaries; they may afford 
occupation to the restless activity of the human 
mind, and thus withdraw men from inquiries of a 
more dangerous nature into things spiritual ; besides 
being susceptible of indirect application in the 
illustration of religious truths. 

Such would be the state of the case where these 
principles were fairly followed out Such, accord- 
ingly, u very much the feeling and practice in the 
Roman Catholic Church^.

I have spoken of sudi a system if consulmfy 
followed up. Now, pretensions of the same kind 
are maintained by a party among oursdves at the 
present day; — ^who, with all the assumptions just 
described, fall short of their consistent consequenoea. 
They refer to a relij^ous authority which discards 
reason, yet is afraid to clum infallibility; — whidi 
rejects human means of conyiction, yet does not 
pretend to divine powers; — ^which affects to com- 
mand submission, yet dreads the agitation of aiga« 
ment Hence in their eyes all scientific investigation 
is regarded with the utmost suspicion and hostili^; 
all inquiries into i)hy8ical causes are either pro&ne 
intrusions on forbidden ground, or empty deludoni 
of blinded self-conceit, and of the most fearful 
tendency. They must therefore be discardedy or 
rather, all science must be so modified as merely to 
hold a subordinate place in a great mystical system, 
and be interpreted wholly in accorflance with 
certain high principles on which that system it 
founded; if viewed otherwise, it is dangerous and 
profime. 

Such appears to be the nature of their ideas on 
the subject, whenever, through the obscurity which 
envelopes ,the writings of this school, we can catch 
a glimpse of their meaning. Hius, we are told, ^ In

It will be needless to comment on the entire con- 
fusion in which such mysticism involves all rational 
evidence. Yet a system not claiming entire infalli- 
bility, cannot surely dispense with some appeal to 
such evidence, if it really involve a reference to 
Divine inspiration. 

To an ordinary inquirer of plain sense and honest 
purpose, a professed belief in revelation, as such, it 
would seem, must, in any sense, imply a reference to 
its alleged evidences, examined by reason ; and their 
testimony and its application must presuppose the 
existence, attributes, and providence of a revealing 
Deity, already known independently of revelation, 
and therefore discovered and believed by the exer- 
cise and conviction of our unaided intellectual facul- 
ties employed in the study of his works. 

In any way, then, this confounding together the 

respective provinces of reason and of faith leads 

men into equally manifest error and inconsistency ; 

— ^they must fall into a palpable ^ petitio principii,**

Meanwhile the enemies of the truth are not

Independence of Scientific and Revealed Truth. 

To those who would wish to see the edifice of 
religious truth reared upon a solid and unassailable 
foundatiouy it will surely not seem unimportant to 
dwell on the necessity of a due onler in the dispo- 
sition of our proofs; of making the belief in revelation 
depend on the secure support of natural theology; 
and this again oh the truths elicited by inductive 
science ; and with this view carefully to distinguish 
the nature of scientific proof from that of religions 
belief. And this is the more necessaiy, since there 
are not wanting those who so fitr confound all sneh 
distinctions, as not only to supersede natural theologj 
by revelation, but even go a step further, and lode 
to the Bible as a source of instruction for the truths 
of natural science ; that is, for those very truths on 
which natural theology rests, and on which eons5» 
quently its own evidences ultimately depend. Tbera 
are some, indeed, who have professed to found entira

systems of philosophy Avholly on the basis of ini 
authority ; others Avho do not go this length, at least 
from the peculiar view they adopt of the character of 
the inspired WTitings, would mix up their authority 
with that of experimental proof, and imag^e either 
that the one or the other can receive an accesaon of 
evidence; that that which is divine can be made 
more sure by human confirmation, or that which has 
the evidence of sense more certain by the appeal to 
authority*. 

Let us then look at the general distinction between 
the ground of science and of faith. What is scientific 
inquiry ? And what are the objects we have in view 
in pursuing its investigations ? Is not such inquiry 
necessarily limited to questions of fact, and such 
discoveiy of laws and causes as we can legitimately 
deduce by strict reasoning upon those focts ? Are 
not such objects exdusivdy those of truth as discover^ 
able by the sole use of our reasoning fisiculties? If 
then we either adopt any other standard whatsoever 
in stich questions^ or pursue our inquiries by a reference 
to any other authority whatsoever than solely that of 
inductive inference from observed phenomena, we 
are deviating from the proper line of sdentifie 
inquiry; we are renouncing the principles of the 
inductive philosophy altogether. 

Yet that which is no guide in matters of science, 
may be the highest standard of truth in reference to 




I 




AND PUTSICAL 8CIENGB TO REVELATION. 231 

matters trhich properly beknig to its province. The 
truths of revelation, received npon their proper 
moral evidence, evince their di\ine excellence when 
directed to the high and peculiar ends for which 
they are designed. But the moment we so entirely 
mistake their object as to i^ply them to the purposes 
of philosophic instruction, our inquiries lose every 
characteristic of rational or consistent investigation. 
Scientific and revealed truth are of essentially 
different naUire$^ and if we attempt to combine and 
unite them, we are attempting to unite things of a 
kind which cannot be consolidated, and shall infidlibly 
injure both. In a word, in physical science we must 
keep strictly to physical induction and demonstra^ 
tion ; in religious inquiry, to moral proof; but never 
confound the two together. When we follow 
observation and inductive reasoning, our inquiries 
lead us to mence. When we obey the authority of 
the Divine Word, we are not led to science but to 
faith. The mistake consists in confounding these 
two distinct objects together; and imagining that 
we are pursuing science when wo introduce the 
authority of revelation. They cannot be combined 
without losing the distinctive character of both. : If 
£uth is to be our guide to natural truth at aH it 
must be whoBy so. If we appeal to its authority at 
all on points of natural science, we must adopt it as 
our sole authority ; we must renounce all guidance 
of reason, all appeal to the evidence of sense. If we 
are to reject the results of observation and the

evidence of our reason on one point, we in fact give 
up the principle of making them our guides to truth: 
that is, vro give up the principle and ground of all 
experimental knowledge ; of all independent search 
into the works of the Creator ; and by consequence^ 
of all rational proof of his existence, and thus ulti« 
mately of his revelations too. 

To the connexion of physical causes and the order 
of the material creation we appeal for the evidences 
of the Divine existence and perfections. Until we 
have proof of a Deity, we can have none of a reve- 
lation. Upon the proofs of natural religion those 
of revelation essentially depend. To give the latter, 
then, any share whatever in determining the former, 
is to make the premises depend on the conclusion. 
The evidences of natural religion are derived from 
physical knowledge. To assume, then, the authority 
of Scripture as in the slightest degree applicable to 
prove the order of physical causes and the laws of 
the material creation, is to make revelation the basis 
of natural theology,— ^r, in other words, to b^ the 
question, to vitiate the whole argument, and to 
destroy all rational evidence. Yet it would really 
seem that there are some who do not see the 
contradiction of such a course ; — of believing in reve- 
lation without first believing in God ; of receiving a 
doctrine as declared from Him before we prove that 
He is. For such is precisely the proceeding of those 
who look to the Bible^ as such, for instruction in the 
science of nature. They do not seem to percdve 



^kStm^Sm 



AND PHYSICAL BaENCE TO REVELATION. 233 

that the arguments of nataral theology mnst^ from 
the nature of the case, be indepmimU of the truth of 
revelation ; and that, consequently, the evidences of 
physical trtUh^ on which the former wholly depend, 
must be, in like manner, sought for intUpendentfy of 
the authority of Sa^ipture. To allow the opporite 
course is to entangle the chain of reasoning in 
hopeless confusion, and to make the whole evidence 
of religion an argument in a cirde. 

This essential independence of Scripture and 
physical science is the more necessary to be attended 
to^ because though it has not been overlooked by 
some writers, yet it has not been generally main- 
tained upon its riyht basis. And it appears, in 
reference to some floating opinions of tbe present 
time, peculiarly needful to insist upon this distinction, 
so essential to the stability of the evidences of 
natural theology, and, by consequence^ to those of 
revelation also, yet so strangely misconceived, and 
practically denied, by some parties at the present 
day. _ 

The observations which I have thus &r made have 
referred to any, the most general, notion which can 
be entertained of a revelation of Divine truth, in 
whatever we may imagine it to consist, or by what- 
ever means conveyed. They will, however, apply 
with equal force when we proceed to consider the 
nature and mode of such communications of Divine 
truth in a more precise sense ; when we advance to 
the examination of that particular view of revelation

Avhich consists iii the adoption of the volume of the 
Bible, as its sole authentic record and depository. 

And this view of the subject naturally and imme- 
diately brings us to the examination of a iK>int of 
considerable importance bearing upon the connexion 
of natural and revealed truth, and which arises out 
of the more particular notion of revelation to which 
we are now referring ; — ^the question of certain real 
or alleged contradictions between the results of 
physical investigation and the language of the Bible, 
and the attempts which have been made to reconcile 
them* 

Among those who admit the general truth of the 
foregoing remarks,— who allow, when it is distinctly 
put to them, that the laws of nature, in order to 
become evidences of a Deity, must be established on 
independent grounds, there are yet those who feel 
difficulties with regard to certain Scriptural expres- 
fdons. Many who fully acknowledge, when it is 
pressed upon them, the fallacy of making the truth 
of Scripture the basis of its own evidence, yet still 
feel considerably perplexed by alleged discrepanciei 
between science and revdation. They still seem to 
think the cause of religion in danger, unless the 
language of all parts of the Bible can be brought 
into exact accordance with the facts and laws dis- 
covered in the natural world, and would thus hazard 
its entire credit ujion the chance of contradiction 
which may arise at every fresh disclosure of physical 
disooveij. 







AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE TO REVELATION. 236 

In any iK>int of view, this is certainly to evince a 
most disjianiging estimate of the evidences of reve* 
lation, if not to cast a direct reflection on them, and 
betrays a singular misconception of its spirit and 
object. Those Avho most fully and rationally appre- 
ciate the evidences and nature of Christianity, will 
be the fii*st to i)erccive and to allow that its stability 
can be in no way injured by the pursuit of physical 
truth, or the existence of those contradictions so 
much referred to^ between the letter of the Scriptural 
representations of the order of creation and the 
visible existing monuments of the changes which the 
earth*s surface lias undergone, before the date of the 
human race*. 

We might, indeed, infer this even upon the 
getieral truth of the foregoing remarks. For we 
have thus seen that to suppose revelation a guide to 
physical truth would involve us in a petitio principii^ 
It camiot possess any authority on such points 
without vitiating the whole train of evidence of 
religion, both natural and also revealed. 

Hence, then, it follows by direct inference^ that if 
any representation in Scripture be at variance with 
the truths elicited in the natural world, such discre- 
pancy cannot be really injurious to the maintenance 
of the proper spiritual authority of revelation ; nor 
can it in the least vitiate its claims as a disclosure of 
moral and religious truth.

Indeed, the existence of such contradictions maj 
serve to warn the inquirer against arguing in a circle^ 
as reminding him that revelation oiigJU not to be 
appealed to for physical truth, since he thus perceives 
that in these instances it cannot. 

Attempts to combine Philosophy and Scripture. 

The slightest consideration of the subject in accord- 
ance with the principles already laid down, might 
suffice to any unprejudiced and reasonable inquirer. 

Still, however, there are some Avho cannot feel 
satisfied; and under a confused impression which 
they entertain of the relation between physical and 
revealed truth, are impatient of even any apparent 
contradiction between them, and anxiously catch at 
any means of reconciling them. It will, therefore, 
be desirable to make a few further remarks on these 
discreimncies, and attempted reconciliations. 

The history of past ages supplies us with familiar 
examples of the spirit in which such questions were 
viewed. We well know how the letter of religious 
authority was appealed to in opposition to the dis- 
coveries of astronomy. But though these are not 
the very same points which occupy attention at the 
present day, yet the principle involved is identically 
the same. Whether we are to adhere to the letter 
of Scriptural representation in opposition to the tes- 
timony of inductive research, or whether it is safe^ 
rational, or consistent with an enlightened and well- 




AND PHTSIGAL KtENCB TO BEVELATION. 237 

grounded fiiitli, to stake the reception or rejection 
of Christianity on the credit of these particular 
expressions, is still the question. 

Without dwelling on the instances of the wild 
speculators of past ages» who deduced phjncal sys- 
tems on the authority of what they considered the 
doctrines of revelation, and firamcd schemes of phi* 
losophy on principles which essentially destroyed its 
claims to being philosophy, we may find that, in 
fact, even at the present day, there are not wanting 
disciples of such a school, nor even among the pro- 
fessed followers of science, those who seriously con- 
struct and maintain such systems, which are^ in foct» 
neither systems of fiuth nor philosophy, but a com- 
bined perversion of both* 

But it will neither be necessary nor pleasing to 
dwell on such speculations. Even among those who 
are most ready to allow their unreasonableness^ we 
may discover many who entertain views which are 
the very same in the principle on which they are 
framed. 

To adopt the very notion of expecting or wishing 
to find in Scripture any confirmation of the results 
of inductive science, — to attach importance to 
accordances between the descriptive or poetical 
language of the Bible^ and the conclusions of phi- 
losophy on the one hand, or to consider the want 61 

such accordances as any objection on the other^ to 

seek to prop up the credit (^ the sacred writers on 
the verbal coincidences with phyncal results^ or

think it endangered bj the violation of such coin- 
cidence ; all this is, in fact, the veiy same thing in 
principle as to make revelation the guide to phi- 
losophy. It is to imagine the letter of its language 
the proper evidence of physical truth. The very 
same mistaken principle of reasoning then is charge- 
able on those who construct systems of philosophy 
out of the Bible, and those "who attempt to force its 
language into accordance with philosophical results. 
The very same misconception of the distinct nature 
and grounds of religious and scientific truth is 
evinced equally in the speculations of the Hutchin- 
sonian school of a past age, and those of the Bible- 
geologists of the present day. 

It may, indeed, be true with regard to the system 
of gravitation, and the motion of the earth, that it is 
not nowthought necessaiyto enter into the discussions 
of Biblical criticism to find support for them, nor, on 
the other hand, imagined that the admission of them 
is dangerous to the authority of faith. Still the very 
same principle has been and still is adopted by a 
great number of writers, with regard to the facts of 
geology and the account of the creation as conveyed 
in certain passages of the Old Testament. Whether 
the particular point in question be the nature of 
gravitation and the production of light, or the 
motion of the earth and stability of the sun, the 
speculations thus raised are still only exemplifica- 
tions of the very same spirit which has dictated 
similar questions connected with the results of geo*

dependent upon the very same rational conndera- 
tions which are now generally allowed to apply, in 
the more obvious cases respecting the system of the

Distinct Objects of BetdaHan. 

Even in the most general point of view, and with* 
out at present entering upon any more precise dis- 
tinctions, whatever may be the peculiar view enter- 
tained as to the nature of a Divine revelation, it 
must assuredly be allowed that its object and aim 
must be essentially distinct from the inculcation of 
physical truth. UiK>n almost any conception which 
may be adopted of those objects, we ask what pos- 
sible reference can the physical expressions used by 
the sacred ^vriters bear to the religious truths which 
it was their object to communicate t 

Common sense surely suggests the rule^ that what 
is but incidental in any case, should be fidrly viewed 
apart from what is the main object For example^ 
the character of a history^ as such, is in no way com- 
promised, though the author may happen to use 
terms of art incorrectly. The conclusiveness of 
scientific research is in no way impaired by inacen- 
racies of stj/le. In many of the most famous master- 
pieces of design, the arUst has fallen into incon- 
gruities and anachronisms; yet the most acute 
critics are foremost to admit that this in no degreisi

spoils tlie force aud beauty of the painting. One 
and the same reason evidently applies in all these 
cases : viz., that these defects occur only in what is 
but incidental to the design, and distinct from the 
main object in view. 

To expect to find the truths of science declared 
by revelation, or to feel a difficulty when the forms 
of expression adopted by the sacred writers are con- 
tradicted by the facts elicited in nature, is as un« 
reasonable as it M'ould be to expect to find the theo- 
rems of Euclid enforced by Act of Parliament ; or if 
in the statutes we should chance to meet with any 
expression not mathematically correct, either to con- 
demn Euclid as illegal, or to think it necessary for 
vindicating the majesty of the laws, to resort to all 
the arts of si)ecial pleading for explaining away the 
discrepancy. Scriptural geology is as preposterous 
in principle as statutable geometry. By the same 
rule we ought to criticise poetry on the grounds of 
metaphysics; and establish the processes of che- 
mistry by the precepts of rhetoric 

Yet to allow that these are absurdities, is no dis- 
paragement either to law or mathematics, to poetry 
or to metaphysics, to chemistry or rhetoric, con- 
sidered in themselves. It is only in the attempt to 
combine them that the absurdity arises. Each in 
their proi)er way, and directed to their proper pur- 
poses, are excellent ; it is only when we apply the 
one for the puriK>ses of the other that we act 
absurdly, both are perverted, abusedt and ii\jared.

lilj object in these remarks has been rather to 
point out and discuss the great prineipk of the ques- 
tion than its details ; to pkce the whole subject on 
what I conceive to be its right ground^ rather than 
to follow up any minor points connected with it. 
And it is chiefly as conducting their aigument upon 
those details^ instead of looking to princiflet^ that 
I find fault with most writers who liave treated on 
tlie subject. Even if we should allow that, in some 
instances, the attempts to reconcile the letter of 
Scripture vAih the facts of geology, have been inge* 
nious and plausible, and supported vnfih consider^ 
able skill and learning, still the objection which I 
entertain against them would remain in full foroe^ 
being directed against the radical defect of ihevtfirH 
principle ; the idea of seeking for such an accordance 
at all, and the utter improbability that it should 
have been contemplated in the delivery of the 
Judaical law, or in the Mosaic history. 



Low Views of Betelaticm. 

Such considerations, it might be hoped, would 
satisfy any dispassionate inquirer. But it is unfor- 
tunately obvious that a variety of causes interfere 
to render many professed followers of Christianity 
insensible to the reasonableness of these views. 
Adopting their creed blindly from education, cus- 
tom, or party, too many hold their religion only by 
a most loose and uncertain tenure, and are lamen-

tably confused in their notions of its nature. Hence 
they dread a formidable shock to Christianity in 
every physical discovery ; and in the obscurity irhich 
surrounds them, imagine danger to the truth in every 
exposure of error. Insensible to the real strength 
of their position, they live in groundless alarm for 
its security; and accustomed to cherish faith in 
ignorance, they apprehend, in every advance of 
knowledge, the approach of the enemy of their 
salvation. 

Too many nominal Christians entertain onlf the 
most miserable idea of the nature of the gospel 
they profess to believe ; their only notion too often 
consists in a confused general impression of a certain 
sacredness in Scripture, which produces little effect 
beyond that of making them afraid to enter its pre- 
cincts, and search its recesses for themselves, and 
yet more fearful lest its sanctity shotdd be invaded 
by others. 

And their dread of openly encountering any con- 
tradictious, and their anxious desire to shelter them- 
selves under even the most frivolous explanations, if 
it does not betray a lurking distrust of the proper 
evidences of their faith, at least evinces the lowest 
and most unworthy conceptions of the spirit and 
meaning of the Bible^ and an almost total absence 
of due distinction between the design and applica- 
tion of the several portions of which it ip made up. 

That such misconception should prevail is indeed 
a lamentable^ but not a surprising instance of the

liability of liuman nature to misapply the best gifts^ 
whether of Providence or grace. And its influence 
has been unhappily cherished and confirmed by the 
prevalence of those theological systems which haTe 
dictated the practice of Kteixdiziug upon all the 
expressions of the sacred \iTiters ; so that the magi- 
nificent imagery of the finest passages of inspiration 
is reduced to the lowest standard of verbal dog- 
matism; and minds incapable of appreciating the 
Divine sublimity of those descriptions, think to add 
to the evidence of their truth by a forced and unnM 
tural perversion of their meaning. 

With others again, the sincere, but (as we musfc 
consider it,) misguided spirit of religious fiuiatioi8m» 
produces similar effects. Blinded to all but the 
internal light of his spiritual impressions^ the enthu- 
siast will always entertain a deeply-rooted and 
devoted hostility against any such distinctions af 
those here advocated. Maintiuning the literal 
application of every sentence, every syllable of the 
Divine word, he rejects, as impious, the slightest 
departure from it. Human reason, along with all 
science which is its offspring, is at best carnal and 
unsanctified ; and should any of its conclusions be 
advanced in contradiction to the letter of a scrip- 
tural text, this completely seals its condemnation af 
absolutely sinful, and equivalent to a n^jection of 
revelation altogether. 

In such cases we may most readily make every 
allowance due to sincerity, however mistaken. But

there are other instances in which, unfortunately, 
little clium to such indulgence can be foutid. There 
are some who join most yebementlj in the crj 
against science in general, and geology in particular, 
as dangerous to religion, tqnm no sincere gnunds of 
rdigiouM conticHon. 

Their adoption of a certain form of faith is dic- 
tated by motives of ejepedien^^ and the mere value 
of its practical effects on society. Not themselves 
recognising its claims as founded in trutii^ they 
uphold the established creed, as weU as all received 
errors popularly engrafted upon it, as a convenient 
and effectual instrument for securing the influence 
of practical restraints on the multitude. Hence 
they condemn all inquiries which may come into 
collision with any portion of the popular belief; and 
against the agitation of any question which may 
shake established prejudices^ or suggest any distinc- 
tions in the application of Scripture, there is an 
immediate and indiscriminate cry raised that they 
unsettle men's minds, and are heretical doctrines of 
a most dangerous tendency, and such as will weaken 
and eflbce all sense of religious and moral obli* 
gation. 

But even among the best men and most sincere 
1i>elievers, there exists too often a sort of dread of 
meeting such questions in a strictly honert frame of 
mind. Those who have the most conscientious 
regard for truth, in everything else seem to think it 
dispensed with in supporting the cause of religion.

different form, in dreading the dissemination of 
knoM'ledgo if even imagined to be at variance with 
established religious tenets. 

The one party seeking to support religion by the 
propagation of falsehood, the other by the sup- 
pression of truth, both agree in treating truth as if it 
were falsehood, and thus give its enemies the fiiirest 
ground to think it so. 

Geological Interpretation of Scripture. 

From what we have already seen of the invaluable 
evidence supplied by geology to the great truths of 
natural theolog}', and thence to the foundations of al| 
religion, we shall be prepared to allow its high 
importance. We must, further, have perodved, in 
going through even the mere outline of that evidence^ 
the positive inferences which it involves^ and on 
which it 18 indeed founded, as to the gradual intro^ 
duction of the present order of things, and the existing 
species of organized beings, out of previous forms of 
existence. And it is manifest that this is, apparently 
at least, in direct opposition to the literal and obvi« 
ous sense of the representations giveq of the procesa 
of creation, at once, out of darkness and confusiont 
at a recent epoch, given in several passages of th^

boldly to front the difficulty, and avow tbe contra- 
diction in plain terms ; but instead of this, we observe 
them exerting their utmost ingenuity to elnde the 
contradictions, either by disguising the ffulU^ or 
glossing over the toordn with the most flimsy inter- 
pretations. 

It would, indee<1, apjiear extraordinary, that the 
notion of looking for modem science in the ancient 
Scriptures should be found satisfactory to any ^lerson 
of ordinary sense, were it not that we discover many 
causes which tend, in this case, to blind the clearest 
])erceptions. The subject, when sim]>ly and calmly 
considered, is plain, and hardly open to misappre- 
hension ; but men cannot be brought to consider it 
simply and calmly. Yet what mode of proceedinj^ 
can be more irrational? passages are quoted from 
^vritings produced ages before any of the fiicts of 
geology were understood; and now that they are 
kno>vn, the critic sets about to make those jiassages 
speak the language of modem science ! 

These writings constitute the delivery of a reli- 
gious system to the Israelites ; and now men try to 
make them supply astronomical and geological 
instruction to Christians ! 

In all this the object is so palpably mistaken, that 
wei-e the suggestions of the critic ever so happy, and 
the expositions themselves ever so luminous and 
natural, we could not attach any serious weight to 
them. But when we come to observe^ in the 
minority of such cases, how entirely gratuitous

the theories, and how miserably stndned the verbal 
interpretations, which are necessary in order to effect 
the accordance, the whole attempt must appear yet 
more manifestly futile. For let us only dwell for a 
moment on the nature of these interpretations. 

When a commentator of the present day sets 
about to put a particular interpretation on a jmssage 
in an ancient author, he may, upon an examination 
of the critical sense of the words, and the construction 
of the sentence, make out a meaning which to Aim 
is plausible, and in itself consistent. But there is 
another question entirely distinct from this, too often 
quite overlooked, but essentially imi)otant to a true 
interpretation: viz., whether it is probable^ from 
concurrent circumstances, that this was the sense, 
in \H>mt of fact, actually ifUended by the author. It is 
one thing to make out such a sense as, to our appre* 
hcnsion, the uhmxIs may bear^ quite another to infer 
that this was the sense really in tlte mind of the 
writer. 

Now, in the geological inteqiretatiou of Scripture, 
this consideration seems strangely overlooked. Al- 
lowing for a moment that the verbal construction, or 
tlie proi)osed sense, is one which the passage may be 
made to bear, where is the probability that it was the 
bitended eignijicatum f 

Supposing it granted that by some critical process 
these descriptions may be brought to take a verbal 
sense, accordant with the facts elicited by geology, 
still the question is^ Can we soberly bring ourselves

If bat a moment's conMdcration be bestowed on 
the circumstances of the case, can it be seiiousl/ 
imagined that the delivery of the Juducal law wta 
really intended to embrace the doctrines of geology, 
and this too under the guise of expressions which, iq 
tlieir obvious sense, are directly contradictory to thoa^ 
doctrines? Is it on any ground conceivable that 
such a purpose could have been in view in the 
delivery of any divine revelation? and much less in 
that vouchsafed to the Israelites. And if it were, 
could any method be devised more adverse to its 
accomplishment ? For we are thus driven to suppose 
a design of revealing certun truths by effectually 
concealing them: since we know tliat, in point of 
&ct, the hidden sense was not disclosed : and &ont 
the time of Moses doAmwards, no one has ever 
imagined the secret meaning of the description till 
the present day, and when disclosed it afibrdi no

Representation of the Creation in Genesis. 

With a total disregard to all such considerations as 
those last adduced, we find a certain school of inter- 
preters of Scripture continually labouring to make 
out some sense of the terms in which the creation is 
described in the first chapter of Genesis, to make it 
square with truths which could not have been in 
contemplation in the delivery of the narrative ; and 
exhausting every resource of critical skill to force 
the language of the representation into accordance 
with facts now attested by the oiganic remains of 
former orders of existence, which could not have 
been intended to be represented. 

Formerly the geological interpreters were engaged 
in taxing to the utmost the powers of philology, 
to convert the six days into periods of millions of 
years; notwithstanding that they are described 
precisely as alternations of day and night ; and that 
this is absolutely implied is the very puri)ose of the 
whole description, since the six days must manifestly 
be taken in the same sense as the seventh. On the 
other hand they had to exert not less ingenuity to 
make the order of geological epochs -accord with 
these periods. This scheme, however,, was at length 
fbund to answer the views of neither party. The 
theological critic could not admit such strained 
and dangerous interpretation, and the advance of 
geological research soon showed every one that there 
were, in fietct, no such marked epochs in the sacoessive

organized beings. 

At the present daj another riew has leeeiTed the 
sanction of some eminent names^ and has obtained 
considerable currency. It has been oonoeiTed that 
the narrative in Genesis is intended to describe 
separateljy in few words, (in the first Terser) the 
original creation of all things ; after this the inde- 
finitely long history during which all the changes 
indicated by geology took place^ is passed over in 
silence ; a new period then commences^ which may 
be imderstood according to the literal order of the 
narrative, provided some latitude be allowed in the 
interpretation of the terms. A states If not of 
darkness and chaos, yet at least temporary disorder 
and obscurity, was produced ; and the work of the 
existing creation, or at least reprodiiction and 
arrangement, then commenced, and was continued 
as described in the following part of the chapter, and 
perfected in six natural days^. 

Now, without entering upon the grounds of such 
an interpretation, I will merely observe (looking 
only to the verbal construction,) how very wide a 
latitude in the meaning of words must be allowed 
before we can affix such a sense as this to a repre- 
sentation so precise and circumstantial; and eveij 
reader of the slightest taste and discernment will 
surely at once exclaim against it as totally at variance

Mith the obvioas teiiour of the whole style of descrip*

such a Terdon can appear satisfaetoiy, who can 
believe that this is what Moses reallj intended to

cation of language of a kind which I cannot appre- 
ciate. It seems to me only necessaiy to turn for a 
moment from the jmraphrase to the plain text^ from 
the critical refinements to the simple language of 
this magnificent composition ; from the philosophical 
theory to the obvious tenour and train of this most 
sublime imagery, to be fully satisfied as to the 
meaning intended to be conveyed : a meaning totally 
distinct from anything philosophical, or bearing the 
most remote reference to any anticipations of geolo- 
gical discoveries. 

Another view of the matter has been proposed by 
an eminent philosopher, which amounts to an admis- 
sion that it is impossible at the present day to fix 
an^ certain meaning on compositions of such anti- 
quity, and so entirely destitute of all elucidation 
from contemiK>rai7 writings, as tlie Mosaic records^. 
Such An idea* of course, has called forth no small 
censure. But surely even this is scarcely more 
destructive to all definite interpretation than versions 
like those we have just mentioned ; — sach an idea» 
honestly avowed, is surely prefisrable to the indirect

introduction of principles which, fairly carried oat» 
may enable us to fix upon auj given passage^ any 
required sense. 

I am assuming that the inquirer and interpreter 
are both sincere seekers of truth. If indeed the 
object be^ instead of discovering truth, to say some* 
tiling plausible to satisfy prejudice, and avoid giving 
oifence to popular belief, there is no limit to the 
inventions which men will not readily swallow down, 
if only made palatable to their prepossessions. 

Admission of Contradictions. 

Let the appeal be made to any reader of ordinary 
sense, not prepossessed in favour of a theoiy, and it 
seems to me impossible that he can understand the 
description, (whether in the shorter form of the 
Decalogue, or the more expanded of Genesis,) con- 
sidered simply as to its terms, otherwise than as 
presenting a magnificent picture of Almighty power, 
and embod}ing the representation of one, original, 
entire, simple, universal act of Divine interposition^ 
at once, and for the first time, fi-aming and calling into 
being and operation, out of previous universal darkness 
and confusion, the heavenly bodies, as well as the 
earth, and all the races of organized beings upon it, in 
the actual progressive stages assigned to the six days 
specially described as literally such. Even if we 
allow the separation of the first verse as a distinct 
account of an earlier creation, (which, to my appre-

hension, seems a very forced dissociation of the 
members of a sentence,) still» in the second yerse, 
the entire tenour of this unrivalled imagery seems 
incapable of conveying any other impression than 
that of the total absence of all organized existence^ 
and the prevalence of universal confusion and total 
darkness, until the work of the first day com- 
menced^. 

Now when we refer to geology, (as indeed has 
already been rendered sufficiently manifest,) the 
sure monuments which we derive from the study of 
organic remains, disclose to us e\idences of a series 
of gradual changes and repeated creative processes, 
going on without any one sudden universal inter- 
vention or creation of the existing world out of the 
ruins of a former. Geology shows that in none of 
its epochs, least of all in the later, has any universal 
elemental change occurred, or any trace been left of 
even a temporary chaos, followed by a simultaneous 
universal restitution of things. 

Comparing then these indisputable conclusions 
with the representations in the Hebrew Scriptures, 
to whatever extent critical skill may stretch the 
meamng, there is an insupei^aUe discrepancy in the 
most material points of the description. We, in 
truth, gain nothing whatever by critical refinements 
so long as the passage be admitted to describe a 
tadden universal interposition of Divine power for

the formation out of previous confusion of a world 
Iteopled with organized life in its existing format at a 
]x>riod corre8iK>nding to the origin of the human 
race according to the received chronology. 

The contradiction is scarcely less palpable in these 
more refined and far-fetched versions than in the 
vulgar sense. 

Surely then, instead of attempting to tamper with 
all rules of common sense in the interpretation, it 
would be far better at once honestly to allow that 
we cannot reconcile the description to the facts, nor 
find the original of the picture in nature. Surely, 
looking as well at the plain and obvious sense in 
which any unprejudiced reader would of necessity 
view the Scriptural representations, as at the forced 
and unsatisfactory nature of the interpretations, as 
also at the manifest unreasonableness of the very 
principle on which any such intei*pretation can be 
rendered desirable, — on every consideration, we shall 
see the better and wiser course of openly acknow- 
ledging the contradiction, and allowing the impos- 
sibility of making out an accordance between the 
literal six days' work of creation, and the visible 
evidences and existing monuments of it, — ^between 
the letter of the representation (either as given in 
the delivery of the Decalogue to the Israelites, or as 
subsequently expounded by Moses in the book of 
Genesis,) and the perceptible and observable order 
of the works of the same Divine Being from whom 
the Judaical dispensation emanated.

256 RELATION OP NATURAL THEOLOGY 

I have been particular in stating plainly and 
unreservedly the exact nature and extent of the 
contradiction between the language of the Word ot 
God delivered to the. Hebrews and that of the 
monuments which we now extract from his works. 
It seems to me peculiarly needful so to set it fortht 
and not to shrink from the open and honest avowal 
of it;— especially while we recollect that the physical 
evidence which thus palpably contradicts the letter 
of the Scriptural representation, is the veiy same 
which establishes the truth of the Divine perfections, 
and proves the fact of creation, however different in 
its mode of accomplishment from what our precon« 
ceived opinions would suggest, and however little we 
may be able to trace the precise means employed in 
carrying it on* 

Adaptations to the Ideas of the Jews. 

Now, so far as regards the first chapter of Genesis, 
we may remark, that even those divines who adopt 
the most approved views of the nature of inspiration 
may and do allow, that an inspired teacher mighty in 
irrelevant points, be left to his own unassisted 
convictions, and on such matters would be no more 
enlightened than his contemporaries. Many eminent 
divines have even admitted that current opinions 
and prejudices, though erroneous, might yet be 
adopted and turned into a vehicle of moral and 
religious instruction to those to whom they were

habitual, without derogation to the inspired 
of the teacher. 

On such a ground we might cei 
to regard the first chapter of Genesis as embodTing 
what were the commonly received ideas among the 
Jews, borrowed perhaps from some poetical cosmo- 
gonj, and which Moses was inspired to adapt and 
apply to the ends of religious instruction ; — to the 
assertion of the miyestj, power, and unity of the 
Creator, and the prohibition of the worship of false 
gods ; especially of those animals and other material 
objects which were peculiarly pointed out as being 
merely the creatures of the true God ; and this 
doubtless in a more particular enumeration, because 
they were especially the objects of that idolatrous 
worship into which the Israelites were so prone to 
relapse. The entire description being thus divested 
of the attributes of a real history, the concluding 
portion of it, the account of the solemnization of 
the seventh day as the Sabbath is of course equally 
divested of an historical character, and thus cannot 
be understood as referring to any primieval institu- 
tion, and can therefore only be regarded as having 
been designed for the more powerful enforcement of 
that institution on the Jews. And this indeed would 
be no more than accords with the opinion of many 
of the most approved commentators^ who on quite 
independent critical and theological grounds^ have 
regarded the passage (Genesis ii. 8,) conveying that

institution as correctly to be understood in a pro^ 
leptical or anticipatory sense. 

Perhaps sucli an accommodation might be made 
to the ignorance of the Jews in the introduction of 
the htw, in order to avoid the unnecessary difficulty 
of a collision with invincible prepossesrions on sub- 
jects irrelevant to the purpose of the law, and which 
in fact would but have tended to make th^n rgect 
it. It may also be contended that in general any no- 
tion of a Divine communication implies adaptatian to 
the ideas, language, habits, dispositions, and opinions 
of the parties addressed ; since words, and existing 
notions, and prevalent modes of belief of necestdty 
form the only means and channels of communicating 
the religious truths intended to be conveyed. Thus, 
in such a case the introduction of views in tliemselves 
at variance with truths since elicited, is compatible 
vnth the veracity of the inspired teacher, and the 
absence of such a knowledge as has since been 
obtained of facts which did not concern the tenour 
of his particular commission, is without difficulty 
recondleable with his inspired and in&Uible know- 
ledge of the truths which it was his province to 
communicate. 

Some veriters, indeed, have felt no repugnance 
even to the idea of an adaptation, on tlie part of an 
inspired teacher, to the prejudices and eiiorB (knovm 
by him to be such,) of his hearers; though others^ 
on the contrary, cannot conceive or allow aoch an

accomodation; regarding it as a compranise d 
integrity incompatible even with moral honesty, and 
much more with the indwelling of the spirit fif 
truth. Perhaps, however, some distinction maj bo 
allowed between the actual and formal inenlcatioa 
of such views, and their incidental adoption as a 
vehicle for other instructions. 

Representation of the Creation in ike 

But the great difficulty in the present 
from the circumstance of the same main statement 
occurring in a more brief and pointed form in the 
delivery of the Decalogue. Here it is manifest the 
same considerations Mill no longer avaiL For admis- 
sions which might be allowed with respect ton homan 
teacher divinely inspired, would not i^pty in the 
instance of a direct declaration by the Divine voice 
and actual inscription by the Divine act. 

It is needless to enlarge on the difficulties nith 
which the subject is surrounded. It involves a 
question of the most serious moment from its exten- 
sive application in theology, which is foroed upon 
us by the consideration of the present snigeet, and 
has also claimed much attention as bearing widely 
upon the character of other Divine commnnioationa 
recorded in the Bible. It amounts to tli]% — whether, 
and to what extent, wo can consistent^ bdieve the 
Deity to have adopted the course of aoeonunodating

his communications to the existing prejudices and 
belief, even when erroneous, of the parties addressed? 

Without pretending here to discuss the general 
question, I would merely ask, what is the least 
objectionable course to pursue f ' 

In every rock we trace in&llible monuments of 
the progress of creation ; we truly read the records 
in ** tables of stone inscribed with finger of CkKl,** 
When we compare those with documents of a 
different kind, we are compelled to acknowledge the 
visible inscriptions and the written representation 
to be at direct variance^ so long as the historical 
character of that representation be insisted on. The 
only alternative is to admit that it was not intended 
for an historical narrative: and if the represen- 
tation cannot have been designed for literal history^ 
it only remains to regard it as having been intended 
for the better enforcement of its objects in the 
language of figure and poetry: — and to allow that 
the manner in which the Deity was pleased to reveal 
himself to the Jews as accomplishing the work of 
creation was (like so many other points of their 
dispensation,) veiled in the guise of apologue and 
parable ; and that only a more striking representation 
of the greatness and miyesty of the Divine power 
and creative wisdom was intended by embodying 
the expression of them in the language of dramatie

Importance of tke QuedUm. 

But without insisting on these or the like sugges- 
tions as entirely satisfactory, I vrill only further 
observe in general, that with reference to prevailing 
opinions, the subject is manifestly of a nature which 
cannot be safely neglected or passed by ; but which 
all friends to truth are most imperatively called upon 
to examine fully and candidly in the present times^ 
when it is continually being brought more widelj 
into public notice. 

Its importance is, indeed, now beginning to be 
generally acknowledged. It is in vain that one 
party may endeavour to gloss over the difficulties, or 
to dismiss them with some vague general remark ; 
and another go into the minuteness of critical 
details for finding some hardly-strained verbal con- 
struction into which the phraseology of the sacred 
narrative may be tortured to effect a reconciliation ; 
or a third, seek to mislead the public by ftlse and 
absurd misrepresentations of the geological evi* 
dence. These attempts may, perhaps^ for the 
moment, obtain the assent of the unreflecting reader, 
and for a time lead blindfold the opinions of the 
many by the authority of some eminent name^ or 
supply a convenient form of words under the shelter 
of which the believer may exempt himself from the 
necessity of inquiry, and repose from the labour of 
thought, and in which the sceptic may find himself 
provided with a convenient disguise of approved and

Orthodox exposition, the flimsiness of which will 
only disclose itself in proportion to the penetration 
of those around him. 

But the success of such expedients cannot be 
lasting ; and the question must soon come to be dis- 
cussed in its naked simplicity. If such attempts at 
explanation as those alluded to have successively 
amused, for a time^ the public mind, yet that one 
has, in turn, yielded to another, shows that the pro- 
gressive disclosiu-es of geological discovery have 
tended more and more to extend the dominion of 
sound inductive principles. Nevertheless, some of 
those expositions which have recently obtained most 
popularity, have not been without their use in 
exploding the more gross errors of those which pre- 
ceded them, and in some measure preparing the way 
for the truth. Thus men's minds were formerly 
startled at the bare notion of long-continued periods 
and successive dynasties of organized life before the 
creation of man. The theory of the ^ days'* inters 
preted as periods of ** indefinite" length, had, at 
least, the recommendation that it got over one main 
part of the novelty and difficulty, and some notion 
of the immense duration of the globe became, in a 
certain degree, familiarized to men's minds as asso- 
ciated with the scripture use of the terms ** day** 
and • year.* 

They were consequently now less incapable of 
listening to the disclosures of geological researeht 
and less shocked at the boldness with which indoo-

Uon cleared its own waj, to the utter disregard of 
extraneous authority, and followed up its own eon- 
clu»ona, nitliout respect to receired opinions, pre- 
ciselv as the clear evidence of facts illumined the 
jiath to truth. 

It may also he remarked inth satisfaction that in 
some of tlie latest and now most Tridelj-circulated 
of these expositions, there has appeared a hi more 
distinct reference to the genuine authority of induc- 
tire jirinciples, an acknowledgment of its rightful 
claims within its own proTJnce. We may also per- 
ceive a diB|>ositiou to less minute attempts at precise 
interpretation, and an adoption of more vague and 
indefinite language in statements bearing at all upou 
the discrepancies. It would appear that the geolo- 
gist endeavoured to commit himself no fiirtiier than 
was absolutely necessary, while be silently passed 
by those topics on which a definite statement would 
be unavoidably offensive, and when he cleariy saw 
that all attempts at explaining it away would be 
impracticable. 

And though views not unlike those before leferred • 
to and commented upon have been at least in some 
degree adopted by several eminent geologists, yet all 
the more Judicious have carefully avoided direct and 
pointed affirmation of what they well know to be 
BO much at variance with geological evidence as the 
occurrence of an univeraal chaos folHtwcd by -»

Relatiwi of the Question to Christianity. 

But chiefly I would observe, while there is doubtless 
much to be considered in the intrinsic nature of the 
contradiction, yet that which invests them with 
all their strength as objections is the very common 
adoption of certain peculiar opinions and views of 
religion, wliich nevertheless api)ear to me far from 
essential to Christianity. 

I would maintain that the question, when regarded 
in its real character, would assume a far simpler 
aspect than it too commonly does, and would occa- 
sion no serious embarrassment in the minds of any 
thinking disciples of the gospel, whose views are 
not mixed up with the very common prepossessions 
as to the meaning and application of the Old Testar 
ment. Hence it is that men are startled at the 
announcement of the discrepancies vre have been 
considering ; and from the prevalence of those opi- 
nions alone it is that the question assumes so peeu-

Now whether or not we can vindicate the prin- 
ciple of adaptation (before referred to^) to the pecu- 
liar ideas and conditions of the parties addressed* it 
is at least clear that the representations in question 
toertf in point of fiicti as specially adapted to the 
apprehensions of the Israelites, as they are utterij 
unsuited to us at the present daj. 

But distinctions of this kind are bj no means 
generally understood among professing Christiana. 
And the extensive prevalence of pecuUar notions 
with regard to the meaning and application of tbe 
Old Testament, and esj^ecially of the Decalogue^ is 
such as to excite a strong feeling of offence at 
whatever tisnds . to throw discredit on their literal 
authority. 

To those whose views are such as to amalgamate 
together all the different parts of the Bible into one^ 
and who do not recognize the distinctions between 
the different portions of the Divine revelations^ a 
difficulty found in one part will assume the character 
of an objection to all other parts, and serionslj 
endanger the 'stability of the whole. And to those 
who have been led habitually to comlnne togetlier 
the religion of the Old Testament with that of the 
New, whatever is found to preclude the literal accep- 
tation of passages in the Books of Moses^ and in 
the law given to the Jews, will naturally assume the 
tone of a disi^aragement to their whole religion.

Til 8 contradictions directly affecting the passages 
containing the account of the seven days, whether

thoso who recognise in (xenesis the supposed pri- 
mieTal institution of that observance, the rejection 
of the histai*ical character of the j^assage of course 
destroys the main argument on which their opinion 
is built. And to those who adopt the obligations of 
the Judaical Decalogue, the difficulties must appear 
especially formidable, and little less than subversive 
of religion*. 

On the other hand, patient attention to the mani- 
fest distinctions between the several different divine 
dispensations, whether to the Jews or the patriarchs^

dictions between tlie language adopted in the Old 
Testament, and in the delivery of the Jewish law» 
and the existing evidences of the order of creation^ 
without any impeachment of the religion he pro- 
fesses. 

Systematic theologians, indeed, of several schools 
not acknowledging the spiritual simplicity of Chris- 
tianity, have too commonly distorted and disfigured 
its heavenly features by an incongruous admixture 
partly of human conceits, partly of the peculiaritiei 
of the Judaical, or even, perhaps^ earlier dispen- 
sations. 

But a more simple and direct inquiry into the 
religion of the New Testament seems to me to lead 
with increasing clearness to the conviction that su<^ 
views are but i)erversions of its real spirit And 
from such perversion alone it is that Christianitj 
can ever be exposed to datiger, or its credit in the 
least affected by the circumstance that language at 
variance with wliat is now known for physical truths 
was employed in the delivery of their law to the 
Jews, or in recounting to them the records of an 
earlier age, in passages on which nothing in the new 
and spiritual religion of the gospel is anywhere made 
to depend by its Divine founder or his apostles.

length than the real simplicity of the case would 
call for, if men were disposed to view it in its real

opposes the admission of rational views of the

traced the dependence of natural theology upon the 
conclusions of inductive science; and contended 
for the necessity of natural theology as the foundap

GENERAL CONCLUSION. 



Throughout tbo \rhoIe of the foregoing discussion, 
in illustrating the mutual relation and reaction 
between pliysical science, natural theology, and 
revealed religion, we have referred much to the 
various misapprehensions which prevail respecting 
such connexion among the several branches of the 
inquiry. We have referred especially to the fears 
entertained for the safety of religion, and the expe* 
dients resorted to for obviating the supposed danger; 
—expedients as futile as the alarms are groundless. 
We have commented on the hostility felt against 
science, and the dread of free inquiry ; the disparage- 
ment of natural theology, and of physical inquiry as 
its basis, which are dictated by the adherence to the 
narrowest and most unworthy views of the tenour of 
revelation. While the rejection of the physical 
evidences of creation on the one hand, and the 
attempts to accommodate the Hebrew Scriptures to 
them on the other, display an unhappy perplexity of 
ideas, whether as to the principles of interpretation, 
or to the character and objects of the different parts 
of the sacred writings. 

We have adverted to the causes which have led to 
the adoption of these views : if we look to the cofutf-

quences of encouraging guch a spirit, it is evident 
that its ineiitable results Trill bo anything but so^ 
viceable to the true interests of Christianitj. The 
followers of these systems may persuade themselTes 
they are powerfully upholding religion, whilst, in 
reality, they are only thus exposing themselTes and* 
their cause to increased suspicion among its avowed 
enemies, and with many who are desirous to be ita 
friends. 

Such narrow views and flimsy speculations insisted 
on as necessary to the support of the Christian reli- 
gion, can only tend to throw discredit on its evi- 
dences, or be regarded as betraying a secret mis* 
giving as to their soundness, in the minds of its 
professed disciples. 

If such a spirit increase and gain ground among 
the friends of religion, and continue to be inculcated 
and urged by its advocates, it is manifest that in the 
temper of the present times, whether by one course 
or another, it must equally lead to the very object 
they are so anxious to strive against, the wider and 
deeper eaiension ofirrdigUm. 

Attempts to oppose rational inquiry and free dis- 
cussion have always been as vain and fritile in them^ 
selves, as i)emicious to real Christianity. Whenever 
they have partially succeeded, it has only been, on the 
one hand, in producing general hypocrisy, ill conceal- 
ing irreligious licentiousness; or, on the other, in 
setting faith and philosophy in open hostility : and 
thus science, from being in its proper way, the

powerful auxiliary, has been converted into the 
enemy, of religion, only by the ill-judged zeal of its 
friends. By a perversion of Christianity they alienate 
from it those who would be its best and most 
enlightened supporters, and professedly setting them- 
* selves in array against knowledge, they appear to 
make open confession that religion must be esta^ 
blished on the basis of ignorance ; and, as far as they 
can, force it into an unnatural alliance with darkness 
rather than light. 

Such inquiries as those we have here been endea- 
vouring to elucidate, point to a widely extended 
connexion and dependence, subsisting between the 
truths of natural and revealed theology; between 
the manifestations of the Divinity in the natural and 
moral creation, in the order and design of the phy- 
sical world, and in those spiritual revelations of the 
most elevated kind which we find in Scripture; 
between the two books in which, (as Bacon* has 
observed,) Divine communications are alike vouch- 
safed to us, the volume of nature and the page of 
inspiration. The points of analogy between the two 
departments of inquiry are, indeed, peculiarly striking, 
and most worthy to bo more diligently studied and 
practically applied than they seem to have been. 
The discussion of them would form the appropriate 
sequel to the foregoing essay ; and such a sequel I 
have immediately in contemplation.

For the present I will doee with a verj brief 
recapitulation. 

It has been our object to show that the order and 
dependence of fixed law8» and general prindples» 
constitutes our notion of physical cause and eflFect. 
And it is from the arrang^nent and STuimetrj of 
these principles^ or causes, that we ascend to the 
great source of order and^hannony : from the facta 
of physical causation to the Infinite marai cause, 
ordaining and animating the entire system of them. 

Physical science is the necessary foundation of 
natural theology : certain of the truths it disdosea 
are warnings against mistaking the purport of 
Scripture; and the right use of the caution thua 
inculcated, applies widely in the interpretation of 
roTclation. Inductive philosophy is subservient both 
to natural and revealed religion. The investigation 
of God*s works is an essential introduction to the 
right reception of his word. 

The conclusions of natural theology are limited in 
extent, but demonstrative in proof: they are most 
important in themselves ; and indispensable in the 
foundations of any evidence of revelation. Ita 
truths elevate science into fiuth, while its deficiencies 
evince the necessity for further illuminlition : it 
tends to inculcate humility and to excite inquiry : 
and where it shows the path of reason to be dosed* 
it points to the brighter opening of inqnration. .

To the logical reader, the object of the whole discussioQ in 
this section may be expkuncd in a word ; induction (in its 
physical sense) is the process of collecting the ecidenee for 
the truth of the premisa of the syllogism into which logic 
analyzes the reasoning. Our present question refers more 
especially to that which is at once the most diflScult and 
important part, the evidence for the mcjar. — See Akcb- 
Bisiiop What£ly'*8 Ijogicj pp. 207 And 228. 

The mistake of some writers in supposing that in the 
enthymematic form, the suppressed premiss is the mimor^ 
seems to me not improbably traced to the view they appear 
to adopt, that the perfect case of induction would be that 
in which etery individual was examined ; the less accurate 
when only a few. Yet as we have observed above^ the last 
are the only cases in which any reasofiing takes place. 

Logic being nothing else than the theory of concItMtoa- 
ness^ includes in its analysis the reasoning which takes place 
in induction as well as in all other cases. It is from a total 
misconception, therefore, that the dialectic and inductive 
are often represented as two rival methods on the one hand^ 
or expected to be auxiliaries on the other. 

It may, perhaps, be necessary here to remark that the 
word ** analogy,^ which so frequently occurs in this discus- 
sion, is invariably used by me in the simple sense of a

paralielism or correspondence between two sett of things 
or events, which may have no nmiiariiy or resemblance 
whatever ; analogy is a similarity of relation merely, not 
of qualities. Those readers to whom the distinction may 
not be familiar, are referred for a full and luminous expo- 
sition of the whole case to the notes on Bishop CoPLEsroM^s 
Inquiry into the Doctrines of Necessity^ bCf p. 122; or 
to Archbishop Whately'^s Logic, p. 168. 

The reader will find an excellent brief summary of the 
nature of induction in the Introduction to Da. Hampden^s 
Bampton Lectures, 1837> p. 29. 

The view here taken of induction and phyncal analogy 
is admirably illustrated in the following masterly passage 
of Laplace:— 

** L'*induction, Fanalogie, des hypotheses fond^ sur let

est cette probability."** — Laplace, JSmos PhUoiopkique 
sur les ProbabilUiSf pp. 1G&— I78. 

With regard to the importance of analogical conddera- 
tions, as the guides of inductive research (above spoken of), 
we shall, perhaps, be reminded (as has been often said,) 
that the most important philosophical discoveries have been 
made by chance. It was, however, the observatioQ ct 
D^Alembert, ** Ces hazards ne sont que pour oeux qui 
jouent bien.^ And it seems to me a still more just view ct 
the matter that the chances happen to all alike, though a 
few only know how to make use of them : via., those who 
are thoroughly possessed with just views of natural an«- 
logics.

To expose the various and most preposterous perversioiis at

requires to be peculiarly impressed oo them, namely, to 
acquaint themselves, in some moderate dq^ree, with the 
general nature of the subject, l)efore tbej adduce detached 
points of objection as fatal to the whole train of conclusions. 

To take, however, an instance of the kind of objection 
alluded to : one geologist dwells oo the uncertainty attend- 
ing a positive distinction of particular formations from their 
mineral characters alone, and inasts oo the attainment of 
certainty only from their characteristic fossil remains. 
Another remarks that, in some particular cases, conrider- 
able ambiguity attaches to the determination of fossil 
remains, and that those really bdonging to different forma- 
tions may, in some instances, be confounded together. 
Hence the objector contends that the argument '< halts oo 
both its legs,^ and triumphs in his inference that there can 
be no certainty at all in the science ! In other words, 
because either source of evidence alone may be defective, 
therefore both together cannot be satisfactory. Or again, 
because, in some instances, there may be confessed ambigui- 
ties in the interpretation, therefore in no case can there 
be any certainty. A passage is sometimes cited from 
Cuvier^s account of his researches on fossQ bones, in which 
he, with all the caution of a true philosopher, carefully 
insists on all the sources of fallacy by which his inquiries 
were liable to be affSccted; and speaks, with becoming 
modesty, of his conclusions, as often being far removed 
from the evidence of demonstration. And this u then con- 
strued by the sceptic into a confession that the whole science 
has no solid foundation, and is little more than a system of 
gratuitous hypotheses ! 

It would be useless to dwell further on such speculatioos. 
I should not, perhaps, have noticed them at all, had they 
not recently received a certain stamp of respectability from 
their association with the name of a writer of old repute^

LoED Brougham in his Discourse on Natural Theologf/^ in 
a note on Cause and Effect, after stating the nature, and 
upholding the soundness (as far as it goes,) of Hume^s doo- 
trine of causation, yet contends that something more is 
necessary to a complete view of the subject. Besides the 
notion of invariable sequence, he maintains we have also a 
^* belief that the one event occasions the other ; that there 
is between the two a connexion beyond the mere rdation of 
junction and sequence, and that the pveceding event exerts 
an influence, a force, a power, over the other, and producea 
the otber.^— p. 228. 

And the grounds of this belief, he oootends, are to be 
found in the proofs, 1st, of the invariable sequence; Shid, 
of the condition that ** not only must the second event 
always have been found to follow the first, bat the second 
must never have been observed without the first preceding 
it, or at least without some other preceding it, in wUch case 
the causation is predicated alike of both these preceding 
events.^ — ^p. Si20.

always follows the other, and tliat it ceases when the other 
ceases.^ But besides this, 3d, << Our minds form, whether 
we will or no, another idea, not merely that of constant con- 
nexion or succession, but of the one exerting a power over 
the other by an inherent force ; and this is the idea of cau- 
sation. Whence do we derive it ? I apprehend only from 
our consciousness. We feel that we have a will and a 
power,'* ice 

He then traces the effects originating in our volition 
which we can produce on material objects around us, and 
contends that we hence form our notion of causation as 
above defined. That we do thus obtain an idea of causa- 
tion is, I conceive, perfectly unquestionable ; but it refers 
solely to one speciea : viz., that which by our voluntaiy 
agency produces effects on matter subject to us ; or what I 
have termed moral causation. The author does not pursue 
this point any further, so as to show how or whether at all 
the notion applies to physical causes and effects. This is 
what I have attempted to do above. We transfer the idea 
by a fair analogy to other cases of animal power, and to 
instances in which we trace the marks of intelligence ; but 
only by a vague, imaginary, and deludve one, to the suc- 
cession of physical events, or their dependence one oo 
another. 

The author proceeds to discuss the idea of necessary 
connexion which (m the sense of i priori necessity,) is 
certainly excluded by this view of causes ; since ** the 
whole is a question of fad, of contingent truth.^ But be 
maintains that ** our ideas of power and of causation are 
solid and well-founded, although they only refer to a power 
or a causation which may or may not exist** In this I 
entirdy concur, especially when viewed in connexion 
the distinctions here laid down.

Tus achromatism of the eye is m subject which has 
sioned much discussion, and that of a remarkable kind. 
The most eminent optical writers have been directly opposed 
in opinion as to the fact. And those who have admitted 
tlie/ac/, have yet held it unaccountable^ and have sought 
indirect explanations of it as being, strictly speaking, 
impassible in theory. 

I have (as I believe for the first time,) shown that it is 
perfectly passible in theory^ whilst it may or may not be 
the fact in different individual cases. I mention this the 
more as the drift of my investigations have been strangdy 
misconceived by some. They are given in one of the aeries

The extreme confusion which has been introduced into dis- 
cussions of this nature, owing to the ambiguity of the term 
** cause,**^ has been ably exposed by several writers. The 
same point has been dwelt upon by Mr. Irons, [On Final 
Causes^ p. 53,] who has examined largely the various ops- 
nions of ancient and modem writers on the subject, and has 
discussed the views of Hume and others with regard to the 
nature of causation. With so extensive a knowledge of 
philosophical authors, (to judge from his quotations,) it 
seems strange that he has omitted all refereiioe to the

physical part of the subject, and has not been led to the 
distinction on which I have so particularly dwelt between the 
physical and the moral senses of the term *' cause.^ He 
has, in fact, confined himself throughout to the idea of an 
operative agency, or what I have called *< moral causation;^* 
and considers all idea of causation as including that of an 
efficient influence; defining a cause to be ^ that which of 
itself makes any thing begin to be,"** (pp. 74, 79> &^») <usd 
which is, in fact, intelligence. 

Proceeding, then, on such an idea of causes, and omitting 
all reference to the great argumentfrom physical causes, in 
the sense in which I have explained them, it is not sur* 
prising that this author should disparage to the uttermost 
the argument from final causes, of which he takes so un- 
happily contracted a view. He has, however, clearly dis- 
tinguished the boundary between our knowledge of the bare 
fact of fitness or adjustment in created beings and their 
properties, and the inference of design and intelligence. 
The former, he shows, was the strict sense in which alone 
the ancient philosophers spoke of ** final causes.^ Among 
other points, he particularly refers (p. 125,) to a circum- 
stance related by Mr. Campbell, the missionary ; that on 
showing a watch to some savages, they were by no means 
able to infer design ; this example has, in fact, been much 
dwelt upon, and regarded as decisive against the efficiency 
of Paley^s argument But I would ask were the savages 
able to reason in any other case ? or to make inferences at 
all ? This must obviously be shown before the case can be 
of the slightest avail to the argument. Paley, I apprehend, 
never contemplated the reasoning as addressed to savages.

Thb following passage supplies a good example of the 
extraordinary ideas which, in some instances, prevail with 
respect to the bearing of the study of physical, on final. 



<< But, it is rejdned, you explain every thing by your 
omnipotent gravitation, — what is the origin of that? I 
answer, this too we know full welL The daughter of the 
old blind Fate, — her servants, magnitude, number, and pro- 
portion, — her inheritance, a universe without a God, which 
requires no God. . . . When the great astronomer Lalande 
denied a Deity, could trace in the heavens no God, in the 
movement of the stars no finger of God, we are oompdkd 
to allow the logical consequence of his reasoning. That 
high order and adaptation of end and means is only the pro- 
duct of the rigid mechanism of necessary physical laws; 
tliere, above, is only a blind mindless destiny, the absolute 
ruler of its universe. But I appeal to the truth of the 
saying in St. John,^-In the spirit only shall we worship God; 
and in what only our science is for mind, is its dignity and 
value to be found. He only can style the order of the 
universe an adaptation of means to end, who brings to its 
observation a belief in the reality of design. But the true 
interpretation of the order of design lies far more deariy 
apparent in the mind of man. The infinite Spirit does not 
bail itself under proportion and number ! The pUy with

object of which is to prove that the highest mathematical 
or physical talent does not confer, nay, even impairs, the 
power of reasoning on other subjects ; of this the passage 
quoted certainly supplies a remarkably strong instance, 
(though not, I believe, contemplated in that light by the 
reviewer,) if the author be really entitled to the mathematical 
reputation which he is said to bear in Grermany. 

This mass of confusion of ideas would be at once cleared 
away by a slight attention to those distinctions which I have 
endeavoured to indicate. 

It appears to me that the attempt to de6ne the term 
<< blind fate,^ or ** necessity,^ would at once decide all 
questions of this sort. I can attach no meaning to it which 
is not at once contradictory to the notion of design. Blind 
fate could not produce adaptation to an end ; if it oouM it 
would no longer be blind fate but eternal providence. 

We may take for another example the remark of an 
extremely well-intentioned writer:— 

<< It is manifest that the mineral geology, considered as a 
science, can do as well without God (though on a questioii 
concerning the origin of the earth,) as Lucretius did.^— 
Pekn, Comparative EHimate^ 4r^. 

If geology proceeded by any other course than that of the 
independent study of << minerals,^ it would neither be ^ a 
science,^ nor could it afford the slightest proof of a Deity. 
It investigates *< a question concerning the origin of the 
earth j^ without making any aeeumpiUm of a Creator; and 
that investigation leads to the most decisive proof of a 
Creator^ which would be no proof but an argument in a 
circle, if it had aeeumed a Creator in the first instance. It 
is sufficient to add with r^ard to Lucretius, that to bin 
those proofs were whoUy unknown.

agents within our observation.

plainness of style and absence of profound metaphysical 
speculation which characterize Paley**s writings as originating 
in the manifest design he all along entertained, and so 
successfully pursued, of putting the whole argument in a 
perfectly popular form, so as to place it within the grasp of 
the most limited or least cultivated understanding. This 
ooottderation appears to me to afford at once a perfectly 
satisfactory vindication of Paley, if he had not entered into 
the details of the question. But I cannot help thinking 
that in this (as in some other instances,) the Regius Pro- 
fessor has been somewhat too severe on the noble author. 
The fact certainly does appear to me, upon the most careful 
review of the passages adduced, to be much in favour of 
the justice of Lord Brougham^s complaint of the omission 
of an exacts philosophical discussion of the point in ques- 
tion. That the omission was designed^ and wisely designed, 
in reference to Paley^s particular object, does not affect the 
question of its being an omission, when considered in a 
strictly metaphysical light The precise point of the infer- 
ence of mind is rather asserted than proved, rather illusiraied 
than rigidly anatyMcd. It is a subject worthy of nnore 
profonnd investigation than I have happened to find bestowed 
upon it* So far as the doctrine of causatum is concerned 
I may venture to hope that the illustrations conveyed in 
these pages may not be useless towards supplying the 
deficiency. At any rate it is one of the most valuaUe points 
of Lord Brougham^s Discourse, that it urges attention to 
thu particular question with so much force smA originaUty.

ooune of some remarks od necessary coonexion» refers to the 
doctrine of a first cause ; contending thai the idea of runwi 
tioo which we derive from our volition (before r e fe r r e d to^) 
is eueniial to that doctrine. Had we not sudi an idesy 
that of ^ power or causslity could never have been obtained 
bj us from any observation of the sequences of events. The 
idea of design or contrivance in like manner must have been 
wanting to us ; and hence I cannot understand how, but for 
the consciousness of power, we could ever have been led to 
the bdief in the existence of a first cause.** — (P. 831.) 

If we take the term causation in the sense to which I have 
above referred, of moral causation, the justness of these 
remarks will be fully admitted; that distinction has not 
been introduced by the author.

This prejudice against what is called the pride of science, 
as an impious intrusion on forbidden ground, is predsdj 
that expressed by Pliny, when speaking of Hipparchus 
forming his catalogue of the stars ; he says, — ^* Ausus 
rem etiam Deo improbam annumerare posteris stdlai.** 
I have commented upon the influence of such prejudices 
in my HUtory of Science^ in the Cabinet Cyclop€BJ^a^

The celebrated controversy between Newton and Leibnits 
was disgraced by the attempt of the latter to fix upon the 
doctrines of hu great rival the charge of a tendency to 
materialism and atheism. The malicious character of such 
an attempt was equalled only by tlie absurdity which must 
manifestly attach to it in the eyes of any one who had read 
Newton^s writings. Groundless as such a charge was, yet it 
tended much to keep up the prejudices which for a long 
while prevailed against the reception of the Newtonian 
theory ; and received support from the readiness with which 
the generality of men cling to the authority of a distinguished 
name, especially if it sanction them in rejecting any new 
doctrines, which are always distasteful to the mass of man- 
kind simply because they are new and require thought, and 
perhaps the surrender of established ideas. To such sources 
we may perhaps traoe the prevalence of still-lingering piw* 
judices against physical philosophy in general as having 
a tendency to cherish intellectual vanity, and a spirit bostik 
to the inculcation of rdigious truth.

Visws nmilar to those here stated have the miction of 
of the highest philosophical authorities. Thus Aristotle 
in his treatise^ De Mundi^ cap. vi^ r epre s en ts it as

Boyle observes, ^ As it more recommends the skill of aa

need nothing to reach his ends in it, but the contrivance of 
parts void of understanding, than if it were necessary that 
ever and anon a discreet servant should be employed to 
concur notably to the operations of this or that part, or to 
hinder the engine from being out of order; so it more sets 
off the wisdom of Grod in the fabric of the universe that he 
can make so vast a machine perform all those many things 
which he designed it should, by the mere contrivance of 
brute matter, managed by certain laws of motion and uphdd 
by his ordinary and general concourse, than if be employed

interpoBition it requires. The perfection of every jneoe of

the designed purpose without bestowing further labour 
upon it^ 

That an opposite feeling should prevail in a poet is not 
surprising, and we trace it in the Dunciad^ canto iv. L 474.

should have been objected to bj m phihiopher like DugaM 
Stewart, who condemns them in no measured terms as 
^ absurd C* And this upon the idea that it would be unworthy 
of the Deity to employ a machinery of second causes, becaU$e 
machinery among men is avowedly introduced to save labour 
and accomplish the purpose in view moie easily and com- 
pletdy, which of course cannot apply to the designs of 
Omnipotence.— PAt/osopAy of Mind^ iL 555. But the real 
question obviously refers to the machinery, not for the work 
it does, but for the 9kill displayed in its construction and 
operation ; the proofs of which are unquestionably str o n ger, 
as it requires less manual interferenoe. 

The following passage from one of the most eminent of 
Newton^s followers u worthy of careful consideration :-^ 
** As we cannot but conceive the universe as depending on 
the first cause and chief mover, whom it would be abrard, 
not to say impious, to exclude from acting in it; so we have 
some hints of the manner in which he operates in nature, 
from the laws -which we find established in it. Though he 
b the source of all efficacy, yet we find that place is left for 
second catues to act in subordination to him ; and mechanism 
has its share in carrying on the first scheme of nature. The 
establishing the equality of action and reaction, even in those 
powers which seem to surpass mechanism, and to be more 
immediately derived from him, seems to be an ItwIV ^tVm 
that those powers, while they derive their efficacy from bin, 
are however in a certain degree circumscribed and regulated

Newton conjectured, the whole efficacy of this medium must

may be subject to the like laws as other elastic fluids in its 
actions and vibrations; and that if its nature were better 
known to us we might make curious and useful discoveries 
concerning its eflecu from these laws. It is easy to see that 
this conjecture no way derogates from the government and 
influences of the Deity, while it leaves us at liberty to pursue 
our inquiries concerning the nature and operations of sodi 
a medium ; whereas they who hastily resolve these powers 
into immediate volitions of the Supreme Cause, widioiit 
admitting any intermediate instruments, put an end to our

In support of these and the like views, the writings of poets 
are frequently appealed to, and with good reason, as such 
ideas are properly congenial to the region of poetry ; — ^the 
error lies in mistaking them for philosophy. Thus a weQ- 
known and justly admired passage of Cowper, (TVmIp, 
book y. L 7^0,) is often cited in confirmation of the opinioo 
above adverted to. If thus applied, it involves the fallacy 
in reasoning here exposed. The writings of that amiahlft 
poet in general, are a favourite authority with a considerable 
party for their disparagement both of natiural theology and 
of physical science ; a subject on which it must be manifrst^ 
the expressions of a poet, and especially one of Cowper*s 
tone of mind and general acquirements, cannot be regarded 
asof any weight. 

In the productions of another school, whose views border 
dosely on the poetical, and would be unexceptionable if 
honestly proposed as such, we find similar sentiments uphdd. 
One specimen is referred to in p. StSy. In the same 
publication we are warned that ** they who interpret not 
what men call nature by the Bible^ will bring down the 
BiUe to the standard of nature;^ and that ^'thcj who 
rescdve every thing into secondary or physical causes^ and 
will not see Him who is the cause of all causes, and worketh 
by all those things whose operation meets our senses^ will 
lose all sense for discerning His hand when Scripture plainly 
declares it^— Dr. Putty *s Sermon^ p. 8. If they did not 
resolve everything into secondary causes^ they could not 
arrive at any evidence of the first; nor again find the prools 
of the truth of Scriptuie.

This strange confusbn of ideas pervades the whole of the

Thx following incident, involving the opinions of two 
eminent scholars is given by the learned author of the 
Parriana : — ** I had once the pleasure of driving the doctor 
(Parr,) a few miles into the country to visit a former pupfl. 
When we returned together it was a bright starlight nigiht, 
and the beauty of the scene over our heads led me to ask 
him, with reference to the Mosaic record, how long, in his 
opinion, those orbs had rolled and glittered. He made some 
remarks on the term (created,) employed by the sacred 
penman, distinguishing between creation, strictly understood, 
and formatioo, or putting the then chaos into its present 
order. I did not then admire the distinction which throws 
back the creation to an indefinite period, and thrusts the 
Creator from what seems his proper place; and if Moaea 
should fail us here, and the same mode of criticism be 
adopted in other parts of Scripture, I fear we shall have no 
proof of the creation of a maUnriiU world at least.* 

I am not quite aware to what date this anecdote bdongs,

{eology was so decisive as it has since become. But under

As by far the dearest, shortest, and most explidt statement 
of the most recent Bibliahgeokgical views referred to^ whidi 
I have seen, I will mention an article in the Magaasine of 
Popular Science^ No. 12, January, ISS/f bearing the 
signature of J. P. S., which I believe are the initials of an 
eminent and learned dissenting divine. I refer particularly 
to this paper, as coocdving it may possess considerable 
weight with many persons; while the tone and sprit in 
whidi it is written is such as will secure it an impartial 
perusal from all parties. 

The question respecting the description of the creation ia 
brought into the shortest compass by looking at the predae 
statement whidi the author gives of his own views; he 
concdves,-^ 

1st That **the beginning^ means an indefinitdy long 
period during which the successive formations recognised bj 
geology may have taken place. 

Sdly. ** That at a recent epoch our planet was brought 
into a state of disorganization, detritus, or ruin, (perhi^ 
we have no perfecUy appropriate term,) from a former 
conditkm.*

Sdlj. That out of this condition the existing creation 
took place, literally, as described, in six natural days. 

The author has also expressed his positive conviction that 
any real contradiction of the Scripture account by geological 
phenomena must at once involve the refection of the truth 
of the whole Bible. But he contends that the above inter- 
pretation removes all discrepancy, and thus secures us from 
the consequences otherwise fatal to rdigion. 

He does not appear to be aware that the second of the 
positions above assumed is precisely that which is absolutdy 
contradicted by all geological evidence. 



Great weight has been attributed to certain 
remarks by Dr. Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew, 
(inserted as a note in Dr. Buckland'^s Bridgewater Treaiiee^ 
vol. L p. 84,) on the interpretation of those expressions in 
the 1st chapter of Genesis, which bear most upon the 
Biblico-geological views. 

While I most readily acknowledge the critical value of 
remarks coming from so eminent an authority in Hebrew 
literature, I cannot perceive that anything substantial is 
gained by them in support of the geological version of the 
passage ; or, in other words, the hypothesis that Moses was 
inspired to teach geology either to the Isradites or to us. 

It appears, in the first place, from Dr. Pusey^s statements, 
that the original word rendered *' created,^ does not neces- 
sarily imply the idea of an actual calling into existence out 
of nothing. This, indeed, does away with the commonly 
received Scripture proof of that prevalent opinion, but bears 
very little upon any geological diiUculty. 

In the next place, the separation of the two first verses, as 
account of a prinueval formatioo, is ffpniMfffd by

Dr. Puaey to be justified od critical grounds, and m 
hiitocy of the existing creation conttdered to beg^ with the 
third verse. 

This (as I have already observed,) appears to me still to 
leave the main contradiction untoudied; however, the 
learned author considers thb question of punctuation to be 
important, and confirms it by an appeal to the opinions of 
old writers, and to the mode of division adopted in some 
early translation of the Bible ; he adds, — ** This then is just 
the sort of confirmation which one wished for, because, though 
•one would shrink from the impiety of bending the language of 
God's Book to any other than its obvious meaning, we can- 
not help fearing lest we might be unconsciously influenced 
by the floating opinions of our own day, and therefore turn 
the more anxiously to those who explained Holy Scripture 
before those theories existed. You must allow me to add» 
that I would not define further. We know nothing of 
creation, nothing of ultimate cau$e9, nothing of spaoe^ 
except what is bounded by actual existing bodies; nothing 
of time, but what is limited by the revolution of those bodies^ 
I should be sorry to dogmatize upon that of whidi it 
requires very little reflection or reverence to confess that we 
are necessarily ignorant * Hardly do we guess arig|ht of 
things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the 
things that are before us; but the things that are in Heaven

I must observe that, in the expressions here quoted, there 
is a certain ambiguity which seems to leave them with m 
meaning somewhat dependent on the reader^s own turn of 
thought If the << floating opinions^ and the << theories^ of 
the day mean those of the Bible-gedogy school, I most cor- 
dially agree with the learned author in his dislike of themi

ject which they could not have had in view, nnce it was one 
of which they were altogether necessarily ignorant. Nor 
again am I able distinctly to understand in what manner the 
latter clause of the paragraph bears upon the question. I 
entirely agree with the author in his remarks on our ideas of 
ultimate causes, space^ and time ; but I know not to what 
dogmatizing he alludes on these points, in any geological 
speculations. Even the Bible-geologists in their theory of 
the ** days^ understood as ages, surely do not dogmatize on 
any notions of time or qpace. Still less do rational geok>- 
gists refer to any metaphysical distinctions of the kind. 
They merely affirm the succession in order of time^ of 
deposits which are arranged one on another; and of the 
respective races of animals entombed in them. The quota- 
tion adduced at the end seems to me to refer rather to thecv 
logical than to physical subjects, and to put a check on 
inquiries directed not to the structure of the earth, but to 
the mysteries of heaven.

Amomo the numerous publications on the question of the

(unlike most of his contemporarica,) is evidently qualified

OD rdigious grounds. He lia% in fact, in the fint imtance^ 
taken the very same genenl tenoor of obsenration as that 
of the present discussion ; lefierring^ in particukr, to the 
strong and unanswerable aigament of the absence of all 
indications which must hate been left of any universal 
chaos in a oomparativdj recent period, followed by a simul- 
taneous creation. He has adduced the unquestionable bctm 
of the co-existence of recent with extinct species in the later 
tertiary formations ; and has put in the most pointed man- 
ner, the irresistible concluaon that the supposed ^ last great 
change, neither preceded nor was coeval with the formatioQ 
of the newer pliocene ; nor could it possibly have succeeded, 
that formation.^ (p. 15.) He avowedly passes by the 
question *< how any universal inguigitation of the land could 
be brought to pass,"* and hints at the utter impossibilitiea 
which are involved in any hypothesis of this kind. 

In supporting these plain inferences from CmIs, he has 
given the valuable testimony of a professed and strenuous 
advocate of rdigion to the necessity of ixmestly rejecting 
all those temporizing expedients and unworthy suppressions 
or disguisings of the truth, which have been so commonly 
practised. 

In attempting to supply the deficiencies, as he thus con- 
siders them, of the theory of a recent universal change cor- 
responding to the Mosaic creation, he is not equally happy^ 
nor very consistent with the vpint of his previous remarka. 
He adopts, in general, the notion of the ^ days^ meaning 
indefinite periods ; but in the particular details seems to me 
not more felicitous nor satisfactory than any of his prede- 
cessors, in the vain and revolting attempt to lower and 
destroy the majestic imagery of the sublimest compositioii 
in the world ; and by the introduction of a literalinng 
interpretation, to torture the whole representation into m 
e which it never could have been intended to bear.

Om the question of geology and Scripture, the reader will 
find some interesting remarks in an article on the ** Recent 
Progress of Geology,** be, by Dr. T. Thomson, inserted in 
Dr. R. Thomson^s British Annual far 1838. 

Observations on such a subject, coming from a writer so 
pre-eminently distinguished in chemistry and the kindred 
sciences, will be duly valued. And of the general ezcd- 
lence of their scope and tenour, I willingly express my con- 
viction. Did they come from a less eminent authority, I 
would not stop to notice what strikes me as defective in soma 
parts of the reasoning. But in the present instance, my 
desire to see such a subject treated solely on the unawailsblt 
grounds of truth, must be my excuse for alluding to one or 
two points which seem to me open to objection. 

At the commencement of the concluding portion of hb 
article (p. 259,) the author says :-^ 

^ It has been a£Brmed by some wrong-headed cur fanatical 
individuals, that the facts disclosed by geology are incon- 
sutent with the Mosaic account of the creation ; and on 
that account attempts have been made to discourage the 
cultivation of geology,* tic. 

Here I must confess either I do not apprehend the mean- 
ing, or else the author must be including himsdf under his 
own censure, since the views he has just before been btoadi- 
ing evince most indi^Hitably those very contradiotioiis 
which he here describes as affirmed by << some wrong-headed 
or fanatical individuala.^ 

However, he next makes some exodlent observations on 
the objects of revelation as totally distinct from those of

I can only refer to the considerations adverted to in the 
third section. We do not yet know what secondary meana 
may have been employed to bring about those successive 
creations of species, or modi6cations of the forms of orga- 
nized life. The author also employs, for the same purpose^ 
the doctrine of equivocal generation. The recent researchea 
of Ehrenberg^ have, at least, thrown great doubt on that 
doctrine.

parUcuIar* as subversive of religion ; via., Mr. Cole^ in a tract 
addressed as a letter to Professor Sedgwick, but in which 
he devotes two pages to myself and my fearful heterodoxies. 
Of all the writers of this school with whose works I have 
happened to meet, this author appears by far the moH 
rational and cansisieni. He follows out his principles to 
their logical extent ; insisting rigidly on the very letter of 
every part of Scripture as applying universally, he contenda 
not only for the historical nature of the description of the 
creation, but for the obligation of the Sabbath, and for 
absolute predestination. The very title, implying that geo- 
logy, if true, is destructive to the whole truth of reveU- 
tioo, is a startling assertion. And the whole volume is full 
of such doctrines ; that to maintain geology is, in fact, infi- 
delity. That scientific and inspired truth are essentially 
hostile to each other ; and so incompatible, that one or the 
other must be rejected, be., concesflons which can but give 
a palpable triumph to scepticism.

In the able article in the Edinburgh Review^ (Na cxxxL) 
on Dr. BuckUuKTs Bridgewater Treatue, some remarks are 
made on the geological discrepancies with Scripture^ and the 
prevailing views respecting them, which appear to me to 
suggest matter fcnr more consideration than the reviewer 
seems disposed to bestow on the subject, — to those who 
desire toseeii treated an the basis of truth. 

The article throughout exhibits the most luminous and 
philosophical views of the scientific part of the inquiry ; 
the writer, however, seems anxiously to avoid any prsdse

diiciitsion of the theological difllcultiei; and, in fact, Ailfiilly 
eludes all such questions by appealing in forcible terms to 
the existing satisfaction of public opinion in Soodand en 
these points, as resting on interpretations now uniTeraally 
received ; and then, going off into an eloquent view of the 
general scope and design of revdation as distinct finom 
scientific objects, he there leaves the matter. Yet in die 
representation thus nwde^ slight and general as it is, there 
seems to me much of interest and demanding notice in oon- 
nexion with the object of the present work. 

After a luminous historical sketdi of the pi o grcsa of 
geological views, the controversies whidi prevailed, die 
hostility once excited among the Scottish clergy against the 
new science, and the gradual cessation of that opposttioo, 
the present situation of affairs is thus described (p. 14) :— 
** After having for half a century * stumbled on the dark 
mountains,^ the Church is now feeding her flock on the 
green pastures of the Huttonian geology. She recognises 
as an impregnable truth the great principle tat whidi 
Hutton and Playfair were proscribed, and has commanded 
the sacred scholar to accommodate his philology to the 
Huttonian interpretation of the language of Moses.^ Now^ 
not to dwell upon the somewhat singular kind of spritual 
pasture here assigned to the Christian flock, I oonfiess I 
neither understand liow the Church succeeds in enforcing 
this command on the sacred scholar; nor what sort of 
*' philology,'*' can effect the accommodation required* I]have 
before adverted to the various philological attemptSp which 
are all manifest failures, not only in principle but even in 
their critical details. I have also pointed out the actual 
force of the contradictions ; and at the same time^ as appears 
to me, the entire independence of Christianity with reqied 
to them. To apply such considerations, it would seem, must 
involve peculiar difficulty in the case of a church whoae

formularies (I bdiere,) are grounded upon a very express 
adoption of the obligations of the Old Testament dispen- 
sation, and especially of the Sabbath, in accordance with 
the dogmas of the Westminster Assembly. Notwithstand- 
>ogf l>7 9ome means, it seems, so completely has this accom- 
modation been brought about, to the satisfaction at least of 
all inquirers in Scodand, that the reviewer says of Dr. 
Buckland^s chapter on the subject, — *^ To us in Scotland it 
seemed a work of supererogation :^ the question had been 
^ discussed to exhaustion during the Scottish controversy 
between the rival theories. Even the pious Professor of 
Divinity in our university had adopted the explanatioa 
given by the Huttonians, and the public mind was equally 
tranquillixed.^ — ^p. 15. 

The precise nature of the explanation given by the 
Huttonians, and adopted by the Professor of Divinity, does 
not appear. However, that the public mind should have 
been tranquillized on the subject is not surprising. The 
great mass of nominal believers doubtless looked on the 
disclosures of geology with consternation and horror as long 
as they were told that its doctrines were subversive of religioci 
by those who ought to know. The Professor of Divinity 
had but to ailopt the ** Huttonian explanation,^ and the 
Church to enjoin on its ministers the use of a correspoodinff 
<<pliilology,^ and the public thus enlightened, immediatdy 
ceased from their outcries, either against geology, or ao 
support of the truth of religion, and relapsed into their 
ordinary utter indiiTerence to both. 

The reviewer, however, continues in a subsequent pas- 
sage : — ^ The question, indeed, lies within a narrow com- 
pass. The truths of religion and science can never be at 
variance. A geological truth must command our assent as 
powerfully as that of the existence of our own mindsi or of 
the Deity himsdf ; and any revelatioii whidi stands oppoaed

to such truths must be false. The geologist has, theiefore, 
nothing to do with revealed religion in his scientific inquiriea. 
It is the office of the divine to interpret the Sacred CanoD ; 
and if he does this with the discrimination and learning it 
demands, he will never find it at variance with the deductioiis 
of science. If Scripture^ on the contrary, be studied bjr 
instalments, and viewed from insulated points, and interpreted 
literally in its detached passages, we shall find it at variance 
with itself, and shall reproduce all the heresies which have 
disgraced the history of the Christian Church. But if we 
look at the sacred scheme as a whole, and genoaliie its 
individual proportions, we shall find in it a unity of do^ 
trine,^ be. 

In the general excellence of these remarks I fully aoqineaoe. 
The observation in the first sentence is undeniable; — truth 
cannot be contrary to itself; 1 would merely notice that this 
seems a singular reason why the geologist should ^ therejar^ 
have nothing to do with revealed truth ^ in his researches. 
That he lias not is very true ; not for this reason^ but on 
account of the essential independence of scientific inquiry 
into the works of God, as I have before explained. 

But further, it is worthy of notice with how much skill 
the precise point of the contradiction is eluded under the 
eloquent and undeniable generalities by which the respon- 
sibility is shifted on to the shoulders of the divine. His 
business it is to interpret Scripture; which, when rightly 
understood, will never be found at variance with geology: 
— And why? Because when comprehensively studied it 
furnishes a unity of doctrine, a spiritual law, be, all 
which great objects of revelation the writer proceeds to dilate 
upon in the powerful language of just encomium through 
the remainder of the paragraph. 

In a general sense nothing can be more just than the 
remarks here made on the principles of Scripture interprs-

UtioD ; yet this appears to me not a little at Tarianoe with 
the literal philology before recommended. 

In a more particular sense, however, I cannot but regard 
the indiscriminate adoption of this ^generalizing^ system, 
by which all the different parts of the Sacred Records are 
amalgamated into one, and the distinction of their separate 
applications lost siglit of, as the very source of the difficulty 
and objection felt on the ground of the geological discre^ 
pancieSb 

There is no doubt a plausibility in the vague assertion 
that geological conclusions cannot really come into coUifion 
with religious truths : — but the facts show that in the present 
instance there u such a collision ; — since the literal history 
of the creation involves the prinueval institution of the 
Sabbath ; a collision which no philology can prevent, no 
generalities disguise ; — but it can become an cbjection only 
from the prevalence of that system which mixes up Chris- 
tianity with older dispensations^

OV THE GEOLOGICAL ETIDEKCE OP FOEMEE COMDITIOVt 
OF OEGANIZEO LIFE, AKO ITS milEOSElf 

SUCCESSIOX. 



Ik Gorroboratiou of my remarks oo the unbroken series of 
changes by which the existing order of things on the globe 
has been introduced, I have peculiar satisfaction in being 
permitted to present my readers with the followiug extract 
from a letter with which I have been favoured by Peofessoe 
Phillips, of King*8 College, London:— 

^ The origin of organic life upon the globe, it may, 
perhsps, be impossible for geologists to fix, either with 
reference to the successive times disclosed by the examinatioQ 
of the earth'^s crust, or the geographical poritian ; but it is 
certain that in descending the series of strata, i. e^ in 
ascending the stream of time, we arrive at epochs continually 
less and less fertile of animal life, and finally readi a ter- 
minus of this life, as judged of by the organic remains in 
the rocks, before attaining the limit of gedogical time, 
estimated in terms of the thickness and nature of stratified 
deposits. This is the true geological definition of the origin 
of organic Kfe on the globe. 

*' If it should be asked, as is natural, were there any 
previous systems of life oo the globe? I reply, this is a 
matter to be considered on the evidence ccdkcted by geolo- 
gists as to the physical conditions under which the 
strata of the globe were deposited in the primseval 
Perhaps the balance of evidence, including of course that 
derived from general physical ooosidenitioasi is in favoilr of 



310 NOTEB. 

the hypothesis that the globe was in a state unfavourable to 
the devdopment of organic life by reason of the greater 
influence then exercised by its proper heat upon the pheno- 
mena at the surface, than after a considerable thickness of 
non-conducting materials (the earlier strata,) had become 
effectual in retarding the flow of heat from within. At all 
events, /or u«, reasoning from facts observed, the origin of 
tmr system of organic life is to be placed in the midst of 
the period of primary strata. 

*' The earliest forms of life known to geology are not, as 
might perhaps be expected, plants, but animals ; they arc 
not of the lowest grade of wganization merely ; zoophyta 
far advanced in structure^ (lamelliferous corals) ; brachio- 
podous bivalves, of three genera, were found by mysdf on 
Snowdon, but no distinct traces of plants. Thentfiiifier 
of species of this early fSuina is extremdy small, but there 
is about them no mark of inferiority, — no extraordinary 
simplicity. 

'* From this origin of organic life there is no break in the 
vast chain of organic development till we reach the existing 
order of things : no one geological period, long or short, 
no one series of stratified rocks, is everywhere devoid of 
traces of life; the world once inhabited has apparently never 
for any ascertainable period, been totally despoiled of its 
living wonders; but there have been many changes in the 
individual forms, great alterations in the generic assem- 
blages, entire revolutions in the relative number and deve> 
lopment of the several classes. Thus the systems of life 
have been varied from time to time to suit the altered 
oonditioD of thefdanet, but never extinguished; the earth 
once freed from its early inadequacy to support life aooord* 
ing to the afyointed laws of life, has since been prolific of 
vcsetable and ft***"'*^ ^ cxistcnoeL

even graduaUy (see my Guide to Geology^ mugmenting from 
the dozen species of the Snowdon dates, through the twelire 
hundred and more species of the oolite^ the four fhonnami 
forms of the tertiary eras, to the multitudes of existing 
things. The chafige of organic structure is ako^ in some 
d^iee, proportioned to the time dapsed; tried by the 
cephalopodous mollusca, we see perish first the orthooeratitesy 
then the Belemnites and Ammonites, while nautilus and 
sepia exbt to represent tliis class in existing nature. The 
development of the different classes of animals is usually 
thought to exhibit a similar reUtioo, as if nature had been 
continually improved from the moment of the origin of Ufe ; 
but this opinion is, if taken generally, one of the least certain 
of all the general notions now current, because of a radical 
defect in the reasoning. This defect consists in assuming 
into one induction the terrestrial and marine races of aninuds. 
Now, as the higher forms of life are terrestrial^ and the 
remains of terrestrial things are only by accident mixed 
with the spoils of the sea, it is no wonder that mammalia 
and birds are rarely suspected even to occur among the 
buried spoils of the ocean. However, the Diddphis of 
Stonesfield is enough to cast a doubt on this notion, whidi 
should be more critically examined by a logical process. It 
should be inquired what is the order of devdopment among 
the marine races on one hand, and the terrestrial groups oq 
the other. The latter are too few, in a fossil stat^ to justify 
any dedsion; the former supply certain evidence. The 
order of development is, zoophyta and brachiopodous coo- 
chifera; the same groups, with the addition of plagimyooooa 
conchifera, gasteropoda, cephalopoda, fishes; die same^ with 
the addition of reptiles ; the same, with one solitary didd- 
phis ; the same, without didelphis or any other quadruped ; 
the same, with marine and terrestrial quadrupeds; cxistinf

'^ l8 the present creation of life a continuadon of the 
previous ones, — a term of the same long series of oommu* 
nicated being? — I answer. Yes ! But not as the offspring 
is a continuation of its parent The present crocodiles are 
not thus derived from the Teleosaurus of Caen, by indefinite 
change through time and circumstance, as St Hilaire^s and 
Lamarck's, (and Goethe^s?) speculations might lead to 
suppose ; but the existing forms of life resemble those of 
times gone by, because the general aspect of the physical 
conditions of the world has always been, since the origin <^ 
life on the globe, decidedly analogous, and they differ from 
them because the co-relation of life and physical conditions 
is strict and necessary, so that all the variations of these 
conditions are represented in the phases of organic structure, 
while all their general agreements arc also represented by 
the conformity of the great principles of structure in the 
beings of every geological age, and the often repeated 
analogies and parallelisms of series of forms, between diffe- 
rent geological periods, which we now hail as a law of 
nature, when comparing America or Australia with Africa, 
Asia, or Europe. 

** We are not, then, in a different system of nature, pro- 
perly so called, from those which have been created and have 
been suffered to pass away before the birth of man ! but in a 
forward part of the same system, whose law of progressioo 
is fixed, though from time to time the signification of the 
terms varies. The full and complete system ol organic 
life now on the globe includes all the effects of land and 
warmth and cold, dinded regions, and all the other 
which are the diversifying causes of nature ; and it is no 
wonder if before tliis land was raised from the deep, and the 
present distinction of natural regions was produced, then 
was not the same extreme variety ot natural producCionSb

among the other uses and co-rdations of the visible creatioQ 
this is one ; by its inexhaustible diversity and ever-growinj^ 
newness to interest with a perpetual diarm the growing 
mind of a rational being, and lead him by a flowery path to 
the full cultivation of the divine thing within him, whidi 
raises him above all that his senses make known, and thus 
to fit him for the highest contemplatioo of which he is 
capable, vix^ the relation which he bears to the unseen 
Author of all this visible material world. 

*^ Thus, to the mind of a geologist nature is one glorious 
book ; one system of appointed and associated law, inde> 
pendent of time and exempt from change, but operating 
under conditions which vary with time and place; the past 
has prepared the present, the present explains the past and 
pomts to the future.^
