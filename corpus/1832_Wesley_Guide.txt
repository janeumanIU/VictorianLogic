introduction 



the object of the compiler in arranging these pages 
ia to lead the student by the shortest path to an acquain 
tance with the more interesting and practical parts of 
logic it appears to him that there are many persons 
who would decline the perusal of a treatise on apprehen 
sion the divisions of nouns and the different sorts of 
predicables who might be interested in examining the 
nature of propositions and the principle on which an 
inference is conclusively drawn 

he is confirmed in this opinion by having often ob 
served that youths of an ingenious and intellectual turn 
disinclined as they might be to undertake the perusal of 
a bulky volume upon logic are generally gratified when 
an argument is set before them in the brief and lucid foim 
of a syllogism 



xiv 

to the improvement of such youths he is induced to 
hope that the following pages aie judiciously adapted 
nor let it be urged that the study is too difficult if a lad 
is thought competent to understand cicero and to enter 
on the study of the higher classics he may surely be 
taught the method of airanging his conceptions in con 
foimity with logical precepts it may safely be affirmed 
that the more he is accustomed to the wholesome disci 
pline of so marshalling his thoughts the less likely will 
he be to fall into the errors of a hasty and defective judg 
ment he will see more readily what bears upon the 
question and in hb attempts at argument be less liable 
to encumber himself with unnecessary or irrelevant as 
sumptions the instrument he is furnished with though 
it cannot impait strength will yet in effect augment the 
natural powers as the poet represents the sharpness of 
the hatchet increasing the vigour of the woodman

the work will be completed in fewer strokes with less 
labour and greater accuracy 



xv 

the short sections which constitute the bulk of this 
manual comprise all that is necessary to a knowledge of 
syllogism or indeed of any form of argument recognized 
by logic such students as may desire a further insight 
into the subject will find incorporated with the index at 
the end what in most books on logic is placed at the 
commencement 

many technical terms that are in frequent use though 
not employed in the following treatise will be found with 
their explanations in the index 

it has been the aim of the compiler to render each sec 
tion as short as perspicuity would allow that the instruc 
tor might be furnished with suitable portions for exercis 
ing the memory of junior pupils 

a few examples for practice have been added and re 
ferences to the rules and sections are subjoined for the 
further assistance of the learner 



xvi 

the appendix contains a summaiy account of the 
manner of syllogizing in the schools at cambridge and 
it is hoped that younger disputants who are about to ap 
pear there may derive some advantage from the following 
pages 

to the regii professors in divinity law and physic 
and to the rev dr grftham master of christs college 
cambridge the compiler has to offer his most grateful 
thanks for the numerous obligations under which they 
have laid him 

he has the honour also to confess himself indebted to 
the learned and accomplished author of the elements 
of logic not only for the advantage of his published 
writings but for many acts of private courtesy

jrc jrc 



of reasoning and syllogism 

 an act of reasoning is performed by compar 
ing two ideas together by means of a thirds that 
must agree with one of them if this third idea 
agrees with the other two those two of course 
aree with one another if it agrees with only one 
they of course disagree with one another 

 a syllogism from nxkoyliofuuf to reason 
is an argument stated at full length and in regular 
logical form 

 by an arguments being stated at full length 
is meant that the apphcation of the third idea to 



 £ in reasoning on the character of caesar if i wished 
to ascertain whether the idea of a good man agreed with 
him i might take for a third idea that of tyrant on 
finding this agree with caesar and disagree with good 
man i should say that the ideas of caesar and good man 
disagreed with one another or in other words that cae 
sar was not a good man the third idea thus employed 
to assist us in forming a judgment is called a middle term 

b 






 of reasonina and syllogism 

the two others is expressed in terms and that how 
ever ohvious the application may he in the case of 
one of thejn it is never on that account taken for 
granted 

 by an arguments being stated in regular logi 
cal form is meant its being so arranged that the 
conclusiveness of it is manifest from the mere force 
of the expression i e without considering the 
meaning of the terms thus 

eveiy y is x 
every z is y therefore 
every z is x 
if you grant the two former assertions or premises 
you cannot deny the conclusion 

 syllogisms are divided into categorical from 
karriyopib i affirm and hjrpothetical from vv 
etriq a supposition categorical syllogisms are 
divided into pure and modal hypothetical syllo 
gisms into conditional and disjunctive syllogisms 
take their names from the different kinds of propo 
sitions employed in forming them 

of propositionfif 

 a proposition is a sentence that affirms or 
denies it consists of three parts viz the subject 



 to 

 c 



of propositions 

or thing spoken of the predicate or that which is 
said of it and the copula which must he the suh 
stantive verh with or without a negative particle as 
the suhject and predicate happen to agree or dis 
agree 

 the subject and predicate are called terms or 
extremes because according to logical order the 
subject is placed first the predicate last and the 
copula in the middle 

sutj cop pred 

ex — i vice i i is i i detestable i 

svibj cop pred 



i virtue i i is not i i unrewarded • 
 the substantive verb alone is recognized by 
logic all other verbs are resolvable into the sub 
stantive verb with a participle or adjective 
ex — the summer approaches 

suifj cop pred 



i the summer i i is i • approaching i 
he does not know it 

suijj cop pred 



i he i i is not i i aware of it i 
 as the copula is used merely to express the 
agreement or disagieement of the terms it is or 

• in speaking of a syllogism the term extremes is 
often understood to imply the extremes of the conclusion 

b 



 of propositions 

may be always put in the present tense shoukl 
the tense of the substantive verb modify the sense of 
the proposition this circumstance must be viewed 
as part of one of the terms 

ex — troy is existent 

troy was existent i — 

su cop fred 

i troy i i is i i a place that was formerly existent i 
 an adjective or participle though it cannot 
be the subject may yet be the predicate of a pro 
position but even then a substantive appears to 
be understood as life is short art is long 
in these two propositions the word thing may 
be supplied to each predicate — see syncatego 
r£m atic word in the index 



 the variety of expression allowable in language will 
often occasion a proposition to appear in a fonn very dif 
ferent from that recognized by logic to that form how 
ever all propositions are reducible and the pupil should 
be accustomed to bring into it with readiness propositions 
of a dissimilar construction £ o 

 of his kingdom there shall be no end 
 an end of his kingdan is that which shall not be 
 in loftiness of thought homer surpasses virgil 
 homer is a poet who surpasses virgil in loftiness of 
thought 
 it is the duty of youth to reverence age 
 to reverence age is the duty of youtii 



division of propositions 

 propositions are either categorical and sub 
divided into pure andmodal or hypothetical and 
subdivided into conditional and disjunctive this 
division is according to substance they are either 
affirmative or negative this division is accord 
ing to qttality u e the quality of the expression 
they are universal or particular this division 
is according to quantity 

 a pure proposition is sometimes called propositio de 
inesse because it simplj states that the predicate is or is 
not metaphysically in the subject 

f another division of propositions is into singular and 
indefinite a singular proposition is one of which the sub 
ject is an individual either a proper name a singular pro 
noun or a common noun with a singular sign £ g cae 
sar overcame pompey i am the person this fable is 
instructive but as these propositions predicate of the 
whole of the subject they fall under the rules that govern 
universals it is to be observed that if the subject of a 
proposition consist of a number of nouns couedively under 
stood so that they are viewed as one single thing or body 
the proposition is singular £ all the books in pto 
lemys library amounted to volumes i e all to 
together two and two make four caesar pompey 
and crassus constituted the first triumvirate when the 
word together can be added to the subject of the proposition 
or when the word each cannot be introduced that proposi 
tion is singular 

an indefinite proposition is one that has no sign of uni 
versality or particularity affixed to it but leaves us to 



 division of propositions 

 a categorical proposition declares a thing 
icariyyopcl absolutely as i love or i am lov 
ing man is not infallible these are pure ca 
tegoricals asserting simply the agreement and dis 
agreement of subject and predicate the wisest 
man may possibly be mistaken a prejudiced 
historian will probably misrepresent the truth 
these are mofa categoricals asserting the manner 
of the agreement and disagreement between subject 
and predicate 

 a hypothetical proposition consists of two 
or more categoricals united by a conjunction called 
the copula it asserts not absolutely but under 
an hypothesis or condition such propositions are 
denoted by the conjunctions used in stating them 
e g if man is fallible he is imperfect this 

judge from the nature of the connexion between the terms 
or extremes no whether it should be reckoned as uni 
versal or particular see no 

 the modality of a proposition is usually considered to 
affect the copula logical writers have selected as most 
worthy of remark four modes of connexion between subject 
and predicate — viz necessary possible impossible and 
contingent e g man is necessarily an animal a 
globe may possibly consist of water it is impossible a 
man should be a stone john may or may not be 
learned 



division of propositions 

is called a conditional proposition denoted by the 
conjunction if it is either day or night 
this is a disjunctive hypothetical and is denoted 
by the disjunctive conjunction either 

 an affirmative proposition is one of which the 
copula no is affirmative negative propo 
sition is one of whidi the copula is negative there 
is an example of each in no 

 a universal proposition is one of which the 
predicate is affirmed or denied of the whole of the 
sdbject its usual signs are all every none 
c or a universal proposition may have for its 
subject a proper name or a common name with a 
singular sign — see note to no e g all 
tyrants are miserable no miser is rich eng 
land is an island — a particular proposition is one 
of which the piedicate is affirmed or denied of only 
part of the subject its usual signs are some 

¦ ¦¦i i m m i i i ¦ ii — ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦ i — ¦¦¦—¦ — —¦¦¦ ii ¦ 

 to the signs of udiversality might be added who 
ever each neither always every where c 
to tiiose of particularity a few not every some 
times somewhere c there are some particular signs 
which make a near approach to a universal affirmative as 
 many very many almost all by far the greater 
part c some on the other hand come very near to a 
universal negative as few very few scarcely any 
c 



 distribution of terms etc 

 many few several most and all or 
 every if the copula be negative eg some 
islands are fertile many worthy men have to 
complain of ill fortune most men are fond of 
novelty all tyrants or some trrants are not 
assasnated none but means some and 
those only or one person thing or object and 
that only it is therefe the sign of a particular 
or a singular proposition 

distribution of terms symbols of quantity 

and quality etc 

 in all universal propositions the subject is 
distributed an expression which signifies that a 
term is used in its fullest extent tha it stands for 
all its significates or the several things which it sig 
nifi so that there is not an individual to which 
the common term is applicable that it does not em 
brace as in the example all tyrants are mi 
serable the common term includes dionysius 
phraates nero and every individual who is a ty 
rant in all particular propositions the subject is 
undistributed it stands for only part of its signifi 
cates and the common term then embraces only a 
part of the individuals to which it is applicable — 



distribution of terms etc 

as in the example some islands are fertile the 
common term island though applicahle to ice 
land and all harren islands does not emhrace them 

 there are four kinds of pure categorical pro 
positions distinguished by the symbols a e i o 

universal affirmative a 
universal negative e 
particular affirmative i 
particular negative o 

 the connexion between the extremes of a 
proposition is necessary impossible or contingent 

 to determine whether an indefinite propo 
sition should be viewed as particular or universal 
we must look to the connexion between the ex 
tremes i e we must consider of the subject and 
predicate whether they necessarily agree or ne 
cessarily disagree or may or may not agree the 
nature of the connexion between the extremes is 
called the matter of the proposition in necessary 
and in impossible matter an indefinite is understood 
as a universal as birds have wings i e all 
 birds are not quadrupeds i e none in con 
tingent matter i e where the terms sometimes 
agree and sometimes not an indefinite is under 
stood as a particular as food is necessary to 



 distribution of terms etc 

life t e some kind of food birds sing i e 
some birds sing birds are not carnivorous i e 
some birds are not or all are not 

 the rules for distribution are these — 
 st all universal propositions and no particular 
distribute the subject 

nd all negative and no affirmative the predi 
cate f 

 the learner should observe that the term in question is 
 a thing necessatyto life and not conclude from the 
word necessary that the connexion between the terms 
 food and necessary to life is a necessary connexion 
it is contingent because it happens that there are kinds of 
food which are not necessary to life as ft happens that 
there are birds which do not sing and birds which are car 
nivorous whereas it cannot happen that any creature 
without wings or that any quadruped should be a bird 
it is necessary that a creature should have wings to con 
stitute it a bird and impossible for a quadruped to be 
one 

f thus the distribution or nondistribution of the subject 
of every proposition depends on its quantity the distribu 
tion or nondistribution of the predicate on its quality 
and note further that if in an affirmative proposition the 
whole of the predicate should agree with the subject the cir 
eumstance is achdefual and not implied in the form of ex 
pression in the propositions all men are rational ani 
mals and all men are animals the form of expression 
is the same but in the one instance it so happens that 
tfae whole of tfae predicate agrees with the subject which is 



of the opposition of propositions 

 two propositions are said to be opposed 
when having the same subject and predicate they 
yet differ in quantity or quality or both see 
nos the use of the rules of opposi 
tion is that they immediately point out what we 
may infer with regard to the tnith or falsity of any 
other proposition which has the same subject and 
predicate as the proposition before us but differs 
from it either in quantity or quality or both 

 there are four different kinds of opposition 
— st between the two universals a and e differ 
ing in quality only and called contraries nd 
between the two particulars i and o differing also in 
quality only and called suhcontraries rd be 
tween a and i or e and o differing respectively 
in quantity only and called subalterns th be 
tween a and o or e and i differing respectively 
both in quantity and quality and called contradic 
tories 

not the case in the other all rational animals are men 
but all animals are not men in a just definition the 
terms are always exactly equivalent and therefore conver 
tude 

 four things are requisite to form a just contradiction 
— viz that we speak of the same thing st in the same 
sense nd as to the same part rd compared with the

 of the opposition of propositions 

 the signs no and none imply both 
universality and negation they are contradictory 
therefore to the particular sign with an affirmative 
copula we cannot contradict some are by 
 all are not e g some monarchs are ty 
rants all monarchs are not tyrants — which are 
subcontrary propositions perfectly compatible and 
both particular 

 of subaltern propositions the universal is 
called subaltemans the particular subaltemate 

 in necessary matter all affirmatives are 
true as all islands are surrounded by water 
 some islands are surrounded by water 
and negatives false as no islands are sur 
rounded by water some islands aie not sur 
rounded by water in impossible matter all ne 
gatives are tnte as no triangles are squares 

same thing th existing at the same time by omitting 
one of these conditions is and is not may be compatible 
£ g the carcass of a man is and is not a man for it is 
a dead man t is not a living one nd zoilus is and is

• the truth or falsity of propositions is here seen to de 
pend on the matter see no propositions may he 



conversion of propositions 

 in subalterns the truth of the particular or 
subaltemate follows from the truth of the 
universal or subalternans and the falsity 
of the universal from the falsity of the particular 
the opposition between contiadictories is so perfect 
since they differ both in quantity and quality see 
no that if any proposition is true we may be 
sure its contradictory is false if false its contradic 
tory true c 

conversion of propositions 

 a proposition is said to be converted when 
the subject and predicate are made to exchange 
places as no triangles aie squares no squares 
are triangles the use of conversion is to give a 
ready insight into what may be inferred from an 
other proposition that differs from the one before 
us by the terms being transposed this change in 
the position of the teims may be combined with 
that of the quantity or quality or both or neither 

framed in a e i o on the following subjects and adapted 
to the scheme by way of exemplification 

n that islands should be surrounded by water 

i that triangles should be squares 

c that islands are feitile 
 if au islands are surrounded by water it is plain that 
some must be so if that any one triangle is a square be 
false it mutt be false to say that all are so 



 gontersion of propomtlolvs 

as the ase may be by conversion a facility is 
likewise afforded in effecting the reduction of syllo 
gisms a process that will presently be explained 

 the above is an instance of simple convei 
sion the subject and predicate being merely trans 
posed but as this can be done only when the 
terms of a proposition are of exactly the same ex 
tent two other methods are in use which enable 
us to convert consistently with truth eveiy propo 
sition whatever — viz st the limitation of the pre 
dicate of the exposita or proposition given from 
universal to paiticnlar which is called conversion 
per accidens or by limitation and ndly the add 
ing not to the predicate of theexposita and then 
denying its agreement with the subject which is 
called conversion by negation or oontraposition 
but in the case of o the particular native con 
version by negation is effected by joining the nega 
tive paiticle of the copula to the predicate of the 
exposita and then transposing the terms as if the 
proposition had been i 

 no conversion is employed for any logical 
purpose unless it be illative l e when the truth 
of the converse is implied by the truth of the ex 
posita no 

 conversion is then only illative when no 



conversion of propositions 

term is distributed in the converse which was not 
distributed in the exposita else you would em 
ploy a term universally in the converse which in 
the exposita was used only partially for dis 
tiihuted see no 

 the following examples will shew how every 
proposition a e i o may be illatively con 
verted by some one of the three methods above 
mentioned — viz st simply nd per accidens 
or by limitation rd by negation or contraposi 
tion e i simply for e distributes both terms 
no and i neither no they 
are therefore of exactly the same extent no 
and simply convertible 

e no triangles aie squares therefore 
no squares are tiiangles 

i some islands are fertile places therefore 
some fertile places are islands 

e a per accidens or by limitation e because 
the predicate being distributed as well as the sub 
ject and admitting therefore of the sign of uni 
versality as is shewn by simple conversion it 
must as a universal include the particular 

e no triangles are squares therefore — 
some squares are not triangles 



 conversion of propositions 

which follows from the truth of the simple conr 
verse a is converted per accidens or by limi 
tation because since it does not distribute the pre 
dicate no that predicate will not admit of a 
universal sign and therefore requires a particular 
one 

a all birds are animals therefore 
some animals are birds 
you could not say all animals are birds 

a o by negation a because the subject 
agrees universally with the predicate so that what 
disagrees with the predicate cannot agiee with the 
subject 

a all birds are animals therefore 
what are not animals are not birds 
o because since you consider it as i neither term 
is distributed and the process is that of simple 
conversion 

cop 

o some islands lare not fertile places first 
state this as i by joining the negative to the pre 

 it is the same thing to affirm some attribute of the sub 
ject and to deny the absence of it thus a all birds are 
animals is equipollent to e no birds are notanimals 
which is of course simply convertible what are not 
animals are not birds 



conversion of propositions 

fred 



dlcatethus some islands are i notfertileplaces 
theiefore — 

some placesnotfertile are islands 

you could not infer from the exposita some 
islands are not fertile places that some fertile 
places are not islands such a converse indeed 
would accidentally be true but it would not follow 
from the form of expression this will be seen by 
substituting other terms e g 

some men are not i poets you cannot infer 
 some poets are not men but you may infer — 
some who are not poets are men 

 to assist the memory in applying the two 
former methods of conversion viz simple and per 
acddens aldrich who does not notice conversion 

by negation gives the following mnemonic line 

f£cl simpliciter convertitur eva per acci 
for the last we may say 

a sed et o pariter convertas usque negando 

or 

faxo per contra sic fit conversio tota 
of syllogisms 

 the validity of a syllogism depends on this 
axiom of aristotle whatever is predicated of z 

c 



 of syllogisms 

term distributed no whether affirmatively 
or negatively may be predicated in like manner of 
every thing contained under it in the example 
at no x is predicated of y distributed and z 
is contained under y i e is its subject x is 
therefore truly predicated of z 

 there are two canons of pure categorical 
syllogisms st two terms that agree with one and 
the same third agree vnth each other nd two 
terms of which one agrees and another disagrees 
with one and the same third disagree with one an 
other on the former of these canons rests the va 
lidity of affirmative conclusions on the latter of 
negative 

 there are six rules for ascertaining whether 
the canons have been strictly observed or not 

rule st every syllogism has three and only 
three terms viz the middle term and the two 
terms of the conclusion or question the sub 
ject of the conclusion is called the minor termf 
its predicate the major term and the middle 

 these are commonly called extremes 

f because generally of less eiitent than the msyor and 
middle terms 



of syllogisms 

term is that with which each of them is separately 
compared in order to judge of their agreement or 
disagieement with each other 

rule nd every syllogism has three and only 
three propositions viz the major premiss in 
which the major term is compared with the middle 
the minor premiss in which the minor term is com 
pared with the middle and the conclusion in 
which the minor term is compared with the major 

rule drd the middle term must not he amhi 
guous which is the case whenever it is equivocal 
or undistributed an equivocal term is used in 
different senses in the two premises eg 
 sage is a plant 

a philosopher is sage therefore 
a philosopher is a plant 

if a term he undistrihuted as it then stands for 
a part only of its significates it may happen that 
one of the extremes may have heen compared with 
one part of it and the other with another part eg 



 if there were two middle terms the extremes not being 
both compared with the same could not be conclusively 
compared with each other 

f if the middle term is ambiguous there are in reality 
two middle terms in sense though but one in sound 



 of jsyllogism 

 apples are fruit 

cherries are fruit therefore 
cherries are apples 

the middle term therefore must he distributed 
once at least in the premises i e by being the 
subject of a universal or predicate of a negative 

rule th no term must be distributed in the 
conclusion which was not distributed in one of 
the premises because you would then employ the 
whole of a term in the conclusion when you had 
employed only a part of it in the premiss and 
thus in reality introduce a fourth term the vio 
lation of this fourth rule is called an illicit process 
of the major or minor term e g 

 all apples are fruit 

cherries are not apples therefore 

they are not fruit illicit process of the major 

all beasts of prey are carnivorous 

fall beasts of prey are animals therefore 

all animals are carnivorous illicit process of the 

minor 



 this is a and no armatives distribute the predicate 
the conclusion is £ and all negatives do distribute the 
predicate no 

f this also is a and does not distribute the predicate 



of syllogisms 

ride th from negative premises you can infer 
nothing for in them the middle term is pro 
nounced to disagree with both extremes not to 
agree with both or to agree with one and disagree 
with the other therefore they cannot be compared 
together eg 

 a fish is not a quadruped 

 a bird is not a quadruped proves nothing 

rule th if one premiss he negative the con 
elusion must be negative for in that premiss the 
middle term is pronounced to disagree with one of 
the extremes and in the other premiss which 
must be affirmative by the preceding rule to agree 
with the other extreme therefore the extremes 
disagreeing with each other the conclusion is nega 
tive to prove a negative conclusion one of the 
premises must be negative f 



 animals the conclusion again is a and does distribute 
ihe subject y animals 

• in order to shew the disagreement between the terms 
 fish and bird you must choose a middle term that 
agrees with one of them e g a feathered creature is 
not a fish a bird is a feathered creature therefore c 
or no animal that inhabits the water is a bird a fish is 
an animal that inhabitb the water therefore c 

f to prove that the sun is not a planet you must not 



 of syllogisms 

 from these rules it is evident first that 
nothing can he proved from two particular pre 
mises and secondlyf that if one of the premises 
he particular the conclusion must he particular 



take for a middle term sphere which agrees with both 
but a middle term that disagrees either with sun or 
 planet e g every planet describes an orbit j the 
sun does not describe an orbit therefore it is not a planet 
or the sun is a fixed star a planet is not a fixed star 
therefore it is not the sun 

• you will then have either the middle term undistri 
buted or an illicit process e g some animals are sa 
gacious some beasts are sagacious therefore some beasts 
are animals undistributed middle this conclusion is 
true but does not follow from the premises the argument 
is of the same construction as the following absurdity 
 some animals are black some hats are black therefore 
some hats are animals again some animals are saga 
cious some beasts are not sagacious therefore some 
beasts are not animals here is an illicit process of the 
major some carnivorous creatures are tame some beasts 
are not tame therefore no beasts are carnivorous crea 
tures this exhibits an illicit process of both the major 
and minor term 

f e g all who fight bravely deserve reward some 
soldiers fight bravely therefore some soldiers deserve re 
ward if you were to infer all soldiers deserve c 
there would be an illicit process of the minor 

x the following mnemonic lines from aldrich may as 
sist the student in applying these rules and remarks 



of syllogisms 

 from universal premises you cannot always 
infer a universal conclusion e g all gold is 
precious all gold is a mineral therefore some 
mineral is precious but when you can infer a 
universal you are always at liberty to infer a par 
ticular 

of moods 

 the mood of a syllogism is the designation 
of it according to the quantity no and qua 
lity no ii of each of its three propositions 
which are denoted by the vowels a e i o no 
 there are only eleven moods admissible as 
conforming to the rules laid down at no see 
no below 

of figures 

 the figure of a syllogism indicates the situ 

l 

distribuas medium rule nee quartus terminus adsit 
rule 

utraque nee praemissa negans rule nee particularis 
no 
sectetur partem conclusio deteriorem rule no 
£t non distribuat nisi cum praemissa negetve rule 
logicians have attached to universal propositions an 
imaginary superiority over particulars and to affirmatives 
a similar superiority over negatives hence the expression 
 pars deterior meaning a particular or a negative propo 
sition 



 of syllogisms 

ation of the middle term with regard to the ex 
tremes of the conclusion or major and minor term 
no rule and note there are four fi 
gures in the first the middle term is made the 
subject of the major premiss and the predicate of 
the minor in the second the middle term is the 
predicate of both premises in the third the sub 
ject of hoth in the fourth it is the predicate of 
the major premiss and the subject of the minor 

 the major premiss of a syllogism is usually 
pl£ued first although of course the validity of the 
argument is not affected by the order of the two 
premises 

 each of the moods alluded to in no as 
admissible will not be so in every figure since 
from the different position of the middle term it 
may violate some of the foregoing rules in one 
figure though not in another f 



 the first figure is the most natural and clear and is at 
once open to the application of aristotles dictum no 
the last is in all respects the very reverse of the first 

f i a i for instance is allowable in the third figure 
because in that figure the middle term is made the subject 
of both the major and minor premiss no it is there 
fore regularly distributed in the minor proposition a no 
 and as neither term is distributed in the conclusion h 



of syllogisms 

 although but eleven moods were stated to 
be admissible at no yet since some of them 
occur in more than one figure as e i o which 

no there can be no illicit process no but 
i a i is iaadmissible in the first figure because that figure 
demands that the middle term be made the subject of 
the major proposition i and the predicate of the minor 
a but i distributes neither term and a only the subject 
no the middle term therefore being the subject of 
a particular and the predicate of an affirmative would be 
undistributed contrary to rule and no valid conclusion 
could follow e g 

i some arrogant men are learned 

a all arrogant men are disagreeable therefore 

i some learned men are disagreeable 

the above is in the third figure and valid in the first 
figure the same mood would be inadmissible for the rea 
sons above stated e g 

i some learned men are englishmen 

a the sages of greece were learned men j therefore 

i some of them were englishmen 

so a e e would in the first figure have an illicit pro 
cess of the major thus 

a every fool is a sensualist 

e no true philosopher is a fool therefore 

e no true philosopher is a sensualist 

the major term sensualist is not distributed in the 
major proposition but is in the conclusion the same 
mood in the second figure is valid because the major term 
 sensualist is regularly distributed in the major proposi 
tion £ g 



 of syllogisms 

is found in all the four eaxh separate occurrence 
is reckoned as a new mood from this recunence 
of the same symbols in different figures there are 
reckoned nineteen moods 



a every sensualist is a fool 

£ no true philosopher is a fool therefore 

£ no true philosopher is a sensualist 

again a a a is allowable in the first figure 

a all wicked men are miserable 

a all tyrants are wicked men therefore 

a all tyrants are miserable 

but in the third figure it would have an illicit process 
of the minor 

a all wicked men are miserable 

a all wicked men are tyrants therefore 

a all tyrants are miserable 

the minor term tyrants is not distributed in the mi 
nor premiss but is in the conclusion

ter to avoid the fault of negative premises no rule 
or to produce an affirmative conclusion no rule 
the second figure proves only negatives because the middle 
term being the predicate in both premises would not be 
distributed unless one premiss were negative no rule 
 and therefore the conclusion must be negative no 
rule the third prove only particulars because the 
middle term being always the subject in the minor propo 
sition and that minor proposition being always affirmative 
the minor term as the predicate of an affirmative cannot 
be distributed in its premiss and therefore cannot be dis 
tributed in the conclusion

 the four moods of the first figure are called 
feci all the rest imperfect when a syllogism 
in one of the imperfect moods is restated and 
brought into the first figure it is said to be reduced 

ostensive reduction 

 in reducing a syllogism it is allowable to 
convert the premises illatively no or to 
transpose them this liberty renders it always 
possible to deduce in the first figure either the very 
same conclusion as the original one or another 
from which the original one is deducible by illative 
conversion 

 the method of statement in this figure is so clumsy 
fnd inverted that it is seldom or never used the propo

 reduction of syllogisms 

 a few examples of reduction may suffice 
camestres is reduced to celarent as the initial let 
ter directs by simply converting the minor as 
is denoted by the s in es and then transposing 
the premises as is indicated by the m in cam 
the conclusion of the reduced syllogism is the

rent whatever is truly satisfactory is not a guilty

 fakoro is reduced to ferio by converting 
the major by negation no and considering 

cessary to explain its object is to show that an absurdity 
would follow from supposing the original conclusion to be 
false when this mode of reduction is adopted fakoro 
and dokamo are called baroko and bokardo k being then 
the sign of the reductio ad impossibile but conversion 
by negation is by far the easier and more expeditious 
process

negative to the predicate instead of the copula

fakoro

ri some professors of religion are i notcharit 
able i therefore

 faluiro may be considered as festinoy and stated ac 
cordingly by placing an equipollent negative proposition 
for the major no note and viewing the minor as an 

aflslrmative 

suiject predicate 

fes i no sincere christian i is i notcharitable i 

predicate 

ti some professors of religion are i notcharitable i 

therefore 
no some professors of religion are not sincere christians 



 reduction of syllogisms 

the minor premiss is here considered affirma 
dve because you take notcharitable as the middle 
term and cannot separate the negative from it 
without introducing a fourth term contrary to no 
 rule 

 darapti is reduced to darii by converting 
per accidens no the minor premiss this 
is denoted by the p in rap no 

festino is reduced to ferio by simply converting the tnar 
jor he who is not charitable is not a sincere christian

accordingly by joining the negative to the predicate in

this conclusion is the converse by negation of 
the original one i e o converted into i and 
therefore simply convertible into it no 



 of modal syllogisms 

 those syllogisms are called modal that con 
sist of modal propositions no modal pro 
positions may be considered as pure categoricals 
and stated accordingly for this purpose you 
should attach the mode to one of the terms as 
 the wisest man may possibly be mistaken 

sul cop pred 

i the wisest man i i is i i one who may possibly 



be mistaken i it is probable that livy was 
prejudiced i e 

suij cop pred 

i livy i was i probably prejudiced i 

 when the mode expresses only the neces 
sary impossible or contingent connexion of the 
teims you may attach it to the subject as man 
is necessarily mortal i e all men are mortal 
 it is impossible for a bad man to be happy ie 
no bad man can be happy 

 it is often however most convenient to af 
firm simply the agreement or disagreement of the 
mode with the dictum or assertion itself as 
am possibly mistaken 

sukj cop pred 

i that i am mistaken i rttl possible 



of hypothetical syllogisms 

in these cases the subject implies that an entire 
act of judgment has previously taken place 

of hypothetical syllogisms 

 a syllogism is called hypothetical when 
it contains one two or three hypothetical pro 
positions e g if he is wise he is happy 
he is wise therefore he is happy or he who 
is wise is happy if he is a philosopher he is wise 
therefore if he is a philosopher he is happy or 
 if he is wise he is happy if he is a philosopher 
he is wise therefore if he is a philosopher he is 
happy see no the hrpothetical syllogisms 
most in use are divided into conditional and dis 
junctive e g 

conditional 

if man is fallible he is imperfect 
but he is fallible therefore 
he is imperfect 

disjunctive 

it is either day or night 
but it is day therefore 
it is not night 
 in a hypothetical syllogism the reasoning 



 of conditional syllogisms 

turns on the hypothesis and the conclusion is al 
ways categorical 

the hypothetical premiss is called the major 
and the categorical one the minor 

of conditional syllogisms 

 it is to be observed of a conditional propo 
sition that it contains two and only two categorical 
propositions whereofone results from the other that 
from which the other results is called the antecedent 
that which results from it the consequent canse 
quensj the connexion between the two ex 
pressed by if is called the consequence can 
sequentia 

consequentia antecedent cimtequent 

ilfl i man is fallible i he is imperfect 

 the truth or falsity of a conditional propo 
sition depends entirely on the conseqtience or con 



 when a hypothetical conclusion is drawn from a hypo 
thetical premiss the reasoning is in effect categorical eg 

predicate 

every conqueror is i either a hero or a villain f 

caesar was a conqueror therefore 

predicate 

he was i either a hero or a villain i 

 the antecedent is sometimes placed qfter the conse 
quent we might say man is imperfect if he is fallible 



of conditional syllogisms 

nexian between antecedent and consequent both 
antecedent and consequent may be false yet if 
there be such a connexion between them that the 
falsity of the antecedent depends on the falsity of 
the consequent the whole proposition is valid 
eg 

antecedent 



if i logic is useless 

consequent 

i it deserves to be neglected i 
on the other hand both antecedent and consequent 
may be true yet if there be no connexion between 
them so that the latter does not depend for its 
truth on the former the whole proposition h false 
i e the consequent does not follow from the ante 
cedent 

antecedent 



if i virgil was a poet i 

cormeqttent 



i he wrote the neid i 
it is true both that virgil was a poet and that he 

 if you deny the consequent logic deserves to be ne 
glected the falsity of the antecedent logic is useless 
must follow this will appear from a categorical statement 
of the proposition a whatever is useless is deserving 
of neglect convert this by negation e whatever 
is not deserving of neglect is not useless no logic 
is not deserving of neglect therefore it is not useless 



 of conditional syllogisms 

wiote the jcneid but it does not follow that becatise 
he was a poet he thereare wrote the jieneid 

 there are two rules for drawing a conclu 
sion fiom a conditional proposition rule te 
antecedent being granted the consequent may he 
inferred e g 

 if a is b c is d maj or if rain has fallen the 

ground is wet 
but a is b minor but rain has fallen 

therefore therefore 

c is d conclusion the ground is wet 

these syllogisms in which the antecedent is 
granted are called constructive 

rule the consequent being denied the ante 
cedent may be denied 
 if a is b c is d if rain has fallen the 

ground is wet 
but cisnotd therefore but the ground is not 

wet therefore 
a is not b rain has not fallen 

these syllogisms in which the consequent is denied 
are called destructive 

 by denying the antecedent or affirming the 
consequent nothing can be inferred because the 
same consequent may follow from other anteee 



of disjunctive syllogisms 

dents rain may not have fallen and yet the 
ground may be wet or fthe ground may be wet 
and yet no rain have fallen because dew or an 
inundation would produce the same effect 

of disjunctive syllogisms 

 to what has been said of a disjunctive pro 

 here the antecedent is denied 

f here the consequent is affirmed 

x conversion by negation no is applicable to condi

 of disjunctive syllogisms 

sition no must be added that it consists of 
two or more categoricals so stated as to imply that 
smne one of them at least is true and generally 
that but one can be true as it is either day or 
night 

 by denying one of the categoricals of a dis 
junctive proposition if there be but two you may 
infer the truth of the remaining one as it is 
either day or night but it is not day therefore 
it is night by denying one of them if there be 
several you may infer the truth of some one of the 
remaining oyies as it is either spring summer 
autumn or winter but it is not spring there 
fore it is either summer autumn or winter 
by denying all but one you will infer the truth of 
that one as it is neither spring summer nor 
autumn therefore it is winter 

 when it is implied that only one of the ca 
tegoricals can be true by affirming one you of 
course deny the rest as it is either spring 
summer c but it is spring therefore it is nei 
ther summer autumn nor winter 

 if both categoricals should be true it is plain that the 
affirmation of one cannot imply the denial of the other as 
amphibious creatures live either on land or in the water

the dilemma 

 the dilemma is a redundant conditional syl 
logism with two or more antecedents in the major 
premiss and a disjunctive minor 

 dilemmas are either constructiye or destruc 
tive of the constructive dilemma there are two 
sorts simple and complex there is but one sort 
of the true destructive dilemma 

 the simple constiuctive dilemma has but 
one cotisequent to each antecedent the antece 
dents being disjunctively granted in the minor the 

common consequent is inferred see no rule 

mqjor 

 if a is b c is d and if e is f c is d 

minor cktnchtsion 



t€ 



i but either a is b or e is f i i therefore c is d i 
if a christian be living he is the lords servant 
and if he be dead he is the lords servant but he 



 as in this kind of argument there are generally in 
the migor premiss two antecedents which in the minor 
become two assumptions it is termed a dilemma from uq 
tmccy twoy and xiififia an assumption it is called by the 
lexicographers syllogismus ab utrslque parte feriens ad 
versarium and argumentum comutum because most 
homed animals have two horns and there are in a dilemma 
itvo instrumetits of attack furnished in the two assumptions 
so cowlev both the horns of fates dilemma wound 



 the dilemma 

must be always either living or dead therefore he 
is always the lords servant see ramans xiv 
 

 the complex constructive dilemma has a 
difierent consequent to each antecedent the an 
tecedents are disjunctively granted in the minor 
and the different consequents disjunctively inferred 

eg lifaisbcisdandifeisfgishl 

minor can 

i but either a is b or e is f i i therefore either 

cltuion 

c is d or g is h i if the evangelists speak 
truth christianity is of god and if they do not 
speak truth the existence of christianity is per 
fectly unaccountable but the evangelists either 
do or do not speak truth therefore christianity is 
either of god or its existence is perfectly unac 
countable 

f the farue destructive dilemma has like the 

 the conditionals of the major premiss may be united 
by the adverb whether so as to form one proposition 
£ g whether a christian lives or dies he is the lords 
servant 

f there is a form of argument incorrectly styled a de 
structive dilemma in which the consequents are wholly 



the dilemma 

complex constructive a different consequent to each 
antecedent in the major the consequents are 
disjunctively denied in the minor and the ante 
cedents disjunctively denied in the conclusion 
eg if a isb c is d andif e is f gish 
but either c is not d or g is not h therefore 
either a is not b or e is not f — if a witness 
be an honest one he will not bear false testimony 

instead of disjunctively denied in the minor this is 
however a mere combination of simple conditional syllo • 
gisms two or more being expressed together it may con 
sist either — st of one antecedent with several consequents 
or ndl of several antecedents with one consequent or 
srdly of several antecedents with several consequents 
st if a is b c is d if a is b e is f if a is b g is h j 
but c is not d £ is not f g is not h therefore a is not 
b ndly if a is b c is d if e is f c is d if g is h 
c is d but c is not d therefore a is not b £ is not f 
g is not h rdly if a is b c is d if £ is f g is h 
if i is k l is m but c is not d g is not h l is not m 
therefore a is not b e is not f i is not k should you 
in the first case deny the consequents disjunctively instead 
of categorically you will not thereby make the argument a 
dilemma for if au the consequents be not true the one 
antecedent must fall to the ground e g if a is b c 
is d if a is b £ is f j if a is b g is h but either c is 
not d e is not f or g is not h therefore a is not b 
but in the correct destructive dilemma there is always a 
disjunctive conclusion 

e 



 the dilemma 

designedly and if he be a competent one he will 
not do so undesignedly but a witness who speaks 
false does so either designedly or undesignedly 
therefore he is either not honest or not competent 

 the dilemma may always be reduced into 
simple conditional syllogisms by adding a catego 
rical minor to each antecedent and consequent of 
the major premiss of the dilemma on such a 
statement it will be seen that an opponent could 
not deny both the minors and that he must there 
fore admit one of the conclusions 

 in a constructive dilemma some one of the 
antecedents is assumed to be true and in a de 
structive some one of the consequents assumed to 
be false but which is left undetermined 



 



reduction of hypothetical syllogisms 

 to reduce a hypothetical syllogism into a 
categorical form you must view every conditional 
proposition as a universal affirmative taking the 
antecedent for the suhject and the consequent for 
the predicate

 enthymemes 

camestresmayoi coxase be reduced to celarent 
but even destiuctive conditionals may be stated in 
barbara if you view them as constructive which 
is done by converting by negation the major pre 
miss see no note this process of re 
duction however is explained merely to show the 
applicability of aristotles dictum to every form of 
argument since the rules for hjrpothetical syllo 
gisms are a sufficient test of their validity 

enthymemes 

 the enthymeme is a syllogism with one of 
the premises omitted this premiss is easily sup 
plied by comparing the middle term with that term 
of the conclusion which is expressed only once 
eg 

 isaiah was a prophet theiefore 
he was inspired 

the middle term of course is that which does 
not enter into the conclusion viz prophet 
— isaiah or the minor term is expressed twice 
 inspired the major term only once compare 
therefore the middle term with the major thus sup 
plying the major premiss e g 



of the sorites 

 every prophet is inspired 
isaiah was a prophet therefore 
he was inspired 
if the minor premiss had heen suppressed the 
minor term isaiah could have occurred only 
oncen £ g 

 every prophet is inspired therefore 
isaiah was inspired 
you must in that case have taken the minor 
term isaiah for comparison with the middle 
thus supplying the minor premiss 

 by taking the two propositions of an enthy 
meme for an antecedent and consequent you may 
form it into a conditional syllogism e g if 
isaiah was a prophet he was inspired 

of the sorites 

 a sorites is a hrief form of connecting 
several syllogisms in the first figure in a sorites 
the predicate of the first proposition is made the 

 this is the ordinary way of speaking and writing and 
in this concise form we continually reason in our minds 
iv dvfiff hence the term enthymeme 

f from ffiapdc pile because the propositions are piled 
as it were one on another 



 of the sorites 

subject of the next and so on to any lengthy till 
finally the predicate of the last of the premises is 
predicated in the conclusion of the subject of the 
first 

a is b religion improves the morals 

b is c what improves the morals is 

beneficial to the community 

c is d therefore what is beneficial to the com 

munity deserres encourage 
ment therefore 

a is d religion deserves encourage 

ment 

 in a sorites there aie as many middle terms 
as there are intermediate propositions between the 
first and last the subject of each intermediate pro 
position being a middle term a sorites may there 
fore be drawn out into as many separate syllogisms 
as there are intermediate propositions 

 in drawing out a sorites into distinct syl 
logisms you must take for your major premiss the 
first intermediate proposition of the sorites and 

 by distinct and separate syllogisms i mean those tw 
form with major minor and conclusion into which the 
sorites may be expanded 



of the sorites 

for your minor premiss thejirst proposition of it 
then draw your conclusion the major proposi 
tion of your next syllogism must he the second in 
termediate proposition of the sorites and your 
minor proposition must he the conclusion of your 
preceding syllogism thence draw your second 
conclusion proceed thus till you have formed as 
many distinct syllogisms as the soiites contains 
intermediate propositions and have arrived at the 
same conclusion the sorites gives you only the 
rst minor premiss viz in its first proposition 
all the other minor premises consist of the con 
clusions of your separate syllogisms all your 
major premises consist of the intermediate propo 
sitions of the sorites e g 



i ntermediate prnporitiom

a is e here is a soiites with three intermediate 
propositions to he drawn out into three distinct 
syllogisms

aisc aisd a is £ 



 of the sorites 

 in a sorites ejirst proposition alone ex 
cept of coarse the conclusion may he particular 
because the first proposition is made the minor of 
the distinct syllogism no and may be parti 
cular according to rule either darti or ferio 
the intermediate propositions being all majors of 
the distinct syllogisms must be universals bar 
bara clarent darii fmo 

 the last premiss of the sorites viz the last 
intermediate proposition is the only one that can 
be negative because the last premiss alone never 
gives occasion to employ the conclusion of the dis 
tinct syllogism as the minor of a subsequent one 
should any other premiss of the sorites but 
the last be negative it would lead to a negative 
conclusion no rule and that conclusion 
being made the ibinor of the following syllogism 
would violate the first figure which does not admit 
of a negative minor premiss barbara celarent 
darii ferio 

 a hypothetical sorites consists of a series 
of hypothetical syllogisms in the constructive hy 



 should a sorites appear to have a negative premiss before 
the last the succeeding premiss will shew that the negative 
is in reality a part of one of the terms 



of the sorites 

pothedcal sorites you proceed from the establish 
ment of the first antecedent to the establishment 
of the last consequent e g 
if a is b c is d if it is the duty of a parent to 

take care of his children he 
should keep them as much 
as possible from vice 
if c is d e is f if he should keep them from 

vice he ought to teach them 
what is virtuous 
if e is f g is h if he ought to teach them what 

is virtuous he is bound to 

instruct them in religious 

knowledge 

put a is b but it is the duty of a parent 

therefore to take care of his children 

therefore 
g is h he is bound to instruct them 

in religious knowledge 

in a destructive sorites you go back from the de 
nial of the last consequent to the denial of the first 
antecedent g is not h therefore a is not b

of induction 

 induction is a kind of argument which in 
fers respecting a whole class what has been ascer 
tained respecting one or more subdivisions of that 
class or the drawing a general conclusion from as 
many particular instances as can be brought in to 
bear on the point in question as if on perceiving 
that the ox sheep deer goat and antelope all ru 
minate you should infer that all horned animals 
ruminate inductive arguments which are usually 
stated as enthymemesf no are of course 
easily filled up so as to become regular syllogisms 

 the term induction is sometimes employed to de 
signate the process of investigating and collecting facts 
which is not a process of argument hvxo preparation for it 

f the example given by dr aldrich is inconveniently 
stated for reduction into a syllogistic form a circumstance 



 

epjchirema 

 one of the premises of a syllogism is occa 
sionally confirmed by an incidental proposition 
called a prosyllogism this proposition with the 
premiss it is attached to form an enthymeme no 
 the incidental proposition is the expressed 
premiss of the enthymeme and the premiss it is at 
tached to is the conclusion e g 
 all sin is dangerous 
covetousness is sin for it is a transgression 

of the law therefore 
it is dangerous 

which perhaps occasioned his error pointed out by dr 
whately in directing the student to supply the minor in 
stead of the major premiss of the enthymeme hie et ille 
et iste magnes trahit ferrum ergo omnis the real sub 
ject here is ferrum trahere the real predicate proprium 
hujus et illius et istius magnetis the term expressed but 
once will be the major proprium omnis which must 
therefore be compared with the middle no viz pro 

prium hujus et illius et istius magnetis 

middle term 

i what belongs to this that and the other magnet i is 

mtyor term 

i what belongs to all i 

minor term middle 



i the power of attracting iron i is i what belongs to 

term 
this that and the other magnet i therefore 
minor term major term 



i the power of attracting iron is i what belongs to all i 



 equivalents etc 

the minor premiss is an enthymeme cove 
tonsness is a transgression of the law therefore it 
is sin a syllogism with such a premiss is called 
an epichirema kiriyeipiia i undertake to prove 

equivalents 

 equivalent terms are allowable for brevitys 
sake as the pronoun for the noun equivalent pro 
positions are also allowable as the illative converse 
for the exposita no et seq and such equi 
valents as may be supplied by ranking species 
under genus c 

irregular syllogisms 

 the premises of a valid syllogism may ap 
pear negative contrary to rule no one of 
the premises should then be stated as an affirmative 
see note to no it is the same c 

 no one is wise who is not virtuous 
no gamester is virtuous therefore 
no gamester is wise 
the real middle term in this syllogism is not 
virtuous and it is in celarent 

 he who is notvirtuous is not wise 
a gamester is notvirtuous therefore 
he is not wise 



irregular syllogisms 

 from the variety of expression admissible 
in language the logical order of subject and predi 
cate is often inverted and this will occasion the 
appearance of too many terms in the syllogism 
all that is requisite in such cases is to restce the 
subject and predicate to their proper order eg 
no irrational agent could produce a work 
which manifests design 
the universe is a work which manifests design 

therefore 
no irrational agent could have produced the 
universe 
strictly considered this syllogism has five 
terms viz an irrational agent a being 
aue to produce a work which manifests design 
 the universe a work which manifests de 
sigi d a hng aue to produce the universe 

 middle term copula 

i a work which manifests design i could not 

andmqjor term 

be produced by an irrational agent i 

minor term middle 






i the universe i is a work which manifests 

term 

design i therefore 

minor t copula and mtigor term 

i it i i could not be produced by an irra 



tional agent i 



 irregular syllogisms 

 the above iitegularity is sometimes accom 
panied with a transposition of the premises as in 
the following syllogism which appears to be in the 
second figure and faulty from an affirmative con 
clusion note to no 

 every true patriot is disinterested 
few men are disinterested therefore 
few men are true patriots 
it is in reality barbara with a transposition 
of the premises and of the terms of the major 
proposition for you do not predicate of few men 
that they are disinterested but of disinterested 
men that they are few 

 disinterested men are few 
true patriots are disinterested men therefore 
true patriots are few 

 by the use of conversion and equipollent 
propositions such irregularities as the following 
are easily reduced to form 

 none but candid men are good reasoners 
few infidels are candid therefore 
few infidels are good reasoners 
the major premiss here is equipollent to they 
who are not candid men are not good reasoners 
which is the converse by negation of all good 
reasoners are candid men no state your 



irregular syllogisms 

major proposition in a accordingly the minor 
premiss and the conclusion are equipollent to 
 most infidels are not candid therefore most 
infidels are not good reasoners this will he a 
regular syllogism in camestres or fakoro or it • 
may he stated at once in celarent or ferio 
they who are not candid or uncandid 

copula 

 aie not i good reasoners 

copula 

most infidels i are notcandid or uncandid 
therefore 

copula 

most infidels i are not good reasonersf 

 i have said camestres or fakoro and celarent or 
ferio because most cannot designate absolute univer 
sality though the present case may be thought to amount 
to a moral one see note to no and uniyersality 
in the index 

f for the attainment of skill in syllogizing as in every 
other intellectual process true it is that sapereest et 
principium et fons without good sense and some com 
mand of expression it will often be very difficult for a stu 
dent to state inform many arguments that are sufficiently 
conclusive on the other hand some proficiency in logic 
as an art is essential to the ready performance of this 
exercise however simple it may appear though good 
sense and command of expression are indispensable they 
are not of themselves sufficient a study then which 
both tries the faculties of the mind and calls into play the 
resources of phraseology is surely to be considered as 
worthy of a place in the scheme of a liberal education

on academical disputation 

the respondent in a disputation being always 
supposed to maintain a true proposition the argu 
ment of the opponent whose province it is to sup 
port the contradictory must be presumed to be 
founded on some fallacy 

if the respondent upon trying his opponent s 
objection in the form of a categorical syllogism 
should find that it offends against any one of the 
six rules in no by pointing out such a viola 
tion he overthrows the opponent s argument 

should the objection be hypothetical the res 
pondent must examine the connexion between an 
tecedent and consequent no and whether the

two rules at no have been observed the detec 
tion also of any violation of the rules for drawing 
a conclusion from disjunctive propositions nos 
 will destroy a fallacy so supported 

fallacies that consist in a violation of the express 
rules of logic are more palpable than those which 
depend on the ambiguity of the middle term by 
an ingenious application of which to the terms of 
the question no rule fallacies are very 
generally introduced 

most frequently therefore the first business of 
the respondent is to examine the middle term of 
his opponents argument and ascertain whether 
in his comparison of it with the terms of his con 
clusion he has used it in exactly the same sense in 
both instances the first and second intention of 
words their being employed sometimes in a literal 
and sometimes in a metaphorical sense with other 
considerations arising from the various meanings 
attached to the same or similar terms afford a 
wide scope for the exercise of fallacy and call for 
acuteness both natural and acquired to detect it 
if skilfully concealed 

the opponent has the choice of many points of

by the respondent appears at all inconsistent with 
any part of the system he is defending or at va 
riance with any received principle of truth c or 
expressed in terms of too extensive a latitude — by 
driving the respondent to explain such a difficulty 
he has fairly executed his task 

the cambridge argument now practised by the 
opponent at a public disputation in the schools 
generally consists of three constructive conditional 
syllogisms no the consequent no in 
the first syllogism is always cadit quaestio if 
the respondent should deny the consequence or 
conclusion then the consequent of the second syl 
logismwill be valet consequentia on the con 
trary if he should deny the minor no the 
consequent of the second syllogism will be valet 
minor if the respondent should deny the conse 
quence of the second syllogism the consequent of 
the third will be valent consequentia et argu 
mentum if he should deny the minor of the 
second the consequent of the third will be valent 
minor et argumentum

nied whether it be the minor or consequence the 
opponent in his next syllogism affirms to be valid 
taking for the consequent of his major proposition 
 valet minor or valet consequentia as the 
case may be 

should the argument consist of only two syllo 
gisms the former will have for its consequent 
 cadit quaestio and the latter either valent 
consequentia et argumentum or valent minor 
et argumentum according to the previous denial 
of the respondent should it consist of more than 
three all except the last will have their consequent 
in the same manner as the second either valet 
consequentia or valet minor the consequent 
of the concluding syllogism is always valent 
consequentia et argumentum or valent minor 
et argumentum it is not however advisable to 
use more than thiee syllogisms in constructing an 
argument for a disputation 

it is the duty of the respondent at the close of 
each syllogism either to concede or deny the minor 
proposition as circumstances may require if it 
be evidently true he must of course concede it

should the minor of a concluding syllogism be 
false the respondent does not say nego minorem 
but proceeds at once to his reply 

the antecedent as may be seen in the preceding 
examples is first enunciated in the subjunctive or 
at least conditionally then affirmed in the minor 
premissin the indicative mood and the consequent 
accordingly established 

it may happen that the three conditional syllo 
gisms admit of being reduced to the form of a single 



on academical disputation 

categorical syllogism to the major minor and 
conclusion of which they severally correspond 
but even in instances of this kind it is not neces 
sary that the three conditional syllogisms should be 
placed in the same order as the three propositions 
of the categorical syllogism if the opponent thinks 
that by a different arrangement his sophism will 
be the better concealed 

the three conditional syllogisms of an opponents 
argument when they do not correspond with 
the three propositions of a categorical syllogism 
would require in order to be stated in form to be 
expanded into two or more categorical syllogisms 

in responding to an opponent it is by no means 
necessary to unfold in ones mind the objections he 
has adduced into as many strict categorical syllo 
gisms as will lead to his conclusion for this would 
often be a trifling and tedious process to the res 
pondent though it is highly desirable to possess 
the skill that would enable him if required to go 
through it 

should the respondent from the subtlety of his 
opponents sophism or any other cause experience 
great difficulty in discovering the pith of the objec 
tion the moderator usually assists him by re

stating the opponents argument in a more lucid 
and intuigible form and sometimes directing his 
attention to the quaiter in which the fallacy is 
hidden 

it has been already stated to be the opponents 
province should the respondent deny the minor of 
his syllogism to confirm it by some medium of 
proof this in the divinityschool is generally done 
by an appeal to texts of scripture which it may be 
observed are commonly cited without being called 
for by the respondent as they often afibrd ground 
for critical animadversion on the part of the pro 
fessor and opportunity for a further trial of the 
skill and knowledge of the disputants 

it is usual for the professor to call on the respon 
dent for an interpretation into latin of the more 
abstruse and diflscult texts of the new testament 
that may happen to be quoted by the opponent 
for citations from the old testament the vulgate 
is employed 

when the respondent has replied to the oppo 
nents objection the moderator occasionally demands 

 a copy of the greek new testament and of the vulgate 
version of the old are placed on the desk of the respon 
dents rostnim

constructed 

the following is the form of a divinity act with 
a specimen of the style of argumentation as prac 
tised in the university of camhridge the com 
piler in conformity with the principles laid down 
in the preceding part of this manual has at the 
hottom of the page unfolded each argument in a 
categorical form 

the preliminaries of a divinity act the formula 
of the prayers the hahit of the respondent c are 
detailed in the ceremonies of the university of 
cambridge edited by h gunning esq 

every one about to keep a divinity act first sub 
mits to the regius professor three or four ques 
tions which should be on some important doctiine 
of the christian religion or leading article of the 
protestant faith the professor having selected 
one of these questions the respondent that is to 
be makes it the subject of a latin thesis the de 
livery of which ought not to occupy more than 
halfanhom 

 the church articles supply suitable subjects for dis 
putation a good list of questions that have been already 
discussed is to be found in the preface to bishop watsons 
theological tracts 



 appendix 

about ten days before the act is kept the res 
pondent should wait on the professor in order to 
obtain of him the second question this is always 
chosen exclusively by the professor himself who 
when the disputation is ended delivers a thesis 
called a determination upon it it is the pro 
vince of the respondent to answer the ailments 
brought against both questions 



 it is greatly to be regretted that majiy clergrmen after 
entering on the public duties of their office should often 
neglect to cultivate the advantages conferred on them by a 
university education not that it is desirable or even de 
fensible that a minister of the gospel should employ much 
of his time either in classical or philosophical researches 
but some familiarity with theological greek and latin might 
fairly be expected of every divine however arduous the du 
ties of his parish may be it is incredible how much time 
may be snatched for improvement out of the busiest and 
most laborious life erasmus wrote his praise of folly 
while travelling on horseback into italy ne totum illud 
tempus quo equo fuit insidendum illiteratis fabulis terere 



tur 



 no one who has discontinued for many years a moderate 
cultivation of greek and latin can proceed to the higher 
degrees at the university without disagreeable anticipations 
of embarrassment and disgrace in the attempt to hold a 
public disputation 

the writings of limborch may be very useful to ay one 
preparing for a divinity act 



on academical disputation 

on the professor having ascended his rostrum 
he directs the respondent to begin agas do 
mine the respondent then says oremus and 
pronounces the prayer actiones nostras c 
he afterwards proposes the questions thus 

 quastiones sunt exempli gratia 

 ohlatio ckristi semel facta perfecta redemptio 
est 

 • fides justificans non potest k bonis operibm dis 
jungt 

as the question on which the respondent has 
composed his thesis is always proposed first he 
then says de priori and proceeds to deliver 
his thesis 

when the thesis is concluded the first opponent 
is directed by the professor to ascend the rostrum 
 ascendat opponentium primus 

the opponent then reads the two questions as 
the respondent had done before and proceeds to 
his arguments 

to give as clear an idea as possible of the manner 
of opposing and responding the discussion of the 
first argument is here exhibited in the form of dia

opponens 

 si doctrina de redemptione humana hoc funda

 the conditional syllogisms of which this objection 
consists correspond with the three propositions of a regular 
categorical syllogism and it may be viewed as cezarenf with 
the premises transposed christ was the paschal lamb 
the paschal lamb was not a piacular sacrifice therefore 
christ was not a piacular sacrifice 

ce the paschal lamb was not a piacular sacrifice 

la christ was the paschal lamb therefore 

rent christ was not a piacular sacrifice 
in the major proposition the middle term the paschal 
lamb is used in its primary and literal sense in the minor 
proposition in its secondary and metaphorical sense it is 
not therefore fairly compared with the terms of the con 
clusion or question this is fallacia aequivocationis 
after all the truth of the msgor proposition admits of 
doubt

appear thus

is irreconcileable with justice therefore

ba a feast upon propitiatory offerings is what a sacrifi 
cial feast was to the jews and heathens there 
fore

supper is to christians 

 

bar a christian propitiatory offering is the oblation of 
christ 

ba what takes place in the lords supper is a chris 
tian propitiatory offering therefore 

ra what takes place in the lords supper is the obla 
tion of christ 

 

bar what takes place in the lords supper is frequently 

repeated 
ba the propitiatory oblation of christ is what takes 

place in the lords supper therefore 
ra it is frequently repeated 

 the middle term of the first syllogism is here taken in 
different senses in the major and minor premiss in the 
major premiss it means what a sacrificial feast was with 
regard to one particular viz communion with the deity

this and the following argument are against 
the second question according to the rules for 
keeping a first opponency

 si fides lustificationem antecedat cadit qusestio 
sed fides justificationem antecedit 

ergo cadit qusestio

and thus in that particular it agprees with the major term 
in the minor premiss it is taken simply and thus in 
another particular viz its propitiatory character it agrees 
with the minor term it is not therefore irly compared 
with the terms of the conclusion this may be referred to

 the opponent don tends that as justifying faith pre 
cedes justification and all works before justification are 
sinful therefore justifying faith may eidst apart from good 
works the formal statement of this argument requires 
four categorical syllogisms 

 

ce works that have in them the nature of sin are not 

good works 
la all works done before justification have in them 

the nature of sin therefore 
rent no works done before justification are good works 

 

bar whatever is preceded by justification is preceded 

by what precedes justification 
ba good works are preceded by justification therefore

faith may be separated from good works only in thought 
faith is the fountainhead good works the streams that 
ffow from it faith is the cause good works the eeect 
as soon as there is faith justification begins and good 
works immediately follow as therefore the sun must 
hare existed before the sunbeams so faith must be previous 
to good works but if there be faith good works are of 
necessity produced nor can they any more be separated 
from faith than light can be parted from the sun

 the reward of him who works says the opponent is 
shewn in scripture to be not of race but of debt but 
our reward viz justification by faith is proved by scrip 
ture to be of grace therefore it cannot be the reward of 
him who works nor is justifying faith connected with good 
works this argument in order to be formally stated re 
quires like the last four categorical syllogisms 

 

ce that which is of debt is not of grace 

la the reward of him who works is of debt therefore 

rent it is not of grace 

 

ce what is of grace is not the reward of him who 

works 
converse of the conclusion of the last syllogism e 
la justification by faith is of grace therefore 
rent it is not the reward of him who works

more connexion with good works than justifica

la justifying faith is the instrumental cause of justi 
fication therefore 

rent it has no more connexion with good works than 
justification itself has 

the major proposition of the third syllogism is unduly 
assumed that which is not the reward of works may yet 
have connexion with them in other rttpeds though jus 
tification is a favour not a reward of works yet works may 
be required as a conditum of justification and in this re 
spect they may be inseparably connected this circum 
stance does not diminish our debt of gratitude to grod to 
whose grace as the efficient cause all spiritual blessings are 
ascribable 

they who object to call good works conditions of 
salvation may term them the necessary fruits of the faith 
whereby we obtain salvation although salvation itself must 
be accounted a gratuitous benefit of god

acts in the civil law 

before keeping an act in the civil law the 
student submits to the regius professor in that 
faculty a few questions that he may x on one of 
them as a fit subject for a lalan thesis 

• 

 a candidate for the degree of llb must submit to 
the professor the question he means to write upon at least 
one term before the act is kept a candidate for the de 
gree of lld must do the same at least two terms pre 
viously to his act

a second question is also chosen by the professor 
exclusively who reads a determination on it when 
the disputation is finished 

on the day of the exercise the respondent 
having occupied his rostrum and the professor 
being seated the father of the respondents college 
directs him to begin domine respondens

hy the professor in his examination paper of the present 
year other questions in ms are also given to each stu

on academical disputation 

the respondent then proposes the questions 
placing that first on which his thesis is written 

except when an opponency is kept for a doctors 
degree the regius professor is himself both oppo 
nent and moderator he produces as many argu 
ments against each question as he thinks proper 
in the form of syllogism already explained 

it is the office of the respondent as in the divi 
nity school to defend each question by an appro 
priate answer to the objections adduced by the op 
ponent 

if the answer of the respondent be satisfactory to 
the professor he signifies his approbation and pro 
ceeds in the capacity of opponent to propose his 
next argument but if the answer of the respon 
dent be eitoneous or inconclusive the professor 
departing for the time from the character of op 
ponent points out to the respondentthe true solu 
tion of the difficulty and this he does not only 
for the advantage of the respondent but for the in 
struction of the auditors frequenting the lawschool 
the majority of whom attend there expressly with 
a view to prepare themselves for responding in a

a medical thesis may be composed on any prac 
tical physiological or pathological question it 
must be of such a length as not to consume more 
than halfanhour in the delivery 



on academical disputation 

for the degree of m b the question must be 
submitted to the professor for his approval six 
weeks before the act is kept and for the degree of 
m d three months before 

the respondent has to defend two questions of 
which one is appointed exclusively by the professoi 
as in the case of a divinity act 

the professor does not restrict the opponent from 
extending the number of his arguments if he 
pleases but he must not produce fewer than five 
in all i e three against the first question and two 
against the second each of these arguments may 
consist of two three or four syllogisms 

there is but one opponent and if the act be 
kept for a doctors degree the opponent is most 
frequently the professor himself 

the forms of keeping an act in medicine cor 
respond with those observed in keeping an act in

which the moderator holds to be true the truth

be accordingly given in his favour the following 
however are specimens in which the position main 
tained is true and the objections fallacious

acts in the school of arts 

the preliminaries of these acts are of necessity 
well known to all who are concerned in keeping 
them no one can oppose or respond in the school 
of alls till he has resided seven terms in the 
university a paiticular introduction to the 
following questions would therefore be superflu 
ous

 si cum spiralis reciproca in antecedentia revel 
vatur eadem velocitate angulari qua corpus in conse 
quentia movetur orbita in fixe spatio descripta fiat 



on academical disputation 

linea recta in qua corpus motu uniformi ad centrum 
accedit cadit qusbstio 

sed cum c fit c accedit 

ergo cadit qusdstio 

 si cum vis in spirali reciproca varietur et 
virium differentia in orbita quiescente et in orbita in 
fixo spatio descripta varietur similiter consequens 
sit totam vim in orbita in fixo spatio descripta variari 
— valet consequentia 

sed cum vis c consequens est c 
ergo valet consequentia 

 si vero cum vis varietur corpus nequeat in 
recta linea ad centrum descendere motu uniformi 
valent consequentia et argumentum 

sed cum c nequit c 

ergo valent consequentia et argumentum 

respgnsum 

differentia virium centripetarum et centrifugarum 
in orbita in fixo spatio descripta eadem est ac in orbita 
quiescente sed in spirali reciproca vires centripeta 
et centrifuga squales sunt ergo in recta linea quae in 
fixo spatio describitur sequales sunt ideoque corpus 
nulla vi impulsum velocitate prima ad centruni 
uniformiter accedit 

the first opponent produces two other similar 
arguments against the first question
