preface 



in presenting this work to public notice i deem it not 
irrelevant to observe that speculations similar to those which 
it records have at different periods occupied my thoughts 
in the spring of the present year my attention was directed 
to the question then moved between sir w hamilton and 
professor de morgan and i was induced by the interest 
which it inspired to resume the almostforgotten thread of 
former inquiries it appeared to me that although logic 
might be viewed with reference to the idea of quantity it 
had also another and a deeper system of relations slf it was 
lawful to regard it from without as connecting itself through 
the medium of number with the intuitions of space and time 
it was lawful also to regard it from within as based upon 
facts of another order which have their abode in the consti 
tution of the mind the results of this view and of the 
inquiries which it suggested are embodied in the following 
treatise 

it is not generally permitted to an author to prescribe 
the mode in which his production shall be judged but there 
are two conditions which i may venture to require of those 
who shall undertake to estimate the merits of this performance 
the first is that no preconceived notion of the impossibility 
of its objects shall be permitted to interfere with that candour 
and impartiality which the investigation of truth demands 
the second is that their judgment of the system as a whole 
shall not be founded either upon the examination of only

preface 

a part of it or upon the measure of its conformity with any 
received system considered as a standard of reference from 
which appeal is denied it is in the general theorems which 
occupy the latter chapters of this work — results to which there 
is no existing counterpart— that the claims of the method as 
a calculus of deductive reasoning are most fully set forth 

what may be the final estimate of the value of the system 
i have neither the wish nor the right to anticipate the 
estimation of a theory is not simply determined by its truth 
it also depends upon the importance of its subject and the 
extent of its applications beyond which something must still 
be left to the arbitrariness of human opinion if the utility 
of the application of mathematical forms to the science of 
logic were solely a question of notation i should be content 
to rest the defence of this attempt upon a principle which has 
been stated by an able living writer whenever the nature 
of the subject permits the reasoning process to be without 
danger carried on mechanically the language should be con 
structed on as mechanical principles as possible while in the 
contrary case it should be so constructed that there shall be 
the greatest possible obstacle to a mere mechanical use of it 
in one respect the science of logic differs from all others 
the perfection of its method is chiefly valuable as an evidence 
of the speculative truth of its principles to supersede the 
employment of common reason or to subject it to the rigour 
of technical forms would be the last desire of one who knows 
the value of that intellectual toil and warfare which imparts 
to the mind an athletic vigour and teaches it to contend 
with difficulties and to rely upon itself in emergencies

mathematical analysis of logic 



introductiolsr 

they who are acquainted with the present state of the theory 
of symbolical algebra are aware that the validity of the 
processes of analysis does not depend upon the interpretation 
of the symbols which are employed but solely upon the laws 
of their combination every system of interpretation which 
does not affect the truth of the relations supposed is equally 
admissible and it is thus that the same process may under 
one scheme of interpretation represent the solution of a ques 
tion on the properties of numbers under another that of 
a geometrical problem and under a third that of a problem 
of dynamics or optics this principle is indeed of fundamental 
importance and it may with safety be affirmed that the recent 
advances of pure analysis have been much assisted by the 
inuence which it has exerted in directing the current of 
investigation 

but the full recognition of the consequences of this important 
doctrine has been in some measure retarded by accidental 
circumstances it has happened in every known form of 
analysis that the elements to be determined have been con 
ceived as measurable by comparison with some fixed standard 
the predominant idea has been that of magnitude or more 
strictly of numerical ratio the expression of magnitude or 



 introduction 

of operations upon magnitude has been the express object 
for which the symbols of analysis have been invented and 
for which their laws have been investigated thus the ab 
stractions of the modern analysis not less than the ostensive 
diagrams of the ancient geometry have encouraged the notion 
that mathematics are essentially as well as actually the science 
of magnitude 

the consideration of that view which has already been stated 
as embodying the true principle of the algebra of symbols 
would however lead us to infer that this conclusion is by no 
means necessary if every existing interpretation is shewn to 
involve the idea of magnitude it is only by induction that we 
can assert that no other interpretation is possible and it may 
be doubted whether our experience is sufficient to render such 
an induction legitimate the history of pure analysis is it may 
be said too recent to permit us to set limits to the extent of its 
applications should we grant to the inference a high degree 
of probability we might still and with reason maintain the 
sufficiency of the definition to which the principle aheady stated 
would lead us we might justly assign it as the definitive 
character of a true calculus that it is a method resting upon 
the employment of symbols whose laws of combination are 
known and general and whose results admit of a consistent 
interpretation that to the existing forms of analysis a quan 
titative interpretation is assigned is the result of the circum 
stances by which those forms were determined and is not to 
be construed into a universal condition of analysis it is upon 
the foundation of this general principle that i purpose to 
establish the calculus of logic and that i claim for it a place 
among the acknowledged forms of mathematical analysis re 
gardless that in its object and in its instruments it must at 
present stand alone 

that which renders logic possible is the existence in our 
minds of general notions — our ability to conceive of a class 
and to designate its individual members by a common name 



introduction o 

the theory of logic is thus intimately connected with that of 
language a successful attempt to express logical proposition 
by symbols the laws of whose eorabiuations should be founded 
upon the laws of the mental processes which they represent 
would so far be a step toward a philosophical language but 
this is a view which we need not here follow into detail 
assuming the notion of a class we are able from any con 
ceivable couection of objects to separate by a mental act those 
which belong to the giyen class and to contemplate them apart 
from the rest such or a similar act of election we may con 
ceive to be repeated the group of individuals left under con 
sideration may be still further limited by mentally selecting 
those among them which belong to some other recognised class 
as well as to the one before contemplated and this process 
may be repeated with other elements of distinction until we 
arrive at an individual possessing all the distinctive characters 
which we have taken into account and a member at the same 
time of every class which we have enumerated it is in fact 
a method similar to this which we employ whenever in common 
language we accumulate descriptive epithets for the sake of 
more precise definition 

now the several mental operations which in the above case 
we have supposed to be performed are subject to peculiar laws 
it is possible to assign relations among them whether as re 
spects the repetition of a given operation or the succession of 
different ones or some other particular which are never violated 
it is for example true that the result of two successive acts is 

 this view is well expressed in one of blanco whites letteis — logic is 
for the most part a collection of technical rules founded on classification the 
syllogism is nothing but a result of the classification of things which the mind 
naturally and necessarily forms in forming a language all abstract terms are 
classifications or rather the labels of the classes which the mind has settled

unaffected by the order in which they are performed and there 
are at least two other laws which will be pointed out in te 
proper place these will perhaps to some appear so obvious as 
to be ranked among necessary truths and so little important 
as to be undeserving of special notice and probably they are 
noticed for the first time in this essay yet it may with con 
fidence be asserted that if they were other than they are the 
entire mechanism of reasoning nay the very laws and constitu 
tion of the human intellect would be vitally changed a logic 
might indeed exist but it would no longer be the logic we 
possess 

such are the elementary laws upon the existence of which 
and upon their capability of exact symbolical expression the 
method of the following essay is founded and it is presumed 
that the object which it seeks to attain will be thought to 
have been very fully accomplished every logical proposition 
whether categorical or hypothetical will be found to be capable 
of exact and rigorous expression and not only will the laws of 
conversion and of syllogism be thence deducible but the resolu 
tion of the most complex systems of propositions the separation 
of any proposed element and the expression of its value in 
tepms of the remaining elements with every subsidiary rela 
tion involved every process will represent deduction every 
mathematical consequence will express a logical inference the 
generality of the method will even permit us to express arbi 
trary operations of the intellect and thus lead to the demon 
stration of general theorems in logic analogous in no slight 
degree to the general theorems of ordinary mathematics no 
inconsiderable part of the pleasure which we derive from the 
application of analysis to the interpretation of external nature 
arises from the conceptions which it enables us to form of the 
universality of the dominion of law the general formulae to 
which we are conducted seem to give to that element a visible 
presence and the multitude of particular cases to which they 
apply demonstrate the extent of its sway even the symmetry 



introduction 

of tlieir analytical expression may in no fanciful sense be 
deemed indicative of its harmony and its consistency now i 
do not presume to say to what extent the same sources of 
pleasure are opened in the following essay the measure of 
that extent may be left to the estimate of those who shau think 
the subject worthy of their study but i may venture to 
assert that such occasions of intellectual gratification are not 
here wanting the laws we have to examine are the laws of 
one of the most important of our mental faculties the mathe 
matics we have to construct are the mathematics of the human 
intellect nor are the form and character of the method apart 
from all regard to its interpretation undeserving of notice 
there is even a remarkable exemplification in its general 
theorems of that species of excellence which consists in free 
dom from exception and this is observed where in the cor 
responding cases of the received mathematics such a character 
is by no means apparent the few who think that there is that 
in analysis which renders it deserving of attention for its own 
sake may find it worth while to study it under a form in which 
every equation can be solved and every solution interpreted 
nor will it lessen the interest of this study to reflect that every 
peculiarity which they will notice in the form of the calculus 
represents a corresponding feature in the constitution of their 
own minds 

it would be premature to speak of the value which this 
method may possess as an instrument of scientific investigation 
i speak here with reference to the theory of reasoning and to 
the principle of a true classification of the forms and cases of 
logic considered as a science the aim of these investigations 
was in the first instance confined to the expression of the 
received logic and to the forms of the aristotelian arrangement

o introduction 

but it soon became apparent that restrictions were thus intro 
duced which were purely arbitrary and had no foundation in 
the nature of things these were noted as they occurred and 
will be discussed in the proper place when it became neces 
sary to consider the subject of hypothetical propositions in which 
comparatively less has been done and still more when an 
interpretation was demanded for the general theorems of the 
calculus it was found to be imperative to dismiss all regard for 
precedent and authority and to interrogate the method itself for 
an expression of the just limits of its application still how 
ever there was no special effort to arrive at novel results but 
among those which at the time of their discovery appeared to be 
such it may be proper to notice the following 

a logical proposition is according to the method of this essay 
expressible by an equation the form of which determines the 
rules of conversion and of transformation to which the given 
proposition is subject thus the law of what logicians term 
simple conversion is determined by the fact that the corre 
sponding equations are symmetrical that they are unaifected by 
a mutual change of place in those symbols which correspond 
to the convertible classes the received laws of conversion 
were thus determined and afterwards another system which is 
thought to be more elementary and more general see chapter 
on the conversioi of piopositions 

the premises of a syllogism being expressed by equations the 
elimination of a common symbol between them leads to a third 
equation which expresses the conclusion this conclusion being 
always the most general possible whether aristotelian or not 
among the cases in which no inference was possible it was 
found that there were two distinct forms of the final equation 
it was a considerable time before the explanation of this fact 
was discovered but it was at length seen to depend upon the 
presence or absence of a true medium of comparison between 
the premises the distinction which is thought to be new 
is illustrated in the chapter on syllogisms 



introduction 

the nonexclusive character of the disjunctive conclusion of 
a hypothetical syllogism is very clearly pointed out in the 
examples of this species of argument 

the class of logical problems illustrated in the chapter on 
the solution of elective equations is conceived to be new and 
it is believed that the method of that chapter affords the means 
of a perfect analysis of any conceivable system of propositions 
an end toward which the rules for the conversion of a single 
categorical proposition are but the first step 

however upon the originality of these or any of these views 
i am conscious that i possess too slight an acquaintance with the 
literature of logical science and especially with its older lite 
rature to permit me to speak with confidence 

it may not be inappropriate before concluding these obser 
vations to offer a few remarks upon the general question of the 
use of symbolical language in the mathematics objections 
have lately been very strongly urged against this practice on 
the ground that by obviating the necessity of thought and 
substituting a reference to general formulae in the room of 
personal eflfort it tends to weaken the reasoning faculties 

now the question of the use of symbols may be considered 
in two distinct points of view first it may be considered with 
reference to the progress of scientific discovery and secondly 
with reference to its bearing upon the discipline of the intellect 

and with respect to the first view it may be observed that 
as it is one fruit of an accomplished labour that it sets us at 
liberty to engage in more arduous toils so it is a necessary 
result of an advanced state of science that we are permitted 
and even called upon to proceed to higher problems than those 
which we before contemplated the practical inference is 
obvious if through the advancing power of scientific methods 
we find that the pursuits on which we were once engaged 
afford no longer a sufficiently ample field for intellectual effort 
the remedy is to proceed to higher inquiries and in new 
tracks to seek for difficulties yet unsubdued and such is 



 introduction 

indeed the actual law of scientific progress we must be 
content either to abandon the hope of further conquest or to 
employ such aids of symbolical language as are proper to the 
stage of progress at which we have arrived nor need we fear 
to commit ourselves to such a course we have not yet arrived 
so near to the boundaries of possible knowledge as to suggest 
the apprehension that scope will fail for the exercise of the 
inventive faculties 

in discussing the second and scarcely less momentous ques 
tion of the influence of the use of symbols upon the discipline 
of the intellect an important distinction ought to be made it 
is of most material consequence whether those symbols are 
used with a full understanding of their meaning with a perfect 
comprehension of that which renders their use lawful and an 
ability to expand the abbreviated forms of reasoning which the 
induce into their full syllogistic devolopment or whether they 
are mere unsuggestive characters the use of which is suffered 
to rest upon authority 

the answer which must be given to the question proposed 
will differ according as the one or the other of these suppositions 
is admitted in the former case an intellectual discipline of a 
high order is provided an exercise not only of reason but of 
the faculty of generalization in the latter case there is no 
mental discipline whatever it were perhaps the best secuiity 
against the danger of an unreasoning reliance upon symbols 
on the one hand and a neglect of their just claims on the other 
that each subject of applied mathematics should be treated in the 
spirit of the methods which were known at the time when the 
application was made but in the best form which those methods 
have assumed the order of attainment in the individual mind 
would thus bear some relation to the actual order of scientific 
discovery and the more abstract methods of the higher analysis 
would be offered to such minds only as were prepared to 
receive them 

the relation in which this essay stands at once to logic and 



introduction 

to mathematics may further justify some notice of the question 
which has lately been revived as to the relative value of the two 
studies in a liberal education one of the chief objections which 
have been urged against the study of mathematics in general is 
but another form of that which has been already considered with 
respect to the use of symbols in particular and it need not here 
be further dwelt upon than to notice that if it avails anything 
it applies with an equal force against the study of logic the 
canonical forms of the aristotelian syllogism are really symbol 
ical only the symbols are less perfect of their kind than those 
of mathematics if they are employed to test the validity of an 
argument they as truly supersede the exercise of reason as does 
a reference to a formula of analysis whether men do in the 
present day make this use of the aristotelian canons except as 
a special illustration of the rules of logic may be doubted yet 
it cannot be questioned that when the authority of aristotle was 
dominant in the schools of europe such applications were habit 
ually made and our argument only requires the admission 
that the case is possible 

but the question before us has been argued upon higher 
grounds regarding logic as a branch of philosophy and de 
fining philosophy as the science of a real existence and the 
research of causes and assigning as its main biisiness the inves 
tigation of the why to stortj while mathematics display 
only the that to oti sir w hamilton has contended 
not simply that the superiority rests with the study of logic 
but that the study of mathematics is at once dangerous and use 
less the pursuits of the mathematician have not only not 
trained him to that acute scent to that delicate almost instinc 
tive tact which in the twilight of probability the search and 
discrimination of its finer facts demand they have gone to cloud 
his vision to indurate his touch to all but the blazing light the 
iron chain of demonstration and left him out of the narrow con 
fines of his science to a passive credulity in any premises or to

 introduction 

an absolute incredulity in all in support of these and of othef 
charges both argument and copious authority are adduced 
i shall not attempt a complete discussion of the topics which 
are suggested by these remarks my object is not controversy 
and the observations which follow are offered not in the spirit 
of antagonism but in the hope of contributing to the formation 
of just views upon an important subject of sir w hamilton 
it is impossible to speak otherwise than with that respect which 
is due to genius and learning 

philosophy is then described as the science of a real existence 
and the research of causes and that no doubt may rest upon 
the meaning of the word cause it is further said that philosophy 
 mainly investigates the why these definitions are common 
among the ancient writers thus seneca one of sir w hamil 
tons authorities epistle lxxxviii the philosopher seeks 
and knows the causes of natural things of which the mathe 
matician searches out and computes the numbers and the mea 
sures it may be remarked in passing that in whatever 
degree the belief has prevailed that the business of philosophy 
is immediately with causes in the same degree has every 
science whose object is the investigation of laws been lightly 
esteemed thus the epistle to which we have referred bestows 
by contrast with philosophy a separate condemnation on music 
and grammar on mathematics and astronomy although it is 
that of mathematics only that sir w hamilton has quoted 

now we might take our stand upon the conviction of many 
thoughtful and reflective minds that in the extent of the mean 
ing above stated philosophy is impossible the business of 
true science they conclude is with laws and phenomena the 
nature of being the mode of the operation of cause the why 

 the arguments are in general better than the authorities many writers 
quoted in condemnation of mathematics aristo seneca jerome augustine 
corneliu agrippa c have borne a no less explicit testimony against other 
sciences nor least of all against that of logic the treatise of the last named 
writer de vanitate scimtiarum must surely have been referred to by mistake — 
vide cap cii 



introductioh 

they hold to be beyond the reach of our intelligence but we 
do not require the vantageground of this position nor is it 
doubted that whether the aim of philosophy is attainable or not 
the desire which impels us to the attempt is an instinct of our 
higher nature let it be granted that the problem which has 
baffled the efforts of ages is not a hopeless one that the 
 science of a real existence and the research of causes 
 that kernel for which philosophy is still militant do 
not transcend the limits of the human intellect i am then 
compelled to assert that according to this view of the nature of 
philosophy logic forms no part of it on the principle of 
a true classification we ought no longer to associate logic and 
metaphysics but logic and mathematics 

should any one after what has been said entertain a doubt 
upon this point i must refer him to the evidence which will be 
afforded in the following essay he will there see logic resting 
like geometry upon axiomatic truths and its theorems con 
structed upon that general doctrine of symbols which consti 
tutes the foundation of the recognised analysis in the logic 
of aristotle he will be led to view a collection of the formulae 
of the science expressed by another but it is thought less 
perfect scheme of symbols i feel bound to contend for the 
absolute exactness of this parallel it is no escape from the con 
clusion to which it points to assert that logic not only constructs 
a science but also inquires into the origin and the nature of its 
own principles — a distinction which is denied to mathematics 
 it is wholly beyond the domain of mathematicians it is said 
 to inquire into the origin and nature of their principles — 
review page but upon what ground can such a distinc 
tion be maintained avhat definition of the term science will 
be found sufficiently arbitrary to allow such differences 

the application of this conclusion to the question before us is 
clear and decisive the mental discipline which is afforded by 
the study of logic as an exact science is in species the same 
as that afforded by the study of analysis 



 introduction 

is it then contended that either logic or mathematics can 
supply a perfect discipline to the intellect the most careful 
and unprejudiced examination of this question leads me to doubt 
whether such a position can be maintained the exclusive claims 
of either must i believe be abandoned nor can any others par 
taking of a like exclusive character be admitted in their room 
it is an important observation which has more than once been 
made that it is one thing to arrive at correct premises and another 
thing to deduce logical conclusions and that the business of life 
depends more upon the former than upon the latter the study 
of the exact sciences may teach us the one and it may give us 
some general preparation of knowledge and of practice for the 
attainment of the other but it is to the union of thought with 
action in the field of practical logic the arena of human life 
that we are to look for its fuller and more perfect accomplishment 

i desire here to express my conviction that with the ad 
vance of our knowledge of all true science an everincreasing 
harmony will be found to prevail among its separate branches 
the view which leads to the rejection of one ought if con 
sistent to lead to the rejection of others and indeed many 
of the authorities which have been quoted against the study 
of mathematics are even more explicit in their condemnation of 
logic natural science says the chian aristo is above us 
logical science does not concern us when such conclusions 
are founded as they often are upon a deep conviction of the 
preeminent value and importance of the study of morals we 
admit the premises but must demur to the inference for it 
has been well said by an ancient writer that it is the charac 
teristic of the liberal sciences not that they conduct us to virtue 
but that they prepare us for virtue and melancthons senti 
ment abeunt studia in mores has passed into a proverb 
moreover there is a common ground upon which all sincere 
votaries of truth may meet exchanging with each other the 
language of flamsteeds appeal to newton the works of the 
eternal providence will be better understood through your 
labors and mine 



 



first principles 



let us employ the symbol or unity to represent the 
universe and let us understand it as comprehending every 
conceivable class of objects whether actually existing or not 
it being premised that the same individual may be found in 
more than one class inasmuch as it may possess more than one 
quality in common with other individuals let us employ the 
letters x y z to represent the individual members of classes 
x applying to every member of one class as members of that 
particular class and y to every member of another class as 
members of such class and so on according to the received lan 
guage of treatises on logic 

further let us conceive a class of symbols x y z possessed 
of the following character 

the symbol x operating upon any subject comprehending 
individuals or classes shall be supposed to select from that 
siibject all the xs which it contains in like manner the symbol 
y operating upon any subject shall be supposed to select from 
it all individuals of the class y which are comprised in it and 
so on 

when no subject is expressed we shall suppose the uni 
verse to be the subject understood so that we shall have 

x x 

the meaning of either term being the selection from the universe 
of all the xs which it contains and the result of the operation 



 first principllis 

being in common language the class x i e the class of which 
each member is an x 

from these premises it will follow that the product xy will 
represent in succession the selection of the class y and the 
selection from the class y of such individuals of the class x as 
are contained in it the result being the class whose members are 
both xs and ys and in like manner the product xyz will 
represent a compound operation of which the successive ele 
ments are the selection of the class z the selection from it of 
such individuals of the class y as are contained in it and the 
selection from the result thus obtained of all the individuals of 
the class x which it contains the final result being the class 
common to x y and z 

from the nature of the operation which the symbols x y z 
are conceived to represent we shall designate them as elective 
symbols an expression in which they are involved will be 
called an elective function and an equation of which the mem 
bers are elective functions will be termed an elective equation 

it will not be necessary that we should here enter into the 
analysis of that mental operation which we have represented by 
the elective symbol it is not an aqt of abstraction according 
to the common acceptation of that term because we never lose 
sight of the concrete but it may probably be referred to an ex 
ercise of the faculties of comparison and attention our present 
concern is rather with the laws of combination and of succession 
by which its results are governed and of these it will suffice to 
notice the following 

st the result of an act of election is independent of the 
grouping or classification of the subject 

thus it is indiflferent whether from a group of objects con 
sidered as a whole we select the class x or whether we divide 
the group into two parts select the xs from them separately 
and then connect the results in one aggregate conception 

we may express this law mathematically by the equation 

x u • v xu xv 



first principles it 

u i v representing the undivided subject and it and v the 
component parts of it 

nd it is indifferent in what order two successive acts of 
election are performed 

avhether from the class of animals we select sheep and from 
the sheep those which are horned or whether from the class of 
animals we select the horned and from these such as are sheep 
the result is unaffected in either case we arrive at the class 
horned sheep 

the symbolical expression of this law is 

rd the result of a given act of election performed twice 
or any number of times in succession is the result of the same 
act performed once 

if from a group of objects we select the xs we obtain a class 
of which all the members are xs if we repeat the operation 
on this class no further change will ensue in selecting the xs 
we take the whole thus we have 

xx — x 

or x 

and supposing the same operation to be n times performed we 
have 

which is the mathematical expression of the law above stated 
the laws we have established under the symbolical forms 

x u r c xu ¦¥ xv i 

xy yx 

xx 

 the oflfice of the elective symbol x is to select individuals comprehended 
in the class x let the class x be supposed to embrace the universe then 
whatever the class y may be we have 

xy y 
the office which x performs is now equivalent to the symbol in one at 
least of its interpretations and the index law gives 

 
which is the known property of that symbol 



 



fikst principles 



are suflicient for tlie basis of a calculus from the first of these 
it appears that elective symbols are dislibulive from the second 
that they are comnutcuke properties which they possess in 
common with symbols of quantity and in virtue of which all 
the processes of common algebra are applicable to the present 
system the one and sufficient axiom involved in this appli 
cation is that equivalent operations performed upon equivalent 
subjects produce equivalent results 

the third law we shall denominate the index law it is 
peculiar to elective symbols and will be found of great impor 
tance in enabling us to reduce our results to forms meet for 
interpretation 

from the circumstance that the processes of algebra may be 
applied to the present system it is not to be inferred that the 
interpretation of an elective equation will be unaffected by such 
processes the expression of a truth cannot be negatived by 

 it is generally asserted by writers on logic that all reasoning ultimately 
depends on an application of tlie dictum of aristotle de omni et ntillo what 
ever is predicated universally of any class of things may be predicated in like 
manner of any thing comprehended in that class but it is agreed that this 
dictum is not immediately applicable in all cases and that in a majority of 
instances a certain previous process of reduction is necessary what are the 
elements involved in that process of reduction clearly they are as much 
a part of general reasoning as the dictum itself 

another mode of considering the subject resolves all reasoning into an appli 
cation of one or other of the following canons viz 

 if two terms agree with one and the same third they agree with each 
other 

 if one term agrees and another disagrees with one and the same third 
these two disagree with each other 

but the application of these canons depends on mental acts equivalent to 
those which are involved in the beforenamed process of reduction we have to 
select individuals from classes to convert propositions c before we can avail 
ourselves of their guidance any accoimt of the process of reasoning is insuffi 
cient which does not represent as well the laws of the operation which the 
mind performs in that process as the primary truths which it recognises and 
applies 

it is presumed that the laws in question are adequately represented by the 
fundamental equations of the present calculus the proof of this will be found 
in its capability of expressing propositions and of exhibiting in the results of 
its processes every result that may be arrived at by ordinary reasoning 



first principles 

a legitimate operation but it may be limited the equation 
y z implies that the classes y and z are equivalent member 
for member multiply it by a factor x and we have 

xy xz 

which expresses that the individuals which are common to the 
classes x and y are also common to x and z and vice verscl 
this is a perfectly legitimate inference but the fact which it 
declares is a less general one than was asserted in the original 
proposition 



 



of expression and interpretation 



a proposition is a sentence which either affirms or denies as all men are 
mortal no creature is independent 

a proposition has necessarily two terms as wew mortal the former of which 
or the one spoken of is called the subject the latter or that which is affirmed 
or denied of the subject the predicate these are connected together by the 
copula is or is not or by some other modification of the substantive verb 

the substantive verb is the only verb recognised in logic all others are 
resolvable by means of the verb to be and a participle or adjective e g • the 
romans conquered the word conquered is both copula and predicate being 
equivalent to were copula victorious predicate 

a proposition must either be affirmative or negative and must be also either 
imiversal or particular thus we reckon in all four kinds of pure categorical 
propositions 

st universal affirmative usually represented by a 

ex all xs are ys 
nd universalnegative usually represented by e 

ex no xs are ys 
rd particular affirmative usually represented by i 

eiii some xs are ys 
th particularnegative usually represented by o 
ex some xs are not ys 

 to express the class notx that is the class including 
all individuals that are not xs 

the class x and the class notx together make the universe 
but the universe is and the class x is determined by the 
symbol x therefore the class notx will be determined by 
the symbol x 

 the above is taken with little variation from the treatises of aldrich 
and whately 



of expression and interpretation 

hence the office of the symbol i x attached to a given 
subject will be to select from it all the notxs which it 
contains 

and in like manner as the product xy expresses the entire 
class whose members are both xs and ys the symbol y x 
will represent the class whose members are ys but not xs 
and the symbol xl y the entire class whose members 
are neither xs nor ys 

 to express the proposition all xs are ys 

as all the xs which exist are found in the class y it is 
obvious that to select out of the universe all ys and from 
these to select all xs is the same as to select at once from the 
universe all xs 

hence xy x 

or xl y 

 to express the proposition no xs are ys 

to assert that no xs are ys is the same as to assert that 
there are no terms common to the classes x and y now 
all individuals common to those classes are represented by xy 
hence the proposition that no xs are ys is represented by 

the equation 

xy 

 to express the proposition some xs are ys 

if some xs are ys there are some terms common to the 

classes x and y let those terms constitute a separate class 

v to which there shall correspond a separate elective symbol 

vy then 

v xy 

and as v includes all terms common to the classes x and y 
we can indifferently interpret it as some xs or some ys 

c 



 of expression and interpretation 

 to express the proposition some xs are not ys 
in the last equation write y for t and we have 

v xiy 

the interpretation of v being indifferently some xs or some 
notys 

the above equations involve the complete theory of cate 
gorical propositions and so far as respects the employment of 
analysis for the deduction of logical inferences nothing more 
can be desired but it may be satisfactory to notice some par 
ticular forms deducible from the third and fourth equations and 
susceptible of similar application 

if we multiply the equation by x we have 

vx xy xy by 
comparing with we find 

v vx 

or vl r 

and multiplying by y and reducing in a similar manner 

we have 

v vy 

or vly 

comparing and 

vx ty vf 

and further comparing and with we have as the 
equivalent of this system of equations the propositions 

all vs are xs 
au vs are ysj 

the system might be used to replace or the single 

equation 

vx vyy 

might be used assigning to vx the interpretation some xs and 
to vy the interpretation some ys but it will be observed that 



on expression and interpretation 

this system does not express quite so much as the single equa 
tion from which it is derived both indeed express the 
proposition some xs are ys but the system flo does not 
imply that the class v includes all the terms that are common 
to x and y 

in like manner from the equation which expresses the 
proposition some xs are not ys we may deduce the system 

vxt y v 

in which the interpretation of t y is some notys since 
in this case vy we must of course be careful not to in 
terpret vy as some ys 

if we multiply the first equation of the system viz 

vxv y 
by y we have 

vxy vy y 

oxy 

which is a form that will occasionally present itself it is not 
necessary to revert to the primitive equation in order to inter 
pret this for the condition that vx represents some xs shews 
us by virtue of that its import will be 

some xs are not ys 

the subject comprising all the xs that are found in the class v 

universally in these cases diflference of fokm implies a dif 
ference of interpretation with respect to the auxiliary symbol v 
and each form is interpretable by itself 

further these differences do not introduce into the calculus 
a needless perplexity it will hereafter be seen that they give 
a precision and a definiteness to its conclusions which could not 
otherwise be secured 

finally we may remark that all the equations by which 
particular truths are expressed are deducible from any one 
general equation expressing any one general proposition from 
which those particular propositions are necessary deductions 



 of expression and interpretation 

this has been partially shewn already but it is much more fully 
exemplified in the following scheme 

the general equation y 

implies that the classes x and y are equivalent member for 
member that every individual belonging to the one belongs 
to the other also multiply the equation by xy and we have 

 xxy 

which implies by that all xs are ys multiply the same 
equation by y and we have in like manner 

y xy 

the import of which is that all ys are xs take either of these 
equations the latter for instance and writing it under the form 

 

we may regard it as an equation in which y an unknown 
quantity is sought to be expressed in terms of x now it 
will be shewn when we come to treat of the solution of elective 
equations and the result may here be verified by substitution 
that the most general solution of this equation is 

y vx 

which implies that all ys are xs and that some xs are ys 
multiply by x and we have 

vy vxf 

which indiflferently implies that some ys are xs and some xs 
are ys being the particular form at which we before arrived 

for convenience of reference the above and some other 
results have been classified in the annexed table the first 
column of which contains propositions the second equations 
and the third the conditions of final interpretation it is to 
be observed that the auxiliary equations which are given in 
this column are not independent they are implied either 
in the equations of the second column or in the condition for 



of expression and interpretation 



 



the interpretation of v but it has been thought better to write 
them separately for greater ease and convenience and it is 
further to be borne in mind that although three different forms 
are given for the expression of each of the particular proposi 
tions everything is really included in the first form

of the conversion of propositions 



a proposition is said to be converted wlien its terms are transposed when 
nothing more is done this is called simple conversion eg 
no virtuous man is a tyrant is converted into 
no tyrant is a virtuous man 
logicians also recognise conversion per accidens or by limitation egi 
all birds are animals is converted into 
some animals are birds 
and conversion by contraposition or negation as 

every poet is a man of genius converted into 
he who is not a man of genius is not a poet 
in one of these three ways every proposition may be ulatively converted viz 
e and i simply a and o by negation a and e by limitation 

the primary canonical forms already determined for the 
expression of propositions are 

all xs are ys a i y a 

no xs are ys xy e 

some xs are ys v xt i 

some xs are not ys v x i y 

on examining these we perceive that e and i are sym 
metrical with respect to x and y so that x being changed into y 
and y into x the equations remain unchanged hence e and i 
may be interpreted into 

no ys are xs 
some ys are xs 

respectively thus we have the known rule of the logicians 
that particular affirmative and universal negative propositions 
admit of simple conversion 



of the conversion of propositions 

the equations a and o may be written in the forms 

lyllx 

v lyllx 

now these are precisely the forms which we should have 

obtained if we had in those equations changed x into i y 

and y into which would have represented the changing 

in the original propositions of the xs into notys and the 

ys into notxs the resulting propositions being 

all notys are notxs 

some notys are not notxs a 

or we may by simply inverting the order of the factors in the 

second member of and writing it in the form 

v l yx 
interpret it by i into 

some notys are xs 

which is really another form of a hence follows the rule 
that universal affirmative and particular negative propositions 
admit of negative conversion or as it is also termed conversion 
by contraposition 

the equations a and e written in the forms 

lyx 

yx oy 

give on solution the respective forms 

x vy 

x v y 

the correctness of which may be shewn by substituting these 
values of x in the equations to which they belong and observing 
that those equations are satisfied quite independently of the nature 
of the symbol v the first solution may be interpreted into 

some ys are xs 
and the second into 

some notys are xs 



o of the conversion of propositions 

from which it appears that universalaffirmative and universal 
negative propositions are convertible by limitation or as it has 
been termed per accidens 

the above are the laws of conversion recognized by abp 
whately writers differ however as to the admissibility of 
negative conversion the question depends on whether we will 
consent to use such terms as notx noty agreeing with 
those who tliink that such terms ought to be admitted even 
although they change the kind of the proposition i am con 
strained to observe that the present classification of them is 
faulty and defective thus the conversion of no xs are ys 
into all ys are notxs though perfectly legitimate is not re 
cognised in the above scheme it may therefore be proper to 
examine the subject somewhat more fully 

should we endeavour from the system of equations we have 
obtained to deduce the laws not only of the conversion but 
also of the general transformation of propositions we should be 
led to recognise the following distinct elements each connected 
with a distinct mathematical process 

st the negation of a term i e the changing of x into notx 
or notx into x 

nd the translation of a proposition from one kind to 
another as if we should change 

all xs are ys into some xs are ys a into i 
which would be lawful or 

all xs are ys into no xs are y a into e 
which would be unlawful 

rd the simple conversion of a proposition 

the conditions in obedience to which these processes may 
lawfully be performed may be deduced from the equations by 
which propositions are expressed 

we have 

all xs are ys x y a 

no xs are ys xy e 



of the conversion of pkopositions 

write e in the form 

x ly 

and it is interpretable by a into 

all xs are notys 

so that we may change 

no xs are ys into all xs are notys 

in like manner a interpreted by e gives 

no xs are notys 

so that we may change 

all xs are ys into no xs are notys 

from these cases we have the following rule a universal 
affirmative proposition is convertible into a universalnegative 
and vice versd by negation of the predicate 

again we have 

some xs are ys v xy 

some xs are not ys a y 

these equations only diifer from those last considered by the 
presence of the term v the same reasoning therefore applies 
and we have the rule — 

a particularaffirmative proposition is convertible into a par 
ticularnegative and vice cersd by negation of the predicate 

assuming the universal propositions 

all xs are ys x i y 

no xs are ys xy 

multiplying by v we find 

vxly 

vxy 
which are interpretable into 

some xs are ys t 

some xs are not ys 



 of the conversion of propositions 

hence a universalaffirmative is convertible into a particular 
affirmative and a universalnegative into a particularnegative 
without negation of subject or predicate 

combining the above with the already proved rule of simple 
conversion we arrive at the following system of independent 
laws of transformation 

st an affirmative proposition may be changed into its cor 
responding negative a into e or i into o and vice versa 
by negation of the predicate 

nd a universal proposition may be changed into its corre 
sponding particular proposition a into i or e into o 

rd in a particularaffirmative or universalnegative propo 
sition the terms may be mutually converted 

wherein negation of a term is the changing of x into notx 
and vice versa and is not to be understood as affecting the hind 
of the proposition 

every lawful transformation is reducible to the above rules 
thus we have 

all xs are ys 

no xs are notys by st rule 
no notys are xs by rd rule 
all notys are notxs by st rule 
which is an example of negative conversion again 
no xs are ys 

no ys are xs rd rule 

all ys are notxs st rule 
which is the case already deduced 



 



of syllogisms 



a syllogism consists of three propositions the last of which called the 
conclusion is a logical consequence of the two former called the premises 
eg 

„ ah ys axe xs 

premises „ at 

all zs are ys 

conclusioi all zs are xs 

every syllogism has three and only three terms whereof that which is 
the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term the predicate of the 
conclusion the major term and the remaining term common to both premises 
the middle term thus in ths above formula z is the minor term x the 
major term y the middle term 

the figure of a syllogism consists in the situation of the middle term with 
respect to the terms of the conclusion the varieties of figure are exhibited 
in the annexed scheme

nd fig 


rl fig

when we designate the three propositions of a syllogism by their usual 
symbols e i o and in their actual order we are said to determine 
the mood of the syllogism thus the syllogism given above by way of 
illustration belongs to the mood aaa in the first figure 

the moods of all syllogisms commonly received as valid are represented 
by the vowels in the following mnemonic verses 

fig — barbara celarent darll ferlo que prroris 
fig — cesare camestres festino baroko secunda 
fig — tertia daraptl disamis datlsi felapton 

bokardo ferlso habet quarta insuper addit 
fig — bramantip camenes dlniarls fesapo fresison 

tife equation by which we express any proposition con 
cerning the classes x and y is an equation between the 
symbols x and y and the equation by which we express any 



s of syllogisms 

proposition conoerning the classes y and z is an equation 
between the symbols y and z if from two such equations 
we eliminate y the result if it do not vanish will be an 
equation between x and z and will bo interpretable into a 
proposition concerning the classes x and z and it will then 
constitute the third member or conclusion of a syllogism 
of which the two given propositions are the premises 

the result of the elimination of y from the equations 

tlr 

ay b 

is the equation ab ab 

now the equations of propositions being of the first order 
with reference to each of the variables involved all the cases 
of elimination which we shall have to consider will be re 
ducible to the above case the constants j a b being 
replaced by functions of x z and the auxiliary symbol t 

as to the choice of equations for the expression of our 
premises the only restriction is that the equations must not 
both be of the form ay for in such cases elimination would 
be impossible when both equations are of this form it is 
necessary to solve one of them and it is indiiferent which 
we choose for this purpose if that which we select is of 
the form xt its solution is 

y vlx 

if of the form i x y the solution will be 

yvx 

and these are the only cases which can arise the reason 
of this exception will appear in the sequel 

for the sake of uniformity we shall in the expression of 
particular propositions confine ourselves to the forms 

vx vy some xs are ys 

vx i y some xs are not ys 



of syllogisms 

these have a closer analogy with and than the other 
forms which might be used 

between the forms about to be developed and the aristotelian 
canons some points of difference will occasionally be observed 
of which it may be proper to forewarn the reader 

to the right understanding of these it is proper to remark 
that the essential structure of a syllogism is in some measure 
arbitrary supposing the order of the premises to be fixed 
and the distinction of the major and the minor term to be 
thereby determined it is purely a matter of choice which of 
the two shall have precedence in the conclusion logicians 
have settled this question in favour of the minor term but 
it is clear that this is a convention had it been agreed 
that the major term should have the first place in the con 
clusion a logical scheme might have been constructed less 
convenient in some cases than the existing one but superior 
in others what it lost in harhara it would gain in hramantip 
convenience is perhaps in favour of the adopted arrangement 
but it is to be remembered that it is merely an arrangement 

now the method we shall exhibit not having reference 
to one scheme of arrangement more than to another will 
always give the more general conclusion regard being paid 
only to its abstract lawfulness considered as a result of pure 
reasoning and therefore we shall sometimes have presented 
to us the spectacle of conclusions which a logician would 
pronounce informal but never of such as a reasoning being 
would account false 

the aristotelian canons however beside restricting the orde 
of the terms of a conclusion limit their nature also — and 
this limitation is of more consequence than the former we 
baay by a change of figure replace the particular conclusion 

 the contrary view was maintained by hobbes the question is very 
faxay discussed in hallams introdtiction to the literature of europe vol iii 
p in the rhetorical use of syllogism the advantage appears to rest 
with the rejected form 



 on syllogisms 

of hramantip by the general conclusion of harhara but we 
cannot thus reduce to rule such inferences as 

some notxs are not ys 

yet there are cases in which such inferences may lawfully 
be drawn and in unrestricted argument they are of frequent 
occurrence now if an inference of this or of any other 
kind is lawful in itself it will be exhibited in the results 
of our method 

we may by restricting the canon of interpretation confine 
our expressed results within the limits of the scholastic logic 
but this would only be to restrict ourselves to the use of a part 
of the conclusions to which oiu analysis entitles us 

the classification we shall adopt will be purely mathematical 
and we shall afterwards consider the logical arrangement to 
which it corresponds it will be sufficient for reference to 
name the premises and the figure in which they are found

eliminating y by we have

 all zs are xs 

a convenient mode of effecting the elimination is to write 
the equation of the premises so that y shall appear only as 
a factor of one member in the first equation and only as 
a factor of the opposite member in the second equation and 
then to multiply the equations omitting the y this method 
we shall adopt

the reason why we cannot interpret vzx into some zs

the interpretation of vx is fixed as some xs v is regarded 
as the representative of some only with reference to the 
class x 

 we say directly or indirectly mutation or conversion of premises being 
in some instances required tlins ae fig is resolvable by fesapo fig 
or by ferio fig aristotle and his followers rejected the fourth figure 
as only a modification of the first but this being a mere question of form 
either scheme may be termed aristotelian 



 of syllggtsms 

for the reason of our employing a solution of one of the 
primitive equations see the remarks on and had 
we solved the second equation instead of the first we should 
have had 

 

vlz y 

vz lr b 

 some notzs are xs 

here it is to be observed that the second equation a fixes 
the meaning of vl z as some notzs the full meaning 
of the result b is that all the notzs which are found in 
the class y are found in the class x and it is evident that 
this could not have been expressed in any other way 

ex aa fig

had we solved the second equation we should have had 
as our result some zs are xs the form of the final equation 
particularizes what xs or what zs are referred to and this 
remark is general

examples — 

ao fig and by mutation oa fig

vilzlx b 
 
since the auxiliary equation in this case is v z 

practically it is not necessary to perform this reduction but 
it is satisfactory to do so the equation a it is seen defines 
vz as some zs but it does not define vl z so that we might 
stop at the result of elimination h and content ourselves with 
saying that it is not interpretable into a relation between the 
classes x and z 

take as a second example ai fig and by mutation

the auxiliary equation in this case being vl z 

indeed in every case in this class in which no inference 
is possible the result of elimination is reducible to the form 
 examples therefore need not be multiplied 

class th — when v enters into both equations 

no inference is possible in any case but there exists a dis 
tinction among the unlawful cases which is peculiar to this 
class the two divisions are

auxiliary equations to the form the cases are ii

let us take as an example of the former case ii fig 
some xs are ys vx vy vx vy 

some zs are ys vz vy vy vz 

vvx vvz 

now the auxiliary equations vl x v i z 

give vx v vz v 

substituting we have 

vv vv 

 o 

as an example of the latter case let us take fig 

some ys are xs vy vxy vy vx 

some zs are not ys vz v i y v z vy 



vv z wx 

now the auxiliary equations being vl x v z q 
the above reduces to vv it is to this form that all similar 
cases are reducible its interpretation is that the classes v 
and v have no common member as is indeed evident 

the above classification is purely founded on mathematical 
distinctions we shall now inquire what is thd logical division 
to which it corresponds 

the lawful cases of the first class comprehend all those in 
which from two universal premises a universal conclusion 
may be drawn we see that they include the premises of 
harhara and celarent in the first figure of cesare and camestrcs 
in the second and of bramantij and camenes in the fourth 



 of syllogisms 

the premises oi hramantip are included because they admit 
of an universal conclusion although not in the same figure 

the lawful cases of the second class are those in which 
a particular conclusion only is deducible from two universal 
premises 

the lawful cases of the third class are those in which a 
conclusion is deducible from two premises one of which is 
universal and the other particular 

the fourth class has no lawful cases 

among the cases in which no inference of any kind is pos 
sible we find six in the fourth class distinguishable from the 
others by the circumstance that the result of elimination does 
not assume the form the cases are 

some ys are xs fsome ys are not xs fsome xs are ys i 
some zs are not yj some zs are not ys j some zs are not ysj 

and the three others which are obtained by mutation of 
premises 

it might be presumed that some logical peculiarity would 
be found to answer to the mathematical peculiarity which we 
have noticed and in fact there exists a very remarkable one 
if we examine each pair of premises in the above scheme we 
shall find that there is virtually no middle term i e io meditem 
of comparison in any of them thus in the first example 
the individuals spoken of in the first premiss are asserted to 
belong to the class y but those spoken of in the second 
premiss are virtually asserted to belong to the class noty 
nor can we by any lawful transformation or conversion alter 
this state of things the comparison will still be made with 
the class y in one premiss and with the class noty in the 
other 

now in every case beside the above six there will be found 
a middle term either expressed or implied i select two 
of the most difficult cases 



of syllogisms 

in ao fig viz 

all ys are xs 
some zs are not ys 

we have by negative conversion of the first premiss 

all notxs are notys 
some zs are not ys 

and the middle term is now seen to be noty 

again in eo fig 

 no ys are xs 
some zs are not ys 

a proved conversion of the first premiss see conversion of 
propositions f gives 

all xs are notys 

some zs are notys 

and the middle term the true medium of comparison is plainly 
noty although as the notys in the one premiss may he 
diflferent from those in the other no conclusion can be drawn 

the mathematical condition in question therefore — the irre 
ducibility of the final equation to the form — adequately 
represents the logical condition of there being no middle term 
or common medium of comparison in the given premises 

i am not aware that the distinction occasioned by the 
presence or absence of a middle term in the strict sense here 
understood has been noticed by logicians before the dis 
tinction though real and deserving attention is indeed by 
no means an obvious one and it would have been unnoticed 
in the present instance but for the peculiarity of its mathe 
matical expression 

what appears to be novel in the above case is the proof 
of the existence of combinations of premises in which there 



 of syllogisms 

is absolutely no medium of comparison when such a medium 
of comparison or true middle term does exist the condition 
that its quantification in both premises together shall ex 
ceed its quantification as a single whole has been ably and 
clearly shewn by professor de morgan to be necessary to 
lawful inference cambridge memoirs vol viii part and 
this is undoubtedly the true principle of the syllogism viewed 
from the standingpoint of arithmetic 

i have said that it would be possible to impose conditions 
of interpretation which should restrict the results of this cal 
culus to the aristotelian forms those conditions would be 

st that we should agree not to interpret the forms vx 
vl z 

ndly that we should agree to reject every interpretation in 
which the order of the terms should violate the aristotelian rule 

or instead of the second condition it might be agreed that 
the conclusion being determined the order of the premises 
should if necessary be changed so as to make the syllogism 
formal 

from the general character of the system it is indeed plain 
that it may be made to represent any conceivable scheme of 
logic by imposing the conditions proper to the case con 
templated 

we have found it in a certain class of cases to be necessary 
to replace the two equations expressive of universal propo 
sitions by their solutions and it may be proper to remark 
that it would have been allowable in all instances to have 
done this so that every case of the syllogism without ex 

 it may be satisfactory to illustrate this statement by an example in 
barbara we should have 

all ys are xs y vx 

all zs are ys z —vy 

z wx 
 all zs are xs 



of syllogisms 

ception might have been treated by equations comprised in 
the general forms 

y vx or y ra a 

y v xf or y a t e 

vy vx vy vx i 

vy vx vy vx v o 

or we may multiply the resulting equation by — a which gives 

whence the same conclusion all zs are xs 

some additional examples of the application of the system of equations in 
the text to the demonstration of general theorems may not be inappropriate 

let y be the term to be eliminated and let x stand indifferently for either of 
the other symbols then each of the equations of the premises of any given 
syllogism may be put in the form 

ay bx a 
if the premiss is affirmative and in the form 

ay b i x 

if it is negative a and b beiag either constant or of the form ± v to prove 
this in detail let us examine each kind of proposition making y successively 
subject and predicate

of syllogisms 



perhaps the system we have actually employed is better 
as distinguishing the cases in which o only may be employed 

and eliminating y q 

which is of the form a hence if there is a conclusion it is affirmative 

nd a conclusion draton from an affirmative and a negative proposition is 
negative 

by a and we have for the given propositions 

ay bx — 
ay r 

 abx — ab — z 

which is of the form hence the conclusion if there is one is negative 

rd a conclusion drawn from two negative premises will involve a negation 
not notz in both subject and predicate and will therefore be inadmissible in 
the aristotelian system though just in itself 
for the premises beiag 

ay — a 
ay r 
the conclusion will be 

ab i z ab a 

which is only interpretable into a proposition that has a negation in each term 

th taking into account those syllogisms only in which the conclusion is the 
most general that can be deduced from the premises — if in an aristotelian 
syllogism the minor premises be changed in quality from affirmative to negative 
or from negative to affirmative whether it be changed in quantity or not no con 
clusion will be deducible in the same figure 

an aristotelian proposition does not admit a term of the form notz in the 
subject — now on changing the quantity of the minor proposition of a syllogism 
we transfer it from the general form 

ay bz — 
to the general form ay 

see a and or vice versd and therefore in the equation of the conclusion 
there will be a change from z to — or vice versa but this is equivalent to 
the change of z into notz or notz into z now the subject of the original 
conclusion must have involved a z and not a notz therefore the subject of the 
new conclusion will involve a notz and the conclusion avill not be admissible 
in the aristotelian forms except by conversion which would render necessary 
a change of figure 

now the conclusions of this calculus are always the most general that can be 
drawn and therefore the above demonstration must not be supposed to extend 
to a syllogism in which a particular conclusion is deduced when a imiversal 
one is possible this is the case with bramantip only among the aristotelian 
forms and therefore the transformation of bramantip into eamenes and vice versd 
is the case of restriction contemplated in the preliminary statement of the 
theorem 



of syllogisms 

from those in which it must but for the demonstration of 
certain general properties of the syllogism the above system 
is from its simplicity and from the mutual analogy of its 
forms very convenient we shall apply it to the following 
theorem 

given the three propositions of a syllogism prove that there 
is but one order in which they can be legitimately arranged 
and determine that order 

all the forms above given for the expression of propositions 
are particular cases of the general form 

a •hx cy q 

th if for the minor premiss of an aristotelian syllogism we sitbstittfte its con 
tradictory no conclusion is deducihle in the same figure 

it is here only necessary to examine the case of bramaniip all the others 
being determined by the last proposition 

on changing the minor of hramantip to its contradictory we haye ao 
fig and this admits of no legitimate inference 

• hence the theorem is true without exception many other general theorems 
may in like manner be proved 

 this elegant theorem was communicated by the rev charles graves 
fellow and professor of mathematics in trinity college dublin to whom the 
author desires further to record his grateful acknowledgments for a very 
judicious examination of the former portion of this work and for some new 
applications of the method the following example of reduction ad impossibile 
is among the number 

reducend mood all xs are ys — y u — r 

baroko some zs are not ys vz v i — y 

some zs are not xs vz vv x — x 

reduct mood all xs are ys y v — x 

barbara all zs are xs a a 

all zs are ys y 

the conclusion of the reduct mood is seen to be the contradictory of the 
suppressed minor premiss whence c it may just be remarked that the 
mathematical test of contradictory propositions is that on eliminating one 
elective symbol between their equations the other elective symbol vanishes 
the ostensive reduction of baroko and bokardo involves no difficulty 
 professor graves suggests the employment of the equation x vy for the 
primary expression of the proposition all xs are ys and remarks that on 
multiplying both members by y we obtain r — y the equation from 
which we set out in the text and of which the previous one is a solution 



 of syllogisms 

assume then for the premises of the given syllogism the 

equations 

a bx cy 

a bz cy 

then eliminating y we shall have for the conclusion 

ac ac bcx bcz 

now taking this as one of our premises and either of the 
original equations suppose as the other if by elimination 
of a common term ar between them we can obtain a result 
equivalent to the remaining premiss it will appear that 
there are more than one order in which the propositions may 
be lawfully written but if otherwise one arrangement only 
is lawful 

eflfecting then the elimination we have 

be a bz cy 

which is equivalent to multiplied by a factor be now on 
examining the value of this factor in the equations a e i o 
we find it in each case to be t or v but it is evident 
that if an equation expressing a given proposition be mul 
tiplied by an extraneous factor derived from another equa 
tion its interpretation will either be limited or rendered 
impossible thus there will either be no result at all or the 
result will be a limitation of the remaining proposition 

if however one of the original equations were 
x y or xy 

the factor be would be and would not limit the interpret 
ation of the other premiss hence if the first member of 
a syllogism should be understood to represent the double 
proposition all xs are ys and all ys are xs it would be 
indifferent in what order the remaining propositions were 
written 



of syllogisms t 

a more general form of the above investigation would be 
to express the premises by the equations 

a hx cy dxy 
a hz cy dzy 

after the double elimination of y and x we should find 

he ad a hz cy dzy 

and it would be seen that the factor he ad must in every 
case either vanish or express a limitation of meaning 

the determination of the order of the propositions is suf 
ficiently obvious 



 



of hypotheticals 



a hypothetical proposition is defined to be two or more categwicals united by 
a copula or conjunction and the different kinds of hypothetical propositions 
are named from their respective conjimctions viz conditional if disjimctive 
either or c 

in conditionals that categorical proposition from which the other results 
is called the antecedent that which results from it the consequent 

of the conditional syllogism there are two and only two formulae 

ist the constructive 

if a is b then c is d 

but a is b therefore c is d 

nd the destructive 

if a is b then c is d 

but c is not d therefore a is not b 

a dilemma is a complex conditional syllogism with several antecedents 
in the major and a disjunctive minor 



if we examine either of the forms of conditional syllogism 

above given we shall see that the validity of the argument 

does not depend upon any considerations which have reference 

to the terms a b c d considered as the representatives 

of individuals or of classes we may in fact represent the 

propositions a is b c is d by the arbitrary symbols x and y 

respectively and express our syllogisms in such forms as the 

following 

if x is true then y is true 

but x is true therefore y is true 

thus what we have to consider is not objects and classes 
of objects but the truths of propositions namely of those 



of hypotheticals 

elementary propositions which are embodied in the tenns of 
our hypothetical premises 

to the symbols x y z representative of propositions we 
may appropriate the elective symbols x y z in the following 
sense 

the hypothetical universe shall comprehend all conceiv 
able cases and conjunctures of circumstances 

the elective symbol x attached to any subject expressive of 
such cases shall select those cases in which the proposition x 
is true and similarly for y and z 

if we confine ourselves to the contemplation of a given pro 
position x and hold in abeyance every other consideration 
then two cases only are conceivable viz first that the given 
proposition is true and secondly that it is false as these 
cases together make up the universe of the proposition and 
as the former is determined by the elective symbol r the latter 
is determined by the symbol i x 

but if other considerations are admitted each of these cases 
will be resolvable into others individually less extensive the 

 it was upon the obvious principle that a proposition is either true or false 
that the stoics applying it to assertions respecting future events endeavoured 
to establish the doctrine of fate it has been replied to their argument that it 
involves an abuse of the word trxte the precise meaning of which is id quod 
res est an assertion respecting the future is neither true nor false — copleston 
on necessity and predestination p were the stoic axiom however pre 
sented under the form it is either certain that a given event will take place 
or certain that it will not the above reply would fail to meet the difficulty 
the proper answer would be that no merely verbal definition can settle the 
question what is the actual course and constitution of nature when we 
affirm that it is either certain that an event will take place or certain that 
it will not take place we tacitly assimie that the order of events is necessary 
that the future is but an evolution of the present so that the state of things 
which is completely determines that which shall be but this at least as re 
spects the conduct of moral agents is the very question at issue exhibited 
under its proper form the stoic reasoning does not involve an abuse of terms 
but a petitio principii 

it shoidd be added that enlightened advocates of the doctrine of necessity 
in the present day viewing the end as appointed only in and through the 
means justly repudiate those practical iu consequences which are the reproach 
of fatalism 



 on hypotheticals 

number of which will depend upon the number of foreign con 
siderations admitted thus if we associate the propositions x 
and y the total number of conceivable cases will be found as 
exhibited in the following scheme 

cases elective expressions 

st x true y true xy 

nd x true y false x y 

rd x false y true x y 

th x false y false ixly 

if we add the elective expressions for the two first of the 
above cases the sum is x which is the elective symbol appro 
priate to the more general case of x being true independently 
of any consideration of y j and if we add the elective expres 
sions in the two last cases together the result is x which 
is the elective expression appropriate to the more general case 
of x being false 

thus the extent of the hypothetical universe does not at 
all depend upon the number of circumstances which are taken 
into account and it is to be noted that however few or many 
those circumstances may be the sum of the elective expressions 
representing every conceivable case will be unity thus let 
us consider the three propositions x it rains y it hails 
z it freezes the possible cases are the following 

cases elective expressions 

st it rains hails and freezes xyz 

nd it rains and hails but does not freeze xy z 

rd it rains and freezes but does not hail xz y 

th it freezes and hails but does not rain yz x 

th it rains but neither hails nor freezes x i yl z 

th it hails but neither rains nor freezes y i x i z 

th it freezes but neither hails nor rains z i xl y 

th it neither rains haik nor freezes i xl yl z

expression of hypothetical propositiois 

to express that a given proposition x is true 

the symbol i x selects those cases in which the proposi 
tion x is false but if the proposition is true there are no 
such cases in its hypothetical universe therefore 

 a 
or x i 

to express that a given proposition x is false 

the elective symbol x selects all those cases in which the 
proposition is true and therefore if the proposition is false 

a 

and in every case having determined the elective expression 
appropriate to a given proposition we assert the truth of that 
proposition by equating the elective expression to unity and 
its falsehood by equating the same expression to 

to express that two propositions x and y are simulta 
neously true 

the elective symbol appropriate to this case is xy therefore 

the equation sought is 

xy 

to express that two propositions x and y are simultaneously 
false 

the condition will obviously be 

lly 
or x ¦ y xy 

to express that either the proposition x is true or the 
proposition y is true 

to assert that either one or the other of two propositions 
is true is to assert that it is not true that they are both false 
now the elective expression appropriate to their both being 
false is ir y therefore the equation required is 

 rr y 

or x y xy i 



 of hypotheticals 

and by indirect considerations of this kind may every dis 
junctive proposition however numerous its members be ex 
pressed but the following general rule will usually be 
preferable 

rule consider what are those distinct and mutually exclusive 
cases of which it is implied in the statement of the ffiven propo 
sition that some one of them is true and equate the sum of their 
elective expressions to unity this will give the equation of the 
given proposition 

for the sum of the elective expressions for all distinct con 
ceivable cases will be unity now all these cases being mutually 
exclusive and it being asserted in the given proposition that 
some one case out of a given set of them is true it follows that 
all which are not included in that set are false and that their 
elective expressions are severally equal to hence the sum 
of the elective expressions for the remaining cases viz those 
included in the given set will be unity some one of those 
cases will therefore be true and as they are mutually exclusive 
it is impossible that more than one should be true whence 
the rule in question 

and in the application of this rule it is to be observed that 
if the cases contemplated in the given disjunctive proposition 
are not mutually exclusive they must be resolved into an equi 
valent series of cases which are mutually exclusive 

thus if we take the proposition of the preceding example 
viz either x is true or y is true and assume that the two 
members of this proposition are not exclusive insomuch that 
in the enumeration of possible cases we must reckon that of 
the propositions x and y being both true then the mutually 
exclusive cases which fill up the universe of the proposition 
with their elective expressions are 

st x true and y false xi y 

nd y true and x false y x 

rd x true and y true xy 



of hypotheticals 

and the sum of these elective expressions equated to unity gives 
x y xy 

as before but if we suppose the members of the disjunctive 
proposition to be exclusive then the only cases to be con 
sidered are 

st x true y false y 

nd y true x false y x 

and the sum of these elective expressions equated to gives 
xxyy 

the subjoined examples will further illustrate this method 

to express the proposition either x is not true or y is not 
true the members being exclusive 

the mutually exclusive cases are 

st x not true y true y x 

nd y not true x true x i y 

and the sum of these equated to unity gives 

xxy y 

which is the same as and in fact the propositions which 
they represent are equivalent 

to express the proposition either x is not true or y is not 
true the members not being exclusive 

to the cases contemplated in the last example we must add 
the following viz 

x not true y not true x y 

the sum of the elective expressions gives 

 y y i y 

ox xy 

to express the disjunctive proposition either x is true or 
y is true or z is true the members being exclusive 

e 



 of hypotheticals 

here the mutually exclusive cases are 

st x true y false z false xl y z 

nd y true z false x false y z x 

rd z true x false y false z x y 

and the sum of the elective expressions equated to gives 
upon reduction 

x y z xy yz zx xyz 

the expression of the same proposition when the members 
are in no sense exclusive will be 

 x y 

and it is easy to see that our method will apply to the 
expression of any similar proposition whose members are 
subject to any specified amount and character of exclusion 

to express the conditional proposition if x is true y 
is true 

here it is implied that all the cases of x being true are 

cases of y being true the former cases being determined 

by the elective symbol x and the latter by y we have in 

virtue of 

xyq 

to express the conditional proposition if x be true y is 
not true 

the equation is obviously 

xy q 

this is equivalent to and in fact the disjunctive proposition 
either x is not true or y is not true and the conditional 
proposition if x is true y is not true are equivalent 

to express that if x is not true y is not true 

in write a for x and i y for y we have 

 y 



of hypothettcals 

the resuhs which we have obtained admit of verification 
in many different ways let it suffice to take for more par 
ticular examination the equation 

 xxy y 

which expresses the conditional proposition either x is true 
or y is true the members being in this case exclusive 

first let the proposition x be true then a and sub 
stituting we have 

 y y y or y 
which implies that y is not true 

secondly let x be not true then x and the equation 
gives y 

which implies that y is true in like manner we may proceed 
with the assumptions that y is true or that y is false 

again in virtue of the property x x y y we may write 
the equation in the form 

x xy y 

and extracting the square root we have 

ic y ± 

and this represents the actual case for as when x is true 
or false y is respectively false or true we have 

x i or 
y or 
 a y or 
there will be no difficulty in the analysis of other cases 

examples of hypothetical syllogism 

the treatment of every form of hypothetical syllogism will 
consist in forming the equations of the premises and eliminatiig 
the symbol or symbols which are found in more than one of 
them the result will express the conclusion

st disjunctive syllogism 

either x is true or y is true exclusive x y xy 
but x is true x i 

therefore y is not true y 

either x is true or y is true not exclusive x y xy 
but x is not true a 

therefore y is true y 

nd constructive conditional syllogism 

if x is true y is true x y 

but x is true a 

therefore y is true y or y

therefore x is not true • a 

th simple constructive dilemma the minor premiss ex 
clusive 

if x is true y is true a y 

if z is true y is true z y 

but either x is true or z is true x ¦• z xz 

from the equations we have to eliminate 
x and z in whatever way we effect this the result is 

whence it appears that the proposition y is true 

th complex constructive dilemma the minor premiss not 
exclusive 

if x is true y is true xl y 

if w is true z is true t 

either x is true or w is true x w xw 

from these equations eliminating z we have 
y r zyzly 



of hypotheticals 

which expresses the conclusion either y is true or z is true 
the members being nonexclusive 

th complex destructive dilemma the minor premiss ex 
clusive 

if x is true y is true a y 

if w is true z is true 

either y is not true or z is not true y z yz 
from these equations we niust eliminate y arid z the 
result is 

which expresses the conclusion either x is not true or y is 
not true the members not being exclusive 

th complex destructive dilemma the minor premiss not 
exclusive 

if x is true y is true x y 

if w is true z is true w zi 

either y is not true or z is not true yz 

on elimination of y and we have 

xw 

which indicates the same conclusion as the previous example 

it appears from these and similar cases that whether the 
members of the minor premiss of a dilemma are exclusive 
or not the members of the disjunctive conclusion are never 
exclusive this fact has perhaps escaped the notice of logicians 

the above are the principal forms of hypothetical syllogism 
which logicians have recognised it would be easy however 
to extend the list especially by the blending of the disjunctive 
and the conditional character in the same proposition of which 
the following is an example 

if x is true then either y is true or z is true 

x y zyz 
but y is not true y 

therefore if x is true z is true x z 



 of hypotheticals 

that which logicians term a causal proposition is properly 
a conditiojial syllogism the major premiss of which is sup 
pressed 

the assertion that the proposition x is true because the 
proposition y is true is equivalent to the assertion 

the proposition y is true 
therefore the proposition x is true 

and these are the minor premiss and conclusion of the con 
ditional syllogism 

if y is true x is true 

but y is true 

therefore x is true 

and thus causal propositions are seen to be included in the 
applications of our general method 

note that there is a family of disjunctive and conditional 
propositions which do not of right belong to the class con 
sidered in this chapter such are those in which the force 
of the disjunctive or conditional particle is expended upon the 
predicate of the proposition as if speaking of the inhabitants 
of a particular island we should say that they are all either 
europeans or asiatics meaning that it is true of each indi 
vidual that he is either a european or an asiatic if we 
appropriate the elective symbol x to the inhabitants y to 
europeans and z to asiatics then the equation of the above 
proposition is 

z xy t xz ov xl y z a 

to which we might add the condition yz since no europeans 
are asiatics the nature of the symbols x y z indicates that 
the proposition belongs to those which we have before de 
signated as categorical very different from the above is the 
proposition either all the inhabitants are europeans or they 
are all asiatics here the disjunctive particle separates pro 
positions the case is that contemplated in of the pre 
sent chapter and the symbols by which it is expressed 



of hypotheticals 

although subject to the same laws as those of a have a totally 
different interpretation 

the distinction is real and important every proposition 
which language can express may be represented by elective 
symbols and the laws of combination of those symbols are in 
all cases the same but in one class of instances the symbols 
have reference to collections of objects in the other to the 
truths of constituent propositions 

 some writers among whom is dr latham first outlines regard it as 
the excltisive office of a conjunction to connect propositions not words in this 
view i am not able to agree the proposition every animal is either rational 
or irrational cannot be resolved into either every animal is rational or every 
animal is irrational the former belongs to pure categoricals the latter to 
hypotheticals in singular propositions such conversions would seem to be 
allowable this animal is either rational or irrational is equivalent to either 
this animal is rational or it is irrational this peculiarity of singular pro 
positions would almost justify our ranking them though trvdy universals in 
a separate class as ramus and his followers did 



 



properties of elective functions 



since elective symbols combine according to the laws of 
quantity we may by maclaurins theorem expand a given 
function x in ascending powers of x known cases of failure 
excepted thus we have 

w x x c 

 

now x x x x c whence 

tx i z y iljp c 
now if in we make a we have 

i oo c 

whence 

substitute this value for the coefficient of x in the second 
member of and we have 

 

 although this and the following theorems have only been proved for those 
forms of functions which are expansible by maclaurins theorem they may be 
regarded as true for all forms whatever this will appear from the applications 
the reason seems to be that as it is only through the one form of expansion 
that elective functions become interpretable no conflicting interpretation is 
possible 

the development of p x may also be determined thus by the known for 
mula for expansion in factorials 

a rf 
a f a x 



pkoperties of elective functions 

which we shall also employ under the form 

x jil r x 

every function of x in which integer powers of that symbol 
are alone involved is by this theorem reducible to the first 
order the quantities we shall call the moduli 
of the function fx they are of great importance in the 
theory of elective functions as will appear from the succeeding 
propositions 

prop any two functions f x p x are equivalent 
whose corresponding moduli are equal 

this is a plain consequence of the last proposition for since 

 l x 

yrx jr¦ ir o r 

it is evident that if o yjr o p the two 

expansions will be equivalent and therefore the functions which 

they represent will be equivalent also 

the converse of this proposition is equally true viz 

if two functions are equivalent their corresponding moduli 
are equal 

among the most important applications of the above theorem 
we may notice the following 

suppose it required to determine for what forms of the 
function x the following equation is satisfied viz 
 xy f x 

now x being an elective symbol x x so that all the terms after the 
second vanish also af — whence 
pactio i x 
the mathematician may be interested in the remark that this is not the 
only case in which an expansion stops at the second term the expansions of 

the compound operative functions i — x j and s j v are 
respectively u

 x ita i 

this result may also be proved by substituting for x 
 w x i their expanded forms and equating the coefficients 
of the resulting equation properly reduced 

all the above theorems may be extended to functions of more 
than one symbol for as different elective symbols combine 
with each other according to the same laws as symbols of quan 
tity we can first expand a given function with reference to any 
particular symbol which it contains and then expand the result 
with reference to any other symbol and so on in succession the 
order of the expansions being quite indifferent 

thus the given function being xy we have 

t y l l xl l xo y 
and expanding the coefficients with reference to x and reducing 
 xy l x f l y 

 l xy 
to which we may give the elegant symmetrical form 
m xl y lolylx 

 lloxlylcnxy 

wherein we shall in accordance with the language already 
employed designate as the 
moduli of the function p xy 

by inspection of the above general form it will appear that 
any functions of two variables are equivalent whose correspond 
ing moduli are all equal

thus the conditions upon which depends the satisfaction of 

the equation

are seen to be

the equation

it is very easy to assign by induction from and the 
general form of an expanded elective function it is evident 
that if the number of elective symbols is m the number of the 
moduli will be and that their separate values wiu be obtained 
by interchanging in every possible way the values and in the 
places of the elective symbols of the given function the several 
terms of the expansion of which the moduli serve as coefficients 
will then be formed by writing for each that recurs under the 
functional sign the elective symbol a c which it represents 
and for each the corresponding xj c and regarding these 
as factors the product of which multiplied by the modulus from 
which they are obtained constitutes a term of the expansion 

thus if we represent the moduli of any elective function 
f xy by j aj an the function itself when expanded 
and arranged with reference to the moduli will assume the form 

iy ii • • rtn 

in which tf j are functions of x y resolved into factors 
of the forms xj y i x i y c these functions satisfy 
individually the index relations 

c p jf c 
and the further relations

the product of any two of them vanishing this will at once 
be inferred from inspection of the particular forms and 
thus in the latter we have for the values of t f c the forms 

xy xly lxy lxly 

and it is evident that these satisfy the index relation and that 
their products all vanish we shall designate tt as the con 
stituent functions of xf xy and we shall define the peculiarity 
of the vanishing of the binary products by saying that those 
functions are exclusive and indeed the classes which they 
represent are mutually exclusive 

the sum of all the constituents of an expanded function is 

unity an elegant proof of this proposition will be obtained 

hy expanding as a function of any proposed elective symbols 

thus if in we assume xy we have 

 l and gives 

i xy x yxy ¥ x y y 

it is obvious indeed that however numerous the symbols 
involved all the moduli of unity are unity whence the sum 
of the constituents is unity 

we are now prepared to enter upon the question of the 
general interpretation of elective equations for this purpose 
we shall find the following propositions of the greatest service 

prop if the first member of the general equation 
 xy be expanded in a series of terms each of which 
£s of the form at a being a modulus of the given function then 
for every numerical modulus a which does not vanish we shall 
have the equation at 

and the combined interpretations of these several equations will 
express the full significance of the original equation 

for representing the equation under the form 

at ¦ at atr 
multiplying by t we have by 
at 



properties of elective functions 

whence if o is a numerical constant which does not vanish 

 
and similarly for all the moduli which do not vanish and 
inasmuch as from these constituent equations we can form the 
given equation their interpretations will together express its 
entire significance 

thus if thp given equation were 

x y a xs and ys are identical 

we should have 
so that the expansion would assume the form 

whence by the above theorem 

a y all xs are ys 

y a all ys are xs 

results which are together equivalent to 

it may happen that the simultaneous satisfaction of equations 
thus deduced may require that one or more of the elective 
symbols should vanish this would only imply the nonexistence 
of a class it may even happen that it may lead to a final 
result of the form 

which would indicate the nonexistence of the logical universe 
such cases will only arise when we attempt to unite contra 
dictory propositions in a single equation the mannerin which 
the difficulty seems to be evaded in the result is characteristic 

it appears from this proposition that the difierences in the 
interpretation of elective functions depend solely upon the 
number and position of the vanishing moduli no change in 
the value of a modulus but one which causes it to vanish 
produces any change in the interpretation of the equation in 
which it is found if among the infinite number of different 
values which we are thus permitted to give to the moduli which 
do not vanish in a proposed equation any one value should be

preferred it is unity for when the moduli of a function are all 
either or the function itself satisfies the condition 

and this at once introduces symmetry into our calculus and 
provides us with fixed standards for reference

to equate separately to every term in which the modulus a 
does not satisfy the condition

and to leave for the value of w the sum of the remaining terms 

as the nature of the demonstration of this proposition is 
quite unaffected by the number of the terms in the second

derived series even when obtained by expansion under a func 
tional sign admits of exact and consistent interpretation

of the solution of elective equations 



in whatever way an elective symbol considered as unknown 
may be involved in a proposed equation it is possible to assign 
its complete value in terms of the remaining elective symbols 
considered as known it is to be observed of such equations 
that from the very nature of elective symbols they are neces 
sarily linear and that their solutions have a very close analogy 
with those of linear differential equations arbitrary elective 
symbols in the one occupying the place of arbitrary constants 
in the other the method of solution we shall in the first place 
illustrate by particular examples and afterwards apply to the 
investigation of general theorems 

given i x y all ys are xs to determine y in 
terms of x 

as is a function of x we may assume y vx v i xf 
such being the expression of an arbitrary function of x the 
moduli v and v remaining to be determined we have then 

 x vx v i x 

or on actual multiplication 

v x 

that this may be generally true without imposing any restriction 

upon x we must assume v and there being no condition to 

limit v we have 

y vx 

this is the complete solution of the equation the condition 
that y is an elective symbol requires that v should be an elective 



of the solution of elective equatians 

symbol also since it must satisfy the index law its interpre 
tation in other respects being arbitrary 

similarly the solution of the equation xy is 

y vx 

given x xzy all ys which are zs are xs to deter 
mine y 

as y is a function of x and z we may assume 

y v x z v x z vx vzx 

and substituting we get 

 a 

whence v the complete solution is therefore 

y v xl z vx vxzy 

vy v y v being arbitrary elective symbols and the rigorous 
interpretation of this result is that every y is either a notx 
and notz or an x and notz or an x and z 

it is deserving of note that the above equation may in con 
sequence of its linear form be solved by adding the two 
particular solutions with reference to x and z and replacing 
the arbitrary constants which each involves by an arbitrary 
function of the other symbol the result is 

yxlz lzxliix 

to shew that this solution is equivalent to the other it is 
only necessary to substitute for the arbitrary functions f z 
fj xf their equivalents 

wz w z and wx w xy 

we get y wxz w w x w x z 

in consequence of the perfectly arbitrary character of w and 
w we may replace their sum by a single symbol w whence 

y wxz wx z x i z 

which agrees with 



 of the solution of elective equations 

the solution of the equation wx yz expressed by 
arbitrary functions is 

z lwl xy ar wy yx wx 

these instances may serve to shew the analogy which exists 
between the solutions of elective equations and those of the 
corresponding order of linear differential equations thus the 
expression of the integral of a partial differential equation 
either by arbitrary functions or by a series with arbitrary coef 
ficients is in strict analogy with the case presented in the two 
last examples to pursue this comparison further would minis 
ter to curiosity rather than to utility we shall prefer to con 
template the problem of the solution of elective equations under 
its most general aspect which is the object of the succeeding 
investigations 

to solve the general equation j xy with reference to y 

if we expand the given equation with reference to x and y 
we have 

l xly t lxy lloxly 

¦tuxy 

the coefficients f c being numerical constants 
now the general expression of y as a function of x is 
y vx v x 

v and v being unknown symbols to be determined substituting 
this value in we obtain a result which may be written in 
the following form 

 vxl j v 

lx 

and in order that this equation may be satisfied without any 
way restricting the generality of x we must have

had we expanded the original equation with respect to y

but it might have startled those who are unaccustomed to the

deduced

because of the apparently meaningless character of the second 
member such a result would however have been perfectly 
lawful and the expansion of the second member would have 
given us the solution above obtained i shall in the following 
example employ this method and shall only remark that those 
to whom it may appear doubtful may verify its conclusions by 
the previous method

to determine the value of as a function of x and y 

expanding the given equation with reference to z we have

 of the solution of elective equations 

and this is the complete solution required by the same 
method we may resolve an equation involving any proposed 
number of elective symbols 

in the interpretation of any general solution of this nature 
the following cases may present themselves 

the values of the moduli j c being constant 
one or more of the coefficients of the solution may assume 
the form g or j in the former case the indefinite symbol g 
must be replaced by an arbitrary elective symbol v in the 
latter case the term which is multiplied by a factor g or by 
any numerical constant except must be separately equated 
to and will indicate the existence of a subsidiary proposition 
this is evident from 

ex given x i y all xs are ys to determine y as 
a function of x 

let l xy x i y then 
 whence by 

y x x 

 

 xx 

 xvlx 

v being an arbitrary elective symbol the interpretation of this 

result is that the class y consists of the entire class x with an 

indefinite remainder of notxs this remainder is indefinite in 

the highest sense l e it may vary from up to the entire class 

of notxs 

ex given x i z ¦ z y the class y consists of the 
entire class z with such notzs as are xs to find z 

here l xyz x i z y z whence we have the fol 
lowing set of values for the moduli 

j 

oo oo 
and substituting these in the general formula we have 

i y jiy iy 



of the solution of elective equations 

the infinite coefficient of the second term indicates the equation 

xl y all xs are ys 

and the indeterminate coefficient of the first term being replaced 
by v an arbitrary elective symbol we have 

 a y vz 

the interpretation of which is that the class z consists of all the 
ys which are not xs and an indefinite remainder of ys which 
are xs of course this indefinite remainder may vanish the 
two results we have obtained are logical inferences not very 
obvious ones from the original propositions and they give us 
all the information which it contains respecting the class z and 
its constituent elements 

ex given a y i y the class x consists of 
all ys which are notzs and all zs which are notys required 
the class z 

we have 

 zyz xy i zz y 

 llll l 

 l oo 
whence by substituting in 

zxxly ylxl 

the interpretation of which is the class z consists of all xs 
which are not ys and of all ys which are not xs an inference 
strictly logical 

ex given y i zl x all ys are zs and notxs 
proceeding as before to form the moduli we have on sub 
stitution in the general formulae 

zlxy i xl y y xy g x y 
ox zyl x vxl y i i x i y 

 yi iyw 

with the relation xy 

from these it appears that no ys are xs and that the class z 



 of the solution of elective equations 

consists of all ys which are not xs and of an indefinite re 
mainder of notys 

this method in combination with lagranges method of 
indeterminate multipliers may be very elegantly applied to the 
treatment of simultaneous equations our limits only permit us 
to offer a single example but the subject is well deserving of 
further investigation 

given the equations x i z zl y all xs are 
zs all zs are ys to determine the complete value of z with 
any subsidiary relations connecting x and y 

adding the second equation multiplied by an indeterminate 
constant x to the first we have 

xl z xzl y 
whence determining the moduli and substituting in 

jajyicl y §ly 

from which we derive 

 ary tl x y 

with the subsidiary relation 

aly 

the former of these expresses that the class z consists of all xs 
that are ys with an indefinite remainder of notxs that are ys 
the latter that all xs are ys being in fact the conclusion 
of the syllogism of which the two given propositions are the 
premises 

by assigning an appropriate meaning to our symbols all the 
equations we have discussed would admit of interpretation in 
hypotheticals but it may suffice to have considered them as 
examples of categoricals 

that peculiarity of elective symbols in viitue of which every 
elective equation is reducible to a system of equations t 
t c so constituted that all the binary products tt tty 
c vanish represents a general doctrine in logic with re 
ference to the ultimate analysis of propositions of which it 
may be desirable to offer some illustration 



of the solution of elective equations 

any of these constituents t t c consists only of factors 
of the forms xy w i z c in categoricals it there 
fore represents a compound class ie a class defined by the 
presence of certain equalities and by the absence of certain 
other qualities 

each constituent equation t c expresses a denial of the 
existence of some class so defined and the different classes are 
mutually exclusive 

thus all categorical propositions are resolvable into a denial of 
the existence of certain compound classes no member of one such 
class being a member of another 

the proposition all xs are ys expressed by the equation 
a y is resolved into a denial of the existence of a 
class whose members are xs and notys 

the proposition some xs are ys expressed by v xy is 
resolvable as follows on expansion 

v xy vxy vy xv x y xy t 
 ta y jy a i x i y vxy 
the three first imply that there is no class whose members 
belong to a certain unknown some and are st xs and not ys 
nd ys and not xs rd notxs and notys the fourth 
implies that there is no class whose members are xs and ys 
without belonging to this unknown some 

from the same analysis it appears that all hypothetical propo 
sitions may be resolved into denials of the coexistence of the truth 
or falsity of certain assertions 

thus the proposition if x is true y is true is resolvable 
by its equation x y into a denial that the truth of x 
and the falsity of y coexist 

and the proposition either x is true or y is true members 
exclusive is resolvable into a denial first that x and y are 
both true secondly that x and y are both false 

but it may be asked is not something more than a system of 
negations necessary to the constitution of an affirmative pro 
position is not a positive element required undoubtedly 



 of the solution of elective equations 

there is need of one and this positive element is supplied 
in categoricals by the assumption which may be regarded as 
a prerequisite of reasoning in such cases that there is a uni 
verse of conceptions and that each individual it contains either 
belongs to a proposed class or does not belong to it in hypo 
theticals by the assumption equally prerequisite that there 
is a universe of conceivable cases and that any given pro 
position is either true or false indeed the question of the 
existence of conceptions el eari is preliminary to any statement 
of their qualities or relations ji earv — aristotle anal post 
lib ii cap 

it would appear from the above that propositions may be 
regarded as resting at once upon a positive and upon a negative 
foundation nor is such a view either foreign to the spirit 
of deductive reasoning or inappropriate to its method the 
latter ever proceeding by limitations while the former contem 
plates the particular as derived from the general 



demonstration of the method of indeterminate multipliers as 
applied to simultaneous elective equations 
to avoid needless complexity it will be sufficient to consider 
the case of three equations involving three elective symbols 
those equations being the most general of the kind it will 
be seen that the case is marked by every feature affecting 
the character of the demonstration which would present itself 
in the discussion of the more general problem in which the 
number of equations and the number of variables are both 
unlimited 

let the given equations be 

f iy o x iy 

multiplying the second and third of these by the arbitrary 
constants h and k and adding to the first we have 

xyz h xyz a yz 



method of indeterminate multipliers 

and we are to shew that in solving this equation with reference 
to any variable z by the general theorem we shall obtain 
not only the general value of z independent of h and t but 
also any subsidiary relations which may exist between x and y 
independently of z 

if we represent the general equation under the form 
fxyz its solution may by be written in the form 

xy y yi i xiy 

 iin iioi ioii iooi 

illo iloo f jpooo 

and we have seen that any one of these four terms is to be 
equated to whose modulus which we may represent by m 
does not satisfy the condition m my or which is here the 
same thing whose modulus has any other value than or 
consider the modulus suppose m of the first term viz 

 and giving to the symbol f its full meaning 



 



illl 
fllo 



we have 



m 



 a axhi 
 aj ax 

it is evident that the condition m m cannot be satisfied 
unless the righthand member be independent of h and k and 
in order that this may be the case we must have the function 

tymmipsm independent of h and k 

 a ax 

assume then 

 ai axni

c being independent of h and h we have on clearing of frac

being equivalent to the triple system 

 
lllxxin i 

and it appears that if any one of these equations is not satisfied 
the modulus m will not satisfy the condition if m whence 
the first term of the value of z must be equated to and 
we shall have xy 

a relation between x and y independent of z 

now if we expand in terms of z each pair of the primitive 
equations we shall have 

xyo xy xyo z 
 ryo ryl xy z 
xxyo xyl x yo 
and successively eliminating z between each pair of these equa 
tions we have 

xyl xp xyo tp xyo xf xyl 

x syl syo x yo xy 
which express all the relations between x and y that are formed 
by the elimination of z expanding these and writing in full 
the first term we have 

illlllollolll xy c 

lll xllo xlll xy c 

xl x y c 

and it appears from prop that if the coefficient of xy in any 

of these equations does not vanish we shall have the equation 

xy iy 
but the coefficients in question are the same as the first members 
of the system and the two sets of conditions exactly agree 
thus as respects the first term of the expansion the method of 
indeterminate coefficients leads to the same result as ordinary 
elimination and it is obvious that from their similarity of form 
the same reasoning will apply to all the other terms 



method of indeterminate multipliers 

suppose in the second place that the conditions are satis 
fied so that m is independent of h and k it will then indif 
ferently assume the equivalent forms 

m ji 

iillil imil ixlii 

 i xiio 

these are the exact forms of the first modulus in the ex 
panded values of z deduced from the solution of the three 
primitive equations singly if this common value of m is 
or j the term will be retained in if any other constant 
value except we have a relation xy not given by elimi 
nation but deducible from the primitive equations singly and 
similarly for all the other terms thus in every case the ex 
pression of the subsidiary relations is a necessary accompaniment 
of the process of solution 

it is evident upon consideration that a similar proof will 
apply to the discussion of a system indefinite as to the number 
both of its symbols and of its equations 



postscript 

some additional explanations and references which have 
occurred to me during the printing of this work are subjoined 

the remarks on the connexion between logic and language 
p are scarcely sufficiently explicit both the one and the 
other i hold to depend very materially upon our ability to form 
general notions by the faculty of abstraction language is an 
instrument of logic but not an indispensable instrument 

to the remarks on cause p i desire to add the following 
considering cause as an invariable antecedent in nature which 
is browns view whether associated or not with the idea of 
power as suggested by sir john herschel the knowledge of its 
existence is a knowledge which is properly expressed by the word 
that to oti not by whi to sioti it is very remarkable that 
the two greatest authorities in logic modern and ancient agree 
ing in the latter interpretation difier most widely in its applica 
tion to mathematics sir w hamilton says that mathematics 



 postscript 

exhibit only the that to oti aristotle says the why belongs 
to mathematicians for they have the demonstrations of causes 
anal post lib i cap xiv it must be added that aristotles 
view is consistent with the sense albeit an erroneous one 
which in various parts of his writings he virtually assigns to the 
word cause viz an antecedent in logic a sense according to 
which the premises might be said to be the cause of the conclu 
sion this view appears to me to give even to his physical 
inquiries much of their peculiar character 

upon reconsideration i think that the view on p as to the 
presence or absence of a medium of comparison would readily 
follow from professor de morgans doctrine and i therefore 
relinquish all claim to a discovery the mode in which it 
appears in this treatise is however remarkable 

 have seen reason to change the opinion expressed in 
pp the system of equations there given for the expres 
sion of propositions in syllogism is always preferable to the one 
before employed — first in generality — secondly in facility of 
interpretation 

in virtue of the principle that a proposition is either true or 
false every elective symbol employed in the expression of 
hypotheticals admits only of the values and which are the 
only quantitative forms of an elective symbol it is in fact 
possible setting out from the theory of probabilities which is 
purely quantitative to arrive at a system of methods and pro 
cesses for the treatment of hypotheticals exactly similar to those 
which have been given the two systems of elective symbols 
and of quantity osculate if i may use the expression in the 
points and it seems to me to be implied by this that 
unconditional truth categoricals and probable truth meet to 
gether in the constitution of contingent truth hypotheticals 
the general doctrine of elective symbols and all the more cha 
racteristic applications are quite independent of any quantitative 
origin
