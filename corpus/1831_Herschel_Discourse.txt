been so sparing in external weapons whether for

t verse man is constituted a speculative being he con 
 templates the world and the objects around him not 
with a passive indifferent gaze as a set of pheno 
mena in which he has no further interest than as 
they affect his immediate situation and can be ren 
dered subservient to his comfort but as a system 
disposed with order and design he approves and 
feels the highest admiration for the harmony of its 
parts the skill and efficiency of its contrivances 
some of these which he can best trace and under 
stand he attempts to imitate and finds that to a 
certain extent though rudely and imperfectly he 
can succeed — in ouiers that although he can com 
prehend the nature of the contrivance he is totally 
destitute of all means of imitation — while in others 
again and those evidently the most important though 
he sees the effect produced yet the means by which 
it is done are alike beyond his knowledge and his 
control thus he is led to the conception of a 
power and an intelligence superior to his own and 
adequate to the production and maintenance of all 
that he sees in nature — a power and intelligence 
to which he may well apply the term infinite since 
he not only sees no actual limit to the instances in 
which tliey are manifested but finds on the con 
trary that the rther he enquires and the wider 
his sphere of observation extends they continually 
open upon him in increasing abundance and that 
as the study of one prepares him to understand 
and appreciate another refinement follows on re

ll back on itself in utter hopelessness of arriving 
at an end 

 when from external olijects he turns his view 
upon himself on his own vital and intellectual cul 
tiesy he finds that he possesses a power of ex 
amining and analysing his own nature to a certain 
extent but no fiirther in his corporeal firame he is 
sensible of a power to communicate a certain mode 
rate amount of motion to himself and other objects 
that this power depends on his will and that its ex 
ertion can be suspended or increased at pleasure 
within certun limits but how his will acts on his 
limbs he has no consciousness and whence he de 
rives the power he thus exercises there is nothing to 
assure him however he may long to know his 
senses too inform him of a multitude of particulars 
respecting the external world and he perceives an 
apparatus by which impressions from without maybe 
transmitted as a sort of signals to the interior of his 
person and ultimately to his brain wherein he is 
obscurely sensible that the thinking feeling reason 
ing being he caqs himseify more especially resides 
but by what means he becomes conscious of these 
impressions and what is the nature of the immediate 
communication between that inward sentient being 
and that machineiy his outward man he has not 
the slightest conception 

 again when he contemplates still more 
attentively the thoughts acts and passions of this 
his sentient intelligent self he finds indeed that 
he can remember and by the aid of memory can 
compare and discriminate can judge and resolve 
and above all that he is irresistibly impelled firom

the perception of any phenomenon widiout or within 
him to infer the existence of something prior which 
stands to it in the relation of a cause without which 
it would not be and that this knowledge of causes 
and their consequences is what in almost every in 
stance determines his choice and will incases where 
he is nevertheless conscious of perfect freedom to 
act or not to act he finds too that it is in his 
power to acquire more or less knowledge of causes 
and effects according to the degree of attention he 
bestows upon them which attention is again in great 
measure a voluntary act and often when his choice 
has been decided on imperfect knowledge or insuffi 
cient attention he finds reason to correct his judg 
ment though perhaps too late to influence his deci 
i sion by after consideration a world within him is 
thus opened to his intellectual view abounding with 
phenomena and relations and of the highest imme 
diate interest but while he cannot help perceiving 
that tlie msight he is enabled to obtain into this mtemal 
sphere of thought and feeling is in reality the source 
of all his power the very fountain of his predominance 
over external nature he yet feels himself capable of 
entering only very imperfectly into these recesses of 
his own bosom and analysing the operations of his 
mind — in this as in all other things in short a being 
darkly ttnse seeing that all the longest life and most 
vigorous intellect can give him power to discover by 
his own research or time to know by availing him 
self of that of others serves only to place him on 
the very frontier of knowledge and afford a distant 
glimpse of boundless realms beyond where no human 
thought has penetrated but which yet he is sure

must be no less fimuunrly known to that inldligeace 
which he truces throughout creation than the moat 
obyious trnths which he hipmolf daily apfdies to his 
most trifling purposes is it wonderful that a being 
so constituted should first encourage a hope and by 
degrees acknowledge an assurance that his ini 
tellectual existence will not terminate with the 
dissolution of his corporeal firame but rather that in 
a future state of beings disencumbered of a thousand 
obstructions which his present situation throws in 
his wayi endowed with acuter senses and higher fii 
culdesft he shall drink deep at that fountain of bene 
fiot wisdom for which the slight taste obtained on 

earth has givn him so keen a relish y c t 

 nothing then can be more urounded than i 
the olgection which has been taken tn unwmtt 
by persons well meaning perhaps certainly nar 
vowminded against the study of natural philosophy 
and indeed against all science — that it fosters in its 
cultivators an undue and overweening selfconceit 
leads them to doubt the immortality of the soul and 
to scoff at revealed religion its natural effect we 
may confidently assert on every well constituted 
mind is and must be the direct contrary no doubt 
the testimony of natural reason on whatever exer 
cised mut of necessity stop short of those truths 
which it is the olyect of revelation to make known 
but while it places the existence and principal attri 
butes of a deity on such grounds as to render doubt 
absurd and atheism ridiculous it unquestionably op 
poses no natural or necessary obstacle to further pro 
gress on the contrary by cherishing as a vital prin 
pi an unbounded spirit of enquiry and ardency of

expectation it unfetters the mind from prejudices of 
every kind and leaves it open and free to every 
impression of a higher nature which it is susceptible 
of receiving guarding only against enthusiasm and 
selfdeception by a habit of strict investigation but 
encouraging rather than suppressing every thing 
 that can offer a prospect or a hope beyond the present 
• obscure and unsatisfactory state the character of 
the true philosopher is to hope all things not impos 
sible and to believe all things not unreasonable he 
who has seen obscurities which appeared impenetra 
ble in physical and mathematical science suddenly 
dispelled and the most barren and unpromising 
fields of enquiry converted as if by inspiration 
into rich and inexhaustible springs of knowledge 
and power on a simple change of our point of view 
or by merely bringing to bear on them some prin 
ciple which it never occurred before to try will 
surely be the very last to acquiesce in any dispirit 
ing prospects of either the present or future des 
tinies of mankind while on the other hand the 
boundless views of intellectual and moral as well as 
material relations which open on him on all hands 
in the course of these pursuits the knowledge of 
the trivial place he occupies in the scale of creation 
and the sense continually pressed upon him of his 
own weakness and incapacity to suspend or modify 
the slightest movement of the vast machinery he 
sees in action around him must effectually convince 
him that humility of pretension no less than confi 
dence of hope is what best becomes his character 

 but while we thus vindicate the study of 
natural phdosophy from a charge at one time for 



or natural vhupht 

midable from the perdnacity and acrimony with 
which it was urged and still occasionally brought 
forward to the distress and disgust of every well 
constituted mind we must take care that the testi 
mony afforded by science to religion be its extent or 
value what it may shall be at least independent 
unbiassed and spontaneous we do not here allude 
to such reasoners as would make all nature bend to 
their narrow interpretations of obscure and difficult 
passages in the sacred writings such a course might 
well become the persecutors of galileo and the other 
bigots of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but 
can only be adopted by dreamers in the present age 
but without going these lengths it is no uncommon 
ling to find persons earnestly attached to science 
and anxious for its promotion who yet manifest a mor 
bid sensibility on points of this kind — who exult and 
applaud when any ct starts up explanatory as they 
suppose of some scriptural allusion and who feel 
pained and disappointed when the general course 
of discovery in any department of science runs wide 
of the notions with which particular passages in the 
bible may have impressed themselves to persons 
of such a frame of mind it ought to suffice to remarl 
on the one hand that truth can never be opposed to 
truth and on the other that error is only to be 
effectually confounded by searching deep and tracing 
it to its source nevertheless it were much to be 
wished that such persons estimable and excellent 
as they for the most part are before they throw 
the weight of their applause or discredit into 
the scale of scientific opinion on such grounds 
would reflect first that the credit and respect

worked and who not content to grope always in the 
dark and blunder on their object sought carefully 
in the observed nature of their agents for guides in

 not that it is meant by any thing above

solution of an enigma on a level with the develope

a person whose trade it is to do nothing and specu 
late on every thing the speculations of the na

uses being grounded in the realities of nature have

 after au howcter it must be confessed 
tiiat to mrnds unacquainted with science and unused 
to consider the mutual dependencies of its various 
branches there is something neither unnatural nor 
altogether blamable in the ready occurrence of this 
question of direct advantage it requires some 
habit of abstraction some penetration of the mind 
with a tincture of scientific enquiry some con 
viction of the value of those estimable and trea 
sured principles which lie concealed in the most 
common and homely facts — some experience in 
fine of success in developing and placing them in 
evidence announcing them in precise terms and 
ailying them to the explanation of other fiicts of a 
les familiar character or to the accomplishment of 
some obviously useful purpose — to cure the mind 
of this tendency to rush at once upon its object 
to undervalue iixe means in overestimation of the 
end and while gazing too intently at the goal which 
alone it has been accustomed to desire to lose sight 
of the richness and variety of the prospects that 
offer themselves on either hand on the road 

 we must never forget that it is principles 
not phenomena — laws not insulated independent 



necessary for their improvement and completion wlddiy takea 
separately do not appear to lead to any specibcally adyaa

facts— which are the objects of enquiry to the na 
tural philosopher as truth is single and consistent 
with itself a principle maj be as completely and as 
plainly elucidated by the most familiar and simple 
fact as by the most imposing and uncommon phe 
nomenon the colours which glitter on a soap 
bubble are the immediate consequence of a principle 
the most important from the variety of phenomena 
it explains and the most beautiful irom its simpli 
city and compendious neatness in the whole science 
of optics if the nature of periodical colours can be 
made intelligible by the contemplation of such a 
trivial object from that moment it becomes a noble 
instrument in the eye of correct judgment and to 
blow a large regular and durable soapbubble may 
become the serious and praiseworthy endeavour of 
a sage while children stand round and scoff or 
children of a larger growth hold up their hands in 
astonishment at such waste of time and trouble 
to the natural philosopher there is no natural 
object unimportant or trifling from the least of 
natures works he may learn the greatest lessons 
the fall of an apple to the ground may raise his 
thoughts to the laws which govern the revolutions 
of the planets in their orbits or the situation of a 
pebble may afford him evidence of the state of the 
globe he inhabits mpiads of ages ago before his 
species became its denizens 

 and this is in fact one of the great sources 
of delight which the study of natural science imparts 
to its votaries a mind which has once imbibed a 
taste for scientific enquiry and has learnt the habit 



of kattral philosophy is 

at appljring its principles readily lo the cases which 
occur has within itself an inexhaustible soiiroe of 
pure and exciting contemplations — one would 
think that shakspeare had such a mind in view when 
he describes a contemplative man as finding 

 tongues in trees — books in tbe ninning broc— 
sennons in stones— and good in every thing 

accustomed to trace the opemtion of general 
causes and the exemplification of general laws in 
circumstances where the uninformed and unenquir 
ing eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty he 
walks in the midst of wonders every object which 
mh in his way elucidates some principle affords i 
some instruction and impresses him with a sense of 
harmony and order nor is it a mere passive plea 
sure which is us communicated a thousand 
questions are continuauy arising in his mind a 
thousand subjects of enquiry presenting themselves 
winch keep his acuities in constant exercise and 
bis thoughts perpetually on the wing so that lassi 
tude is excluded from his life and that craving 
after artificial excitement and dissipation of mind 
 which leads so many into frivolous unworthy and 
destructive pursuits is altogether eradicated from 
his bosom 

 it is not one of the least advantages of these 

a pursuits which however they possess in c ommon

advantages for their pursuit and that sort of fresh

mind renders them a most delightful retreat from 
the agitations and dissensions of the world and 
from the conflict of passions prejudices and in 
terests in which the man of business finds himself 
continually involved there is something in the 
contemplation of general laws which powerfully per

ourselves imreservedly to their disposal while the 
observation of the calm energetic regularity of na

certainty with which her ends are attained tends 
irresistibly to tranquillize and reassure the mind 
and render it less accessible to repining selfish and

ing our nature into weak compliances and abject 
submission to circumstances but by filling us as 
from an inward spring with a sense of nobleness 
and power which enables us to rise superior to them 
by showing us our strength and innate dignity and 
by calling upon us for the exercise of those powers

 science is the knowledge of many orderly 
and methodically digested and arranged so as to 
become attainable by one the knowledge of reasons 
and their conclusions constitutes abstracty that of 
causes and their effects and of the laws of nature 
natural science 

 abstract science is independent of a system 
of nature — of a creation — of every thing in short 
except memory thought and reason its objects 
are first those primary existences and relations 
which we cannot even conceive not to e such as 
space time number order c and secondly 
those artificial forms or sjrmbols which thought 
has the power of creating for itself at pleasure 
and substitutmg as representatives by the aid of 
memory for combinations of those primary objects 
and of its own conceptions — either to fiicilitate the 
act of reasoning respecting them or as convenient 
deposits of its own conclusions or for their com 
munication to others such are first languagey 
oral or written its conventional forms which con

 a certain moderate dee of aequiuntance 
with abstract science is highly desirable to every 
one who would make any considerable progress in 
ysics as the universe exists in time and place 
and as motion velocity quantity number and 
order are mam elements of our knowledge of ex 
ternal things and their changes an acquaintance 
with these abstractedly considered that is to say 
independent of any consideration of the particular 
things moved measured counted or arranged 
must evidently be a useftil preparation for the more 
complex study of nature but there is yet another 
recommendation of such sciences as a preparation 
for the study of natural philosophy their objects 
are so definite and our notions of them so distinct 
that we can reason about them with an assurance

are full and true representatives of the things sig

a widely different notion of iron from one in the 
contrary predicament the vulgar who regard this 
metal as incombustible and the chemist who sees 
it bum with the utmost fury and who has other 
reasons for regarding it as one of the most com 
bustible bodies in nature — the poet who uses it as 
an emblem of rigidity and the smith and engineer 
in whose hands it is plastic and moulded like wax

obstruction and the electrician who sees in it only a 
channel of open communication by which that most 
impassable of obstacles the air may be traversed 
by his imprisoned fluid have ail different and all 
imperfect notions of the same word the meaning 
of such a term is like a rainbow — every body sees a

mistakes and controversies some excessively com

all some nay most have two or three meanings 
sufficiently distinct from each other to make a pro

even false altogether yet not distinct enough to 
keep us from confounding them in the process by 
which weanrived at it or to enable us immediately 
to recognise the fallacy when led to it by a train of 
reasoning each step of which we latna we have

attach two senses to one word or superadd a new 
meaning to an old one act as absurdly as colonists

people in their waking senses 

 they are nevertheless conclusions to which 
any one may most certainly arrive who will only 
be at the trouble of examining the chain of reasoning 
by which they have been deduced but in order to 
do this something beyond the mere elements of ab 
stract science is required waving however such 
instances as these which after all are rather calcu 
lated to surprise and astound than for any other pur 
pose it must be observed that it is not possible to 
satisfy ourselves completely that we have arrived at 
a true statement of any law of nature until setting 
out from such statement and making it a foundation 
of reasoning we can show by strict argument that 
the facts observed must follow fiom it as necessary 
logical consequences and m not vaguely and gene 
rally but with all possible precision in time place 
weight and measure 

 to do this however as we shall presently 
see requires in many cases a degree of knowledge of 
mathematics and geometry altogether unattainable by 
the generality of mankind who have not the leisure 
even if they all had the capacity to enter into such 
enquiries some of which are indeed of that degree of 
difficulty that they can be only successfully pro 
secuted by persons who devote to them their whole 
attention and make them the serious busmess of 
their lives but there is scarcely any person of 
good ordinary understanding however little exer 
cised in abstract enquiries who may not be readily 
made to comprehend at least the general train of 
reasoning by which any of the great truths of physics 



 discourse on the study 

are deduced and the essential bearings and con 
nections of the seveiai parts of natural philosophy 
there are whole branches too and very extensive 
and important ones to which mathematical reasoning 
iias never been at all applied such as chemistry 
geology and natural history in general and many 
others in which it plays a very subordinate part and 
of which the essential principles and die grounds of 
application to useful purposes may be perfectly well 
understood by a student who possesses no more 
mathematical knowledge than the rides of arith 
metic so that no one need be deterred from lihe 
acquisition of knowledge or even from active origi 
nal research in such subjects by a want of mathe 
matical information even in those brandies which 
like astronomy optics and dynamics are almost ex

which no efissctual progress am be made without 
wme acquaintance with geometry the prindpal 
tuuu may be perfectly understood without it to 
one incapable of following out the intricades of

by verified predictions must stand in the place of 
that purer and mm satisfactory reliance which a 
verification of every step in the process of reasoning 
can done afford since every one will acknowledge 
the validity of pretensions which he is in the daily 
habit of seeing brought to the test of practice 

 among the verifications of this practied

there are none more imposing than the precise pre

none certainly which carry a broader conviction

followed the ordinary rule accordingly this was 
supposed to be the case and not only so but from 
some trials and measurements purposely made by a 
philosopher of great eminence it was considered to 
be a ct sufficiently established by experiment 

 perhaps we might have remained long un 
der this impression for the measurements are deli 
cate and the subject very difficult but it has lately 
been demonstrated by an eminent french philosopher 
and mathematician m fresnel that granting certain 
principles or postulates all the phenomena of double 
refraction including perhaps the greatest variety of 
cts that have ever yet been arranged under one 
general head may be satisfactorily explained and 
deduced from them by strict mathematical calcula 
tion and thatf when applied to the cases first men 
tioned these principles give a satisfactory account 
of the want of the extraordinary image at when 
applied to such cases as those of rockcrystal or ice 
land spar they also give a correct account of both 
the images and agree in their conclusions with the 
rules before ascertamed for them but so far from 
coinciding with that part of the previous statement 
which would make lliese conclusions extend to all 
crystallised substances m fresnels principles lead 
to a conclusion quite opposite and point to a fad 
which had never been observed viz that in by ftr 
the greater number of crystallized substances which 
possess the property of double refraction neiiher of 
the images follows the ordinary law but both un

erroneous conclusion was founded having been 
latdy subjected to a fresh and more acrupulous 
examination the result has shown the insufficiency 
of the former measurements and proved in perfect 
accordance with the newly discovered laws now 
it will be observed in this case first that so far firom 
the principles assumed by m fresnel being at all 
obvious they are extremely remote from ordinary 
observation and secondly that the cluun of rea

of such length and complexity and the purely ma

chance of threading their mazes cases like this 
are the triumph of theories they show at once 
how large a part pure reason has to perform in our

 the first thing impressed on us from our 
earliest infancy is that events do not succeed one 
another at random but with a certain degree of order 
regularity and connection — some constantly and 
as we are apt to think immutably — as the alter 
nation of day and night summer and winter — others 
contingently as the motion of a body from its place 
if pushed or the burning of a stick if thrust into the 
fire the knowledge that the former class of events 
hoi gone on liniiiterruptedly for ages beyond all 
memory ilqpresses us with a strong expectation that 
it will continue to do so in the same manner and 
thus our notion of an order of nature is originated 
and confirmed if every thing were equally regular 
and periodical and the succession of events liable to 
no change depending on our own will it may be 
doubted wheuier we should ever think of looking for 
causes no one regards the night as the cause of the 
day or the day of night they are alternate efiects 
of a common cause which their regular succession 
alone gives us no sufficient due for determining it

is chiefly perhaps entirely from the other or con 
tingent class of events that we gain our notions of 
cause and effect from them alone we gather that 
there are such things as laws of nature the very 
idea of a law includes that of contingency si

bulk and we have the strongest evidence that al 
though there exist great and essential differences in 
individuals among these atoms they may yet all be 
arranged in a very limited number of groups or 
classes all the individuals of each of which are to 
all intents and purposes exactty alike in all their 
properties now when we see a great number of 
things precisely alike we do not believe this simi 
larity to have originated except from a common 
principle independent of them and that we recog 
nise this likeness chiefly by the identity of their de 
portment under similar circumstances strengthens 
rather than weakens the conclusion a line of spin 
ningjennies or a regiment of soldiers dressed 
exactly alik and going through precisely the same 
evolutions gives us no idea of independent exist 
ence we must see them act out of concert before 
we can believe them to have independent wills and 
properties not impressed on them from without 
and this conclusion which would be strong even 
were there only two individuals precisely alike in 
ill respects and for ever acquires irresistible force 
when their number is multiplied beyond the power 
of imagination to conceive if we mistake not then 
the discoveries alluded to effectually destroy the 
idea of an etemai sdfexisieni majuer by giving to 
each of its atoms the essential characters at once 
of a molwiifiuilwred artide and a subordmaie agent

speculate on the creation is not the business of the

 now in this research there would seem one 
great question to be disposed of before our enquiries 
can even be commenced with any thing like a pros 
pect of success which is whether the laws of nature 
themselves haxt that degree oi permanence and 
fixi which can render them subjects of systematic 
discussion or whether on the other hand the qua 
lities of natural agents are subject to mutation from 
the liqpse of time to the ancients who lived in 
the infancy of the world or rather in the infancy

 now this absolute indestructibility of the 
ultimate materials of the world in periods commen 
surate to our experience and their obstinate reten 
tion of the same properties under wliatever variety 
of circumstances we choose to place them however 
violent and seemingly contradictory to their natures 
is of itself enough to render it highly improbable 
that time alone should have any influence over 
them all that age or decay can do seems to be 
included in a wasting of parts which are only dissi 
pated not destroyed or in a change of sensible pro 
perties which chemistry demonstrates to arise only 
from new combinations of the same ingredients 
but after all the question is one entirely of expe 
rience we cannot be sure d priori that the laws 
of nature are immuiable but we can ascertain by 
enquiry whether they change or not and to this 
enquiry all experience answers in the negative it 
is not of course intended here to deny that great 
operations productive of extensive changes in the 
visible state of nature — such as for instance those 
contemplated by the geologists and embracing for 
their completion vast periods of time — are con 
stantly going on but these are consequences and 
fulfihnents of the laws of nature not contradictions 
•r exceptions to them no theorist regards sudi 
chnges as alterations in the fundamental principles 
of nature he only endeavours to reconcile them 
and show how they result from laws already known 
and judges of the correctness of his theory by 
their ultimate agreement

what painft and expense would not the alchemists 
for instance have been spared by a knowledge o£ 
those simple laws of composition and decomposition 
which now preclude ail idea of the attainment of 
their declared object what an amount of ingenuity 
thrown away on the pursuit of the perpetual motion 
might have been turned to better use if the simplest

heads —

an attempt was made to establish a colliery at 
bexhilly in sussex the appearance of thin seams 
and sheets of fossilwood and woodcoal widi some 
other indications similar to what occur in die neigh 
bourhood of the great coalbeds in the nordi of 
england having led to the sinking of a shaft and 
the erection of machinery on a scale of vast expense 
not less than eighty thousand pounds are said to 
have been laid out on this project which it is almost

quaintance with the usual order of nature to say 
nothing of theoretical views would have saved 
many a sanguine adventurer from utter ruin

bellows it was on one occasion attempted to em 
ploy the steam itself in apparently a much less 
circuitous manner viz by directing the current of 
steam in a violent blast from the boiler at once into 
the fire from one of the known ingredients of steam 
being a highly inflammable body and the other that 
essential part of the air which supports combustion 
it was imagined that this would have die effect of 
increasing the fire to tenfold fury whereas it sim 
ply blew it out a result which a slight consider 
ation of the laws of chemical combination and the 
state in which the ingredient elements exist in 
steam would have enabled any one to predict 
without a trial 

 ex ii after the invention of 
the divingbell and its success in subaqueous pro 
cesses it was considered highly desirable to devise 
some means of remaining for any length of time 
under water and rising at pleasure without assist 
ance so as either to examine at leisure the bottom 
or perform at ease any work that might be required 
some years ago an ingenious individual proposed a 
project by which this end was to be accomplished 
it consisted in sinking the hull of a ship made quite 
watertight with the decks and sides strongly sup 
ported by shores and the only entry secured by a 
stout trapdoor in such a manner that by disengag 
ing from within the weights employed to sink it 
it might rise of itself to the surface to render the 
trial more satisfactory and the result more striking 
the projector himself made the first essay it was 
agreed that he should sink in twenty fathoms water 
and rise again without assistance at the expiration of

twentyfour hours accordingly making all secure 
stening down his trap door and provided with all 
necessaries as well as with the means of making 
signals to indicate his situation this unhappy victim 
of his own ingenuity entered and was sunk no 
signal was made and the time appointed elapsed 
an immense concourse of people had assembled to 
witness his rising but in vain for the vessel was 
never seen more the pressure of the water at so 
great a depth had no doubt been completely under 
estimated and the sides of the vessel being at once 
crushed in the unfortunate projector perished before 
he could even make the signal concerted to indicate 
his distress 

 ex lu in the granite quarries 
near seringapatam the most enormous blocks are 
separated from the solid rock by the following neat 
and simple process the workman having found a 
portion of the rock sufficiently extensive and situ 
ated near the edge of the part already quarried lays 
bare the upper surce and marks on it a line in the 
direction of the intended separation along which a 
groove is cut with a chisel about a couple of inches 
in depth above this groove a narrow line of fire 
is then kindled and maintained till the rock below is 
thoroughly heated immediately on which a line of 
men and women each provided with a pot full of 
cold water suddenly sweep off the ashes and pour 
the water into the heated groove when the rock at 
once splits with a dean fracture square blocks of 
six feet in the side and upwards of eighty feet in 
length are sometimes detached by this method or 
by another equally simple and efficacious but not

•mineralogical detail 

 ex s hi hardly less simple and 
efficacious is the process used in some parts of france 
where millstones are made when a mass of stone 
sufficiently jarge is found it is cut into a cylinder 
several feet high and the question then arises how 
to subdivide this into horizontal pieces so as to make 
as many millstones for this purpose horizontal 
indentations or grooves are chiselled out quite round 
the cylinder at distances corresponding to the thick 
ness intended to be given to the miustones into 
•which wedges of dried wood are driven these are 
then wetted or exposed to the night dew and next 
morning the different pieces are found separated 
from each other by the expansion of the wood con 
sequent on its absorption of moisture an irresistible 
natural power thus accomplisliing almost without 
any trouble and at no expense an operation which 
from the peculiar hardness and texture of the fitone 
would otherwise be impracticable but by the most 
powerful machinery or the most persevering labour

slowness and in such cases it is often of the highest 
practical importance to accelerate them the 
bleaching of linen for instance performed in the 
natural way by exposure to sun rain and wind 
requires many weeks or even months for its com

cloth in a liquid chemically prepared the same 
effect is produced in a few hours the whole circle 
of the arts indeed is nothing but one continued 
comment upon this head of our subject the 
instances above given are selected not on account 
of their superior importance but for the simplicity 
and directness of application of the principles on 
which they depend to the objects intended to be 
attained 

 but so constituted is the nund of man that 
his views enlarge and his desires and wants in

vapidity so that no sooner has the successful exer

aimplification or improvement of processes subser

again on the stretch to extend the limits of his 
newly acquired power and having once experienced 
the advantages which are to be gathered by availing 
himsdf of some of the powers of nature to accom 
plish his ends he is led thenceforward to regard 
them all as a treasure placed at his disposal if he

such he is no longer content to limit his enterprises 
to the beaten track of former usage but is constantly 
led onwards to contemplate objects which in a pre 
vious stage of his progress he would have regarded 
as unattainable and visionary had he even thought 
of them at all it is here that the investigation of 
the hidden powers of nature becomes a mine every 
vein of which is pregnant with inexhaustible wealth 
and whose ramifications appear to extend in all di 
rections wherever human wants or curiosity may lead 
us to explore 

 between the physical sciences and the arts of 
life there subsists a constant mutual interchange of 
good offices and no considerable progress can be 
made in the one without of necessity giving rbe to 
corresponding steps in the other on the one hand 
every art is in some measure and many entirely 
dependent on those very powers and qualities of the 
material world which it is the object of physical 
enquiry to investigate and explain and accordingly 
abundant examples might be cited of cases where 
the remarks of experienced artists or even ordinary 
workmen have led to the discovery of natural quali 
ties elements or combinations which have proved 
of the highest importance in physics thus to give 
an instance a soapmanufacturer remarks that the 
residuum of his ley when exhausted of the alkali for 
which he employs it produces a corrosion of his 
copper boiler for which he cannot account he 
puts it into the hands of a scientific chemist for 
analysis and the result is the discovery of one of the 
most singular and important chemical elementiy 
iodine the properties of this being studied are

found to occur most appositely in illustration and 
urt of a variety of new curious and instructiye 
lews then gaining ground in chemistry and thus 
exercise a raariecd influence over the whole body of 
that science curiosity is excited the origin of the 
new substance is traced to the seaplants from whose 
ashes the principal ingredient of soap is obtained 
and ultimately to the seawater itself it is thence 
hunted through nature discovered in salt mines and 
springs and pursued into all bodies which have a 
marine origin among the rest into sponge a 
medical practitioner then calls to mind a reputed 
remedy for the cure of one of the most grievous and 
unsightly disorders to which the human species is 
subject — the goure — which infests the inhabitants 
of mountainous districts to an extent that in this 
ivoured land we have happily no experience of 
and whidi was said to have been originally cured by 
ihe ashes of burnt sponge led by this indication 
he tries the effect of iodine on that complaint and 
the result establishes the extraordinary fact that 
ihis singular substance taken as a medicine acts 
with the utmost promptitude and energy on goure 
dissipating the largest and most inveterate in a short 
time and acting of course like all medicines even 
the most approved with occasional failures as a 
iedfic or natural antagonist against that odious 
deformity it is thus that any accession to our know 
ledge of nature is sure sooner or later to make itself

 £x b ul hardly less simple and 
efficacious is the process used in some parts of france 
where millstones are made when a mass of stone 
sufficiently jarge is found it is cut into a cylinder 
several feet high and the question then arises how 
to subdivide this into horizontal pieces so as to make 
as many millstones for this purpose horizontal 
indentations or grooves are chiselled out quite round 
the cylinder at distances correspondmg to the thick 
ness intended to be given to the millstones into 
which wedges of dried wood are driven these are 
then wetted or exposed to the night dew and next 
morning the different pieces are found separated 
from each other by the expansion of the wood con 
sequent on its absorption of moisture an irresistible 
natural power thus acoomplisliing almost without 
any trouble and at no expense an operation which 
from the peculiar hardness and texture of the fitone 
would otherwise be impracticable but by the most 
powerful machinery or the most persevering labour

again on the stretch to extend the limits of his 
newly acquired power and having once experienced 
the advantages which are to be gathered by availing 
himself of some of the powers of nature to accom

to the beaten track of former usage but is constantly 
led onwards to contemplate objects which in a pre 
vious stage of his progress he would have regarded 
as unattainable and visionary had he even thought 
of them at all it is here that the investigation of 
the hidden powers of nature becomes a mine every 
vein of which is pregnant with inexhaustible wealth 
and whose ramifications appear to extend in all di 
rections wherever human wants or curiosity may lead

 between the physical sciences and the arts of 
life there subsists a constant mutual interchange of 
good offices and no considerable progress can be 
made in the one without of necessity giving rise to 
corresponding steps in the other on the one hand 
every art is in some measure and many entirely 
dependent on those very powers and qualities of the 
material world which it is the object of physical 
enquiry to investigate and explain and accordingly 
abundant examples might be cited of cases where 
the remarks of experienced artists or even ordinary 
workmen have led to the discovery of natural quali 
ties elements or combinations which have proved 
of the highest importance in physics thus to give 
an instance a soapmanufacturer remarks tibat the 
residuum of his ley when exhausted of the alkali for 
which he employs it produces a corrosion of his 
copper boiler for which he cannot account he 
puts it into the hands of a scientific chemist for 
analysis and the result is the discovery of one of the 
most singular and important chemical elementi 
iodine the properties of this being studied

new substance is traced to the seaplants from whose 
ashes the principal ingredient of soap is obtained

as an auxiliary to augment our actual power and 
tpacitate us for undertakings which without such 
aid might seem to be hopeless now to this end it 
is necessary that we should form a just conception

pendous works of art that has been raised by man in 
modem ages consists of a mass of iron not less than 
four millions of pounds in weight suspended at a 
medium height of about feet above the sea 
the consumption of seven bushels of coal would 
suffice to raise it to the place where it hangs 

 tlie great pyramid of egypt is composed of 
granite it is feet in the side of its base and 
in perpendicular height and stands on eleven acres 
of ground its weight is therefore millions 
of pounds at a medium height of feet conse 
quently it would be raised by the effort of about 
 chaldrons of coal a quantity consumed in some 
founderies in a week 

 tlie annual consumption of coal in london 
is estimated at chaldrons the effort of 
this quantity would suffice to raise a cubical block of

centre to assert the contrary would not be to 
rebel against a power but to deny our own words 
but in natural science cause and effe are the ulti 
mate relations we contemplate and laws whether 
imposed or maintained which for aught we can per 
ceive might have been other than they are this 
distinction is very important a clever man shut 
up alone and allowed unlimited time might reason 
out for himself all the truths of mathematics by 
proceeding from those simple notions of space and 
number of which he cannot divest himself without 
ceasing to think but he could never tell by any 
effort of reasoning what would become of a lump 
of sugar if immersed in water or what impression 
would be produced on his eye by mixing the colours 
yellow and blue 

 we have thus pointed out to us as the great 
and indeed only ultimate source of our knowledge of 
nature and its laws experience by which we 
mean not the experience of one man only or ci 
one generation but the accumulated experience of 
all mankind in all ages registered in books or re 
corded by tradition but experience may be ac 
quired in two ways either first by noticing fiicts as 
ihej occur without any attempt to influence the 
frequency of their occurrence or to vary the cir 
cumstances under which they occur this is observ 
ation or secondly by putting in action causeb 
and agents over which we have control and pur 
posely varying their combinations and notidng 
what effects take place this is experiment to 
these two sources we must look as the fountuns cxf

distinction but it is nerertheless highly im 
portant to mark the different states of mind in 
inquiries carried on by their respective aids as 
well as their different effects in promoting the 
progress of science in the former we sit still 
and listen to a tale told us perhaps obscurely 
piecemeal and at long intervals of time with 
our attention more or less awake it is only by 
afierrumination that we gather its fiill import 
and often when the opportunity is gone by we 
have to regret that our attention was not more 
particularly directed to some point which at the 
time appeared of little moment but of which we 
at length appretiate the importance in the latter 
on the other hand we crossexamine our witness 
and by comparing one part of his evidence with 
the other while he is yet before us and reasoning 
upon it in his presence are enabled to put pointed 
and searcung questions the answer to which may 
at once enable us to make up our minds accord 
ingly it has been found invariably that in those 
dartments of physics where the phenomena are 
beyond our control or into which experimental 
enquiry from other causes has not been carried 
the progress of knowledge has been slow uncertain 
and irregular while in such as admit of expe 
riment and in which mankind have agreed to its 
adoption it has been rapid sure and steady for

example in our knowledge of the nature and causes 
of volcanoes earthquakes the of stones from 
the sky the appearance of new stars and dis 
appearance of old ones and other of those eat 
phenomena of nature which are altogether beyond 
our command and at the same time are of too rare 
occurrence to permit any one to repeat and rectify 
his impressions respecting them we know little 
more now than in the earliest times here our 
tale is told us slowly and in broken sentences in 
astronomy again we have at least an uninterrupted 
narrative the opportunity of observation is con 
stantly present and makes up in some measure 
for the impossibility of varying our point of view 
and calling for information at the precise moment 
it is wanted accordiny astronomy regarded 
as a science of mere observation arrived thou 
by very slow degrees to a state of considerable 
maturity but the moment that it became a 
branch of mechanics a science essentially ex 
perimental that is to say one in which any 
principle laid down can be subjected to imme 
diate and decisive trialy and where experience does 
not require to be waited for its progress suddenly 
acquired a tenfold acceleration nay to such a 
degree that it has been asserted and we believe 
with truth that were the records of all observ

coadumm to take another instance mineraky 
till modem times could hardly be said to exist 
the description of even the precious stmes in 
theophiastus and pliny are in most cases hardly 
sufficient to identify them and in many all short 
even of that humble object more recent observers 
by attending more careiy to the obvious char 
racters of minerals had firmed a pretty extensive 
catalogue of them and made various attempts to 
brrange and methodise the knowledge thus ac 
quired and even to deduce some general conclu 
sions respecting the forms they habitually assume 
but from the moment that chemical analysis was 
applied to resolve them into their constituent ele 
ments and that led by a happy accident the 
genius of bergmann discovered the general fiict that 
they could be cloven or split in such directions as 
to li bare their peculiar primitive mr fundamental 
forms which lay omcealed within them as the 
statue might be conceived encrusted in its marble 
envelope frorn that moment mineralogy ceased 
to be an unmeaning list of names a mere laborious 
cataliuing of stones and rubbish and became 
what it now i a rular methodical and most 
important science in which ev year is bringing 
to light new relalaons new laws and new practical 
applications 

 experience once recognized as the fountain 
of all our knowledge of nature it follows that in the 
study of nature and its laws we ought at once to 
qiake up our minds to dismiss as idle prejudices or 
at least suspend as premature any preconceived 



 discourse on ths stdy 

notion of what might or what ought to le the order 
of nature in any proposed case and content ouiv 
selves with observing as a plain matter of fact what 
is to experience we refer as the only ground of all 
physical enquiry but before experience itself can 
be used with advantage there is one preliminary 
step to make which depends wholly on ourselves t 
it is the absolute dismissal and clearing the mind 
of all prejudice from whatever source arising and 
the determination to stand and by the result of 
a direct appeal to facts in the first instance and of 
strict logical deduction from them afterwards now 
it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of 
prejudices which exercise very different dominion 
over the mind and moreover differ extremely in 
the difficulty of dispossessing them and the process 
to be gone through for that purpose these are — 
i prejudices of opinion 

 prejudices of sense 
 by prejudices of opinion we mean opinions 
hastily taken up either from the assertion of others 
from our own superficial views or from vulgar ob 
servation and which from being constantly ad 
mitted without dispute have obtained the strong 
hold of habit on our minds such were the opinions 
once maintained that the earth is the greatest body 
in the universe and placed immovable in its cen 
tre and all the rest of the universe created for its 
sole use that it is the nature of fire and of sounds 
to ascend that the moonlight is cold that dewsjatt 
from the air c 

 to combat and destroy such prejudices we 
may proceed in two ways either by demonstrating 



f 



of natural philosophy 

the lehood of the facts alleged in their support 
or bj showing how the appearances which seem to 
countenance them are more satisctorily accounted 
for without their admission but it is unfortim 
ately the nature of prejudices of opinion to ad 
here in a certain degree to every mind and to some 
with pertinacious obstinacy jtm mdskiftiw after all 
ground for their reasonable entertainment is de 
stroyed against such a disposition the student of 
natural science must contend with all his power not 
that we are so unreasonable as to demand of him an 
instant and peremptory dismission of all his former 
opinions and judgments all we require is that he 
will hold ihem without bigotry retain till he shall 
see reason to question them and be ready to resign 
them when fairly proved untenable and to doubt 
them when the weight of probability is shown to lie 
against them if he refuse this he is incapable of 
science 

 our resistance against the destruction of 
the other class of prejudices those of sense is com 
monly more violent at first but less persistent than 
in the case of those of opinion not to trust the 
evidence of our senses seems indeed a hard con 
dition and one which if proposed none would com 
ply with but it is not the direct evidence of our 
senses that we are in any case called upon to reject 
but only the erroneous judgments we unconsciously 
fornx firom them and this only when they can be 
shown to be so oounier evidence of the tame wrt 
when one sense is brought to testify against another 
for instance or the same sense against itself and 
the obvious conclusions in the two cases disagree so 

 



 discourse on the study 

as to compel us to acknowledge that one or other 
must be wrong for example nothing at first can 
seem a more rational obvious and incontrovertible 
conclusion than that the colour of an object is an 
inherent quality like its weight hardness c and 
that to see the object and see it of its own colour 
when nothing intervenes between our eyes and it 
are one and the same thing yet this is only a 
prejudice and that it is so is shown by bringing for 
ward the same sense of vision which led to its adop 
tion as evidence on the other side for when the 
differently coloured prismatic rays are thrown in a 
dark room in succession upon any object whatever 
be the colour we are in the habit of calling its own 
it win appear of the particular hue of the light which 
falls upon it a yellow paper for instance will ap 
pear scarlet when illuminated by red rays yellow 
when by yellow green by green and blue by blue 
rays its own so called proper colour not in ae leatt 
degree mixing with that it so exhibits 

 to give one or two more examples of the 
kind of illusion which the senses practise on us or 
rather which we practise on ourselves by a mis 
interpretation of their evidence the moon at its 
rising and setting appears much larger than when 
high up in the sky this is however a mere erro 
neous judgment for when we come to measure its 
diameter so far from finding our conclusion borne 
out by ct we actually find it to measure materially 
less here is eyesight opposed to eyesight with the 
advantage of deliberate measurement in ventrflo 
quism we have the hearing at variance with all the 
other senses and especially with the sight which is

sometimes contradicted bj it in a very extraordinary 
and sarprifiing mann as when the voice is made to 
seem to issaefiom an inanimate and motionless object 
if we ange our hands one into icecold water and 
the other into water as hot as can be home and 
after letting them stay awhile suddenly transfer 
them both to a vessel full of water at a blood heat 
the one will feel a sensation of heat the other of 
cold and if we cross the two first fingers of one 
hand and place a pea in the fork between them 
moving and rolling it tboat on a table we shall 
especially if we dose our eyes be fully persuaded 
we have two peas if the nose be held while we 
are eating cinnamon we shall perceive no difference 
between its flavour and that of a deal shaving 

 these and innumerable instances we might 
dte will convince us that though we are never de 
ceived in the sensible impression made by external 
objects on us yet in forming our judgments of them 
we are greatly at the mercy of circumstances 
which either modify the impressions actually re 
ceived or combine them with adjuncts which have 
become habitually associated with different judg 
ments and therefore that in estimating the degree 
of confidence we are to place in our conclusions 
we must of necessity take into account these modi 
fying or accompanying circmnstances whatever they 
maybe we do not of course here speak of deranged 
organization such as for instance a distortion of the 
eye producing double vision and still less of mental 
delusion which absolutely perverts the meaning of 
sensible impressions

stances rendered sambles that is to say analjrsed 
and shown to consistin the motions or other affections 
of sensible objects themselves for instance the phe 
nomenon of the sound produced by a musical string 
ix a bell when struck may be shown to be the result 
of a process consisting in the rapid vibratory motion 
of its parts communicated to the air and thence to 
our ears though the immediate effect on our organs 
of hearing does not excite the least idea of such a 
motion on the other hand there are innumerable 
instances of sensible impressions which at least at 
present we are incapable of tracing beyond the 
mere sensation for example in the sensations of 
bitterness sweetness c these accordingly if 
we were inclined to form hasty decisions might be 
regarded as ultimate qualities but the instance of 
sounds just adduced alone would teach us caution 
in such decisions and incline us to believe them 
mere results of some secret process going on in 
our organs of taste which is too subtle for us to

trace a simple experiment will serve to set this 
in a clearer light a solution of the salt called by 
chemists nurate of silvery and another of the ajjpo 
svlphite ofsodoy have each of them separately when 
taken into the mouth a disgustingly bitter taste 
but if they be mixed or if one be tasted before the 
mouth is thoroughly cleared of the other the sensi 
ble impression is that of intense sweetness again 
the salt called tungstate of soda when first tasted 
sweet but speedily dianges to an intense and pure 
bitter like quassia 

 how r we may ever be enabled to attain a 
knowledge of the ultimate and inward processes of 
nature in the production of phenomena we hav ao 
means of knowing but to judge from the degree of 
obscurity which hangs about the mly case in which 
we feel within ourselves a direct power to produce 
any one there seems no great hope of penetratiag 
so far the case alluded to is the production f 
motion by the exertion of force we are conscioua 
of a power to move our limbs and by their inter 
vention other bodies and that this effect is the 
result of a certain inexplicable process which we 
are aware of but can no way describe in words bj 
which we exert ce and even when such ex 
ertion produces no visible effect as when we press 
our two hands violently together so as just to opp 
pose each others effort we still perceive by the 
fatigue and exhaustion and by the impossibility of 
maintaining the effort long that something is going 
on within us of which the mind is the agent and 
the will the determining cause this impresaioq

wfaidi we receive of the nature of force from our 
own effort and our sense of fatigue is quite different 
from that which we obtain of it from seeing the 
estd of force exerted bj others in producing itio 
ijmi were there no such thing as motion had 
we been from infancy shut up in a dark dungeon 
and every limb encrusted with plaster this internal 
codscionsness would give us a complete idea of 
fiitce but when set at liberty habit alone would 
enable us to recognize its exertion by its signaly 
bboticra and dktt only by finding that the same 
action d the mind which in our confined state en 
aues u to fiitigue and exhaust ourselves by the 
tennon of our muscles puts it in our power when 
at liberty to move ourselves and other bodies but 
how obscure is our knowledge of the process going 
on within us in the exercise of this important privi 
lege in virtue of which alone we act as hrect causesy 
we may judge firom this that when we put any limb 
m modon the seat of the exertion seems to us to 
be m limb whereas it is demonstrably no such 
thmg but either in the brain or in the spinal 
nsarrow the proof of which is that if a little fibre 
called a nerve which forms a communication between 
the limb and the brain or spine be divided in any 
port of its course however we may make the effort 
the limb will not move 

 this one instance of the obscurity which 
hangs about the only act of £rect ccatsatian of 
which we have an immediate consciousness will 
flyffee to iow how little prospect there is that 
in our investigation of nature we shall ever be able 
to snive at a knowledge of ultimate causes and wis

teach to limit our views to that of imos and to 
the analysis of complex phenomena by which they 
are resolved into simple mes whidi appearing to 
us incapable of fiirther analysis we must consent 
to rard as causes nor let any one complain of 
this as a limitation of his acuities we have here 
 ample room and verge enough for the aill exer 
cise of all the powers we possess and besides it 
does so happen that we are actuauy able to trace 
up a very large portion of the phenomena of the uni 
verse to this one anuey viz the exertion of mecha 
nical yonoe indeed so large a portion that it has 
been made a matter of speculation whether this is 
not the only one that is capable of acting on material 
beings 

 what we mean by the analysis of oonlex 
phenomena into simpler ones will best be under 
stood by an instance let us therefore take the 
phenomenon of sound and by considering the 
various cases in which sounds of all kinds are pro 
duced we shall find that they all agree in these 
points — st the excitement of a motion in the 
sounding body dly the communication of this 
motion to the air or other intermedium whidi is 
interposed between the sounding body and our 
ears sdly the propation of such motion from 
particle to particle of such intermedium in due 
successicm thly its communication from the par 
ticles of the intermedium adjacent to the ear to 
the ear itsel£ thly its conveyance in the ear by a 
certain mechanism to the auditory nerves thlythe 
excitement of sensation now in this analysis we 
perceive that two principal matters must be under

stood before we can have a true and ooiqilete 
knowledge of fioond— lit the ezcitemeiit and 
propagation of motion sdlj the prodndion of 
sensation these then are tiro other phenoinena 
of a simplery or it would be more correct to say of 
a more general or elementary order into wlch 
the complex phenomenon of sound resdves itsel£ 
but again if we consider the communication of 
motion hem body to body or from one part to 
another of the same we sludl percriye that it is 
again resolvable into sereral other phenomena 
ist the original setting in motion of a material 
body or any part of one dly the behaviour 
of a particle set in motion when it meets another 
lying in its way or is otherwise impeded or inflo 
enced by its connection with surrounding particles 
dly the behaviour of the particles so impeding 
or influencing it under such circumstances besides 
wiiich the last two point out another phenomenon 
which it is necessary also to consider viz the phe 
nomencm of the connection of the parts of material 
bodies in masses by which they form aggregates 
and are enabled to influence each others motions 

 thus then we see that an analysis of the 
phenomenon of sound leads to the enquiry st of 
two cauteif viz the cause of motion and the cause 
of sensation these being phenomena which at least 
as human knowledge stands at present we are 
unable to analyse further and therefore we set 
them down as simple elementary and referable 
for any thing we can see to the contrary to the 
hnmediate action of their causes dly of several 
questions relating to the connection between the

motion of material bodies and its cause such as 
whd ufiil kegpen when a monridg body is sur 
rounded on all sides bj others not in motion what 
wfu happen when a body not in motion is advanced 
upon bjr a moving one it is evident that the 
answers to such quealiona as these can be no 
other than hnob rfnuoum in the sense we have 
above attributed to laws of nature vias a statement 
in words of what will happen in such and such 
proposed general contingencies lastly we are 
led by pursuing the analysis and considering the 
phenomenon of the aggration of the parts of 
material bodies and the way in which they in 
fluence each oihev to two other general pheno 
mena viz the cohesion and elasticity of matter 
and these we have no means of analysing further 
and must therbre regard ihem till we see 
reasons to the contrary aa tmmate phemomem 
and referable to the direct action of causes viz 
aa attractive and a repukiveyora 

 of force as cosmlerbelanced by opposing 
feree we ham as already said an internal con 
sciousness and though it may seem straage to us 
that matter should be capable of exerting on mat 
ter the bbtme kind of effort wfaidi jvuiffaag alone 
ftom thia oonsdousness we might be led to re 
gard aa a mental one yet we cannot refuse the 
direct evidce of our senses which shows us 
that when we keep a spring stretched with one 
hand we feel our effort qiposed exactly in the same 
way as if we had oursdves opposed it with the 
other hand or as it would be by that of anodier 
person the enquiry therefore into the aggre

gatkm of matter resotwet itielf into the general 
question what will be the behatioiir of material 
particles mider the mutual action of oppoaing 
ftices capable of oonnteibalanciag eadi other 
and tbe ansirer to this question can be no other 
than the anbonncement of the ana of equilibriudi 
whatever kw that maj be 

 with regard to the cause of sensatinnj it 
must be regarded as much more obscure than that 
af motion inasmuch as we hanre no oonacioua know 
lee of ity ft we hae no power by any act of 
our minds and will to call up a sensation it is 
true we are not destitute of an approach to it 
since by an eflbrt of memory and imagination we can 
produce in cor mincb an impression or idea of a 
sensation which in peculiar cases may even i 
proach hi vividness to actual reality in dreams too 
and in some cases of disordered nerves we have 
sensatiimb without objects but if force as a cause 
of motion is obscure to us even while we are in the 
act of exercfaiiig it how much more so is this 
other cause whose exercise we can only imitate 
inerftctly by any voluntary act and of whose 
purely bitemal action we are only fuly conacious 
when in a state that incapacitates us from reasoning 
and almost from observation 

 dismissing tlien as beyond onr reach the 
enquiry into causes we must be content at present 
to concentrate our attention oa the laws which pre 
vail among phenomena and which seem to be thehr 
iwmediwte results from die instance we have just 
given we may pesceive that every enquiry into the

out into as many different and distinct enquiries as 
there are simple or elementary phenomena into 
which it may be analysed and that therefore it 
would greatly assist us in our study of nature if we 
could by any means ascertain what are the lidti 
mate phenomena into which all the composite ones 
presented by it may be resolved there is how 
ever clearly no way by which this can be ascertained 
d priori we must go £b nature itself and be 
guided by the same kind of rule as the chemist in 
his analysis who accounts every ingredient an de 
meni tiu it can be decompounded and resolved into 
others so in natural philosophy we must account 
every phenomenon an elementary or simple one till 
we can analyse it and show that it is the result of 
others which in their turn become elementary 
thus in a modified and relative sense we may 
stiu continue to speak of causes not intending 
thereby those ultimate principles of action on whose 
exertion the whole firame of nature depends but 
of those proximate links which connect pheno 
mena with others of a simpler higher and more 
general or elementary kind for example we 
may regard the vibration of a musical string as 
the proximate cause of the soimd it yields receiving 
it so r as an ultimate ftct and waving or de 
ferring enquiry into the cause of vibrations which 
is of a higher and more general nature 

sh moreover as in chemistry we are some 
times compelled to acknowledge die existence of 
elements different from those already identified and 
known though we cannot insulate them and to 
perceive that substances have the characters of

compouncb and must therefore be susceptible of 
analysis though we do not see how it is to be 
set about so in physics we may perceive the 
complexity of a phenomenon without being able 
to perrm its analysis for example in mag 
netism the agency of electricity is clearly made 
out and they are shown to stand to one another in 
the relation of effect and cause at least in so fiur 
as that all the phenomena of magnetism are product ay v 
ble by electricity but no electric phenomena have wf 
hitherto ever been produced by magnetism but d i ccrj 
che analysis of magnetism in its relation to particular k 
metals is not yet quite satisctorily performed and 
we are compelled to admit the existence of some 
cause whether proximate or ultimate whose pre ru 
sence in the one and not in the other phenomenon 
determines their difference cases like these of all 
which science presents offer the highest interest 
they excite enquiry like the near approach to the 
solution of an enigma they show us that there is 
light could only a certain veil be drawn aside 

 in pursuing the analysis of any pheno 
menon the moment we find ourselves stopped by 
one of which we perceive no analysis and which 
therefore we are forced to refer at least provision 
ally to the class of ultimate facts and to regard as 
elementary the study of that phenomenon and of 
its laws becomes a separate branch of science if 
we encoimter the same elementary phenomenon in

serving those with which it is habitually associated 
that may help us at length to its analysis it is 
thus that sciences increase and acquire a mu 
tual relation and dependraicy it is thus too 
that we are at length enabled to trace parallels 
and analogies between great branches of science 
themselves which at length terminate in a percep 
tion of their dependence on some common phe 
nnenon of a more general and elementary nature 
than that which form the subject of either se 
parately it was thus for example that previous 
to oersteds great discovery of electromagnetism 
a general resemblance between the two sciences of 
electricity and magnetism was recognised and 
many of the chief phenomena in each were ascer 
tained to have their parallels mutaiis mutemditf in 
the other it was thus too that an analogy sub 
sisting between sound and light has been gradually 
traced into a closeness of agreement which can 
hardly leave any reasonable doubt of their vlti 
mate coincidence in one common phenomenon the 
vibratory motion of an elastic medium if it be 
allowed to pursue our illustration from chemistry 
and to ground its application not on what has been 
but on what may one day be done it is thus that 
the general femily resemblance between certain 
groups of bodies now regarded as elementary 
as nickel and cobalt for instance chlorine iode 
and brome will perhaps lead us hereafter to per 
ceive relations between them of a more intimate 
kind than we can at present trace 

 on those phenomena which are most fre 
quently encountered in an analysis of nature and 



of natural philosophy 



irbich most decidedly resist further 
it is evident that the greatest pains and attention 
ought to be bestowed not onl j because they funiish 
a key to the greatest number o enquiries ani 
srve to group and classify together the greatest 
range of phenomena but by reason of their higher 
nature and because it is in these that we must 
look for the direct action of causes and the most 
extensive and general enunciation of the laws of 
nature these once discovered place in our power 
the explanatimi of all particular facts and become 
grounds ci reasoning independent of particular 
trial thus playing the same part in natural philo 
sophy that axioms do in geometry containing in a 
refined and condensed state and as it were in a 
quintessence all that our reason has occasion to 
draw from experience to enable it to follow out 
the truths of physics by the mere implication of 
logical argument indeed the axioms of geometry 
themselves may be regarded as in some sort an 
appeal to experience not corporeal but mental 
when we say the whole is greater than its part 
we announce a general fbct which rests it b 
true on our ideas of whe and part but in abs 
tracting these notions we begin by considering 
them as subsisting in space and time and body 
and again in linear and superficial and solid space 
again when we say the equals of equals are equal 
we mentally make comparisons in equal spaces 
equal tunes c so that these axioms however 
selfevident are still general propositions so far of 
the inductive kind thatindependently of experience 
they would not present themselves to the mind 



 discourse ok the tudt 

the onlj difference between these and axioms ob 
tained from extensive induction is this that in 
raising the axioms of geometry the instances offer 
themselves spontaneously and without the trouble 
of search and are few and simple in raising 
those of nature they are infinitely numerous com 
plicated and remote so that the most diligent 
research and the utmost acuteness are required 
to unravel their web and place their meaning in 
evidence 

 by far the most general phenomenon with 
which we are acquainted and that which occurs 
most constantly in every enquiry into which we 
enter is motion and its communication djmamics 
then or the science of force and motion is thus 
placed at the bead of all the sciences and hi 
pily for human knowledge it is one in which 
the highest certainty is attainable a certainty no 
way inferior to mathematical demonstration as 
its axioms are few simple and in the highest de 
gree distinct and definite so they have at the same 
time an immediate relation to geometrical quantity 
space time and direction and thus aceommodate 
themselves with remarkable cility tp geometrical 
reasoning accordingly their consequences maybe 
pursued by arguments purely mathematical to any 
extent insomuch that the limit of our knowledge 
of dynamics is determined only by that of pure 
mathematics which is the case in no other branch of 
physical science 

 but it win now be asked how we are to 
proceed to analyse a composite phenomenon into 
simpler ones and whether any general rules can be 



or natural philosophy 

given for this important process we answer none 
any more than to pursue the illustration we have 
already had recourse to general rules can be laid 
down by the chemist for the analysis of substances 
of which all the ingredients are unknown sudi 
rules could they be discovered would include the 
whole of natural science but we are very fiur indeed 
from being able to propound them however we 
are to recollect that the analysis of phenomena 
philosoically speaking is principally useful as it 
enables us to recognize and mark for special inves 
tigation those which appear to us simple to set me 
thodically about determining their laws and thus to 
clitate the work of raising up general axioms or 
forms of words which shall include the whole of 
them which shall as it were transplant them out of 
the external into the intellectual world render them 
creatures of pure thought and enable us to reason 
them out dprioru and what renders the power of 
doing this so eminently desirable is that in thus 
reasoning back from generals to particulars the pro 
positions at which we arrive apply to an immense 
multitude of combinations and cases which were 
never individually contemplated in the mental pro 
cess by which our axioms were first discovered and 
tbat consequently when our reasonings are pushed 
to the utmost limit of particularity their results 
appear in the form of individual factsy of which we 
might have had no knowledge from immediate expe 
rience and thus we are not only furnished with the 
explanation of all known facts but with the actual 
discovery of such as were before unknown a re 
markable example of this has already been mentioned

iji fresners d priori discovery of the extraordinary 
refraction of both rajs in a doubly refracting medium 
to give another example — the law of gravitation 
is a physical axiom of a very high and universal 
kind and has been raised by a succession of indu 
tlons and abstractions drawn from the observation of 
numerous facts and subordinate laws in the phmetar 
system when this law is taken for granted and 
laid down as a basis of reasoning and applied to 
the actual condition of our own planet one of the 
consequences to which it leads is that the earth 
instead of being an exact sphere must be compressed 
or flattened in the direction of its polar diameter 
the one diameter being about thirty miles shorter 
than the other and this conclusion deduced at 
first by mere reasoning has been since found to be 
true in fact all astronomical predictions are 
examples of the same thing 

 in the important busmess of raising these 
axioms of nature we are not as in the analysis of 
phenomena left wholly without a guide the na 
ture of abstract or general reasoning points out in 
a great measure the course we must pursue a 
law of nature beii the statement of what will 
happen in certain general contingencies may be 
regarded as the announcement in the same words 
of a whole group or dass of phenomena when 
ever therefore we perceive that two or more phe 
nomena agree in so many or so remarkable points as 
to lead us to regard them as forming a dass orgroiqi 
if we lay out of consideration or abstrad au the cir 
cumstances in which they disagree and retain in 
our minds those only in which they agree and

definition w statement of one of them in such words 
that it shall eipply equally to them all such state 
ment will pear in the form of a general prcqxwi 
tion having so r at least the character a law of

 for example a great number of trans 
pfflrent substances when exposed in a certain par 
ticular manner to a beam of light which has been 
fureptt by imdeigoing certain reflexions or refrac 
tions and has thereby acquired peculiar properties 
and is said to be polarized exhibit very vivid 
and beaut ccdours disposed in streaks bands 
e of great regularity which seem to arise within 
the substance and which from a certain vegu 
iar sueoession observed in their appearance are 
eahed periodical occurs among the substances 
which exhibit periodical colours occur a great 
variety of transparent solids but no fluids and no 
opaque solids here then there seems to be suf 
ficient community of nature to enable us to use a 
glboesvl term and to state the proposition as a law 
viz inaupaiwiu solids exhibit periodical colours by 
exposure to polarized light however this though 
true of many does not apply to all transparent 
solids and therefore we cannot state it as a general 
iruth ht law of nature in this form although the 
reverse mropositicm that all solids which exhibit 
such odours in such circumstances are trans 
pariii would be correct and general it becomes 
necessary then to make a list of those to which it 
does apply and thus a great number substances

intimate and extensive sense of the word could 
hardly be said to exist among the greek phi 
losophers of whose attainments in science alone 
in the earlier ages of the world we have any posi 
tive knowledge and that but a very limited one 
we are struck with the remarkable contrast be 
tween their powers of acute and subtle disput 
ation their extraordinary success in abstract rea 
soning and their intimate familiarity with subjects 
purely intellectual on the one hand and on the 
other with their loose and careless consideration 
of exteinal nature their grossly illogical deduc 
tions of principles of sweeping generally from 
few and illobserved facts in some cases and their 
reckless assumption of abstract principles having 
no foundation but in their own imaginations in 
others mere forms of words with nothing cor 
responding to them in nature from which as from 
mathematical definitions postulates and axioms 
tfaey imagined that all phenomena could be de 
rived all the laws of nature deduced thus for 
instance having settled it in their own minds that 
a circle is the most perfect of figures they con 
cluded of course that the movements of the heavenly 
bodies must all be performed in exact circles and 
with uniform motions and when the plamest ob 
servation demonstrated the contrary instead of 
doubting the principle they saw no better way of 



 mscourse on the tudt 

getting out of the difficulty than by having recourse 
to eadless combinations of circular motions to pre 
serve their ideal perfection 

 undoubtedly among the greek philosophers 
were many men of transcendent talents and virtuesy 
the ornaments of their species and justly entitled to 
the veneration of all posterity but regarded as abody 
they can hardfy be considered otherwise than as a 
knot of disputatious candidates for popular favour 
too busy in maintaining their ascendency over their 
followers and admirers by an ostentatious display of 
superior knowledge to have the leisure had they 
always the indinatmmi to base their pretensions oa 
a deep and sure foundation and yet too sensible of 
the disgrace and inconvenience of failure not to 
defend their dogmas however elialkyw when hiee 
prhnulgated against their keen and sagacious oppo 
netktb by every art of sophism or appeal to passioii 
hence the crudities and chimeiical views with 
whidi their systems plubsophy both natural and 
moral were overloaded their endksa disputes 
sboat terbal subtleties and last and worst the 
proud assunob with wluch they sheltered ijgimk

in all future ages as the great reformer of philo 
sophy though his own actual contributions to the 
stock of physical truths were small and his ideas 
of particular points strongly tinctured with mistakes 
and errors which were the £iult rather of the 
general want of physical tnformation of the age 
than of any narrowness of view on his own part 
and of this he was fully aware it has been at 
tempted by some to lessen the merit of this great 
achievement by showing that the inductive method

and modem by the mere instinct of mankind bat

a new and hitherto untried process which charac

evident that every step of our enquiry must be per 
fectiy free from the slightest degree of looseness 
and indecision and carry with it the full force of 
strict numerical announcement and that therefore 
the observations themselves on which all laws ulti 
mately rest ought to have the same property none 
of our senses however gives us direct information 
for the exact comparison of quantity number 
indeed that is to say integer number is an object 
of sense because we can count but we can 
neither weigh measure nor form any precise esti 
mate of fractional parts by the unassisted senses 
scarcely any man could tell the difference between 
twenty pounds and the same weight increased or 
diminished by a few ounces still less could he judge 
of the proportion between an ounce of gold and a 
hundred grains of cotton by balancing them in his 
hands to take another instance the eye is no 
judge of the proportion of different degrees of illu 
mination even when seen side by side and if an 
interval elapses and circumstances change nothing 
can be more vague than its judgments when we 
gaze with idmiration at the gorgeous spectacle of 
the golden clouds at sunset which seem drenched 
in light and glowing like flames of real fire it is 
hardly by any effort we can persuade ourselves 
to regard them as the very same objects which at 
noonday pass unnoticed as mere white clouds basking 
in the sun only participating from their great hori 
zontal distance in the ruddy tint which luminaries 
acquire by shining through a great extent of the 
vapours of the atmosphere and thereby even losing 
iomething of their light so it is with our esti 



of katvkal philosophy 

mates of time velocity and all other matters of 
quantity they are absolutely vague and inadequate 
to form a foundation for any exact conclusion 

 in this emergency we are obliged to have 
recourse to instrumental aids that is to contrivances 
which shall substitute for the vague impressions 
of sense the precise one of number and reduce all 
measurement to counting as a first preliminary 
towards effecting this we on convenient tiandards 
of weight dimension time and invent contriv 
ances for readily and correctly repeating them as 
often as we please and counting how often such a 
standard unit is contained in the thing be it weight 
space time or angle we wish to measure and if 
there be a fractional part over we measure this 
as a new quantity by aliquot parts of the former 
standard 

 if every scientific enquirer observed only 
fir his own satisfaction and reasoned only on his 
own observations it would be of littie importance 
what standards he used or what contrivances if 
only just ones he employed for this purpose but if 
it be intended as it is most important they should 
that obsarvations once made should remain as records 
to all mankind and to all posterity it is evidentiy of 
the highest consequence that all enquirers should 
agree on the use of a common standard and that 
this should be one not liable to change by lapse 
of time the selection and verification of such 
standards however will easily be understood to be 
a matter of extreme difficulty if only firom the mere 
circumstance that to verify the permanence of one 
standard we must compare it with others which it 



 picursx on the study 

is possible may be themselves inaociirate or at least 
stand in need of verification 

 here we can onlj call to our aasistadce 
the presumed permanence of the great laws of 
nature with all experience in its fiwour and the 
sixong impression we have of the general coraposare 
and steadiness of every thing relating to the gigantic 
mass we inhabit — die great globe itsel£ la its 
uniform rotation on its axis accordingly we find a 
standard of time which nothing has ever given us 
reason to regard as sdbject to change and which 
compared with other periods which the revolutiona 
of the planets about the sun a£sird has demonstrably 
undergone none smce the earliest history in the 
dimensions of the earth we find a natural unit 
of the measure of space whidi possesses in per 
fection every quality that can be desired and ia 
its attraction corniced with its rotation the re 
searches of dynamical science have enabled us 
through the medium of the pendulum to obtain 
another invariable standard more refined and kas 
obvious it is true in its origin but possessing a 
great advantage in its capability of ready verification 
and therefire easily made to serve as a check on 
the other the former viz direct measurement 
of the dimensions of the earth is the origin of 
the metre the french unit of linear measure the 
latter of the british yard theoretically speaking 
they are equally eligible but when we consider that 
the qmntity dxrecdy meagured in the case of die 
mdtre is a length a great many thousand times the 
final unit and in the pendulum or yard very nearfy 
the unit itself there can be no hesitation in ving 



ov natural fhilpht 

the preferenoe as an original meaaure to the hmer 
became any error committed in the prooefla bj 
which thi is determined beoonfes subdivided in 
the final result while on the other hand any mi 
nute error ochnmitted in determining the length of 
the pendulum becomes multiplied by the repetitiol 
of the unit in all measurements of considerable 
lengths performed in yards 

l the same admirable invention of the pen 
dulum affords a means of subdividing time to an 
almost unlimited nicety a dock is nothing more 
than a piece of mechanism for counting tbs oscil 
lations o£ a pendulum and by that peculiar property 
of the pendulum that one vibration oommencea 
exactly wbere the last terminates no part of time is 
lost or gained in the juxtapositioq of die units so 
counted so that the precise fractional part c a day 
can be ascertained which each such unit measures 

 it is owing to this peculiar prciertyby 
which tikejuxtippasition of units of time and weight 
can be performed wukout errors that the whole of 
the accuracy with which time and weight can be 
multiplied and subdivided is owing tbe same 
thing cannot be accomplished in jpoee by any method 

 the abstract principle of repetition in matters of measure 
ment viz juxtappoaition of units without error is iqpplicablc 
to a great yariety of cases in which quantities are xequired to be 
determined to minute nicety in chemistry in determining 
the standard atomic weights of bodies it seems easily and com 
pletely applicable by a process which will suggest itself at once 
to every chemist and seems the only thing wanting to place 
the exactness of chemical determinations on a par with astro 
domical measurements 



 discourse on the study 

we are yet acquainted with so that our means of 
subdividing space are much inferior in precision 
the beautiful principle of repetition invented by 
borda offers the nearest approach to it but cannot 
be said to be absolutely free from the source of error 
in question the method of double weighing 
which we owe to the same distinguished observer 
affords an instance of the direct comparison of two 
equal weights independent of almost every source of 
error which can affect die comparison of one object 
with another it has been remarked by biot that 
previous to the invention of this elegant method in 
struments afforded no perfect means of ascertaining 
the weight of a body 

 but it is not enough to possess a standard 
of this abstract kind a real material measure most 
be constructed and exact copies of it taken this 
however is not very difficult the great difficulty is 
to preserve it unaltered from age to age for unless 
we transmit to posterity the units of our measure 
ments suck as we have ourselves used mem we in 
fact only half bequeath to them our observations 
this is a point too much lost sight oi and it were 
much to be wished that some direct provision fir 
so important an object were made 

 accurate and perfectfy authentic copies of the yaxd and 
pound executed in platina and hamedcally sealed in giaas 
should be deposited deep in the interior of the massite stonewofk 
of some great public building whence they could only be rescued 
with a degree of difficulty sufficient to pztdude their being dis 
tnibed unless on some very high and urgent occasion the 
act should be publicly recorded and its memory preserved by an 
finsoiption indeed how much valuable and useful infonnatiob 



of katukal philosophy 

 bat it may be asked if our measuremeiit of 
qiiantiiy is thus unavoidably liable to error how is 
it possible that our observations can possess that 
quality of numerical veracity which is requisite to 
render them the foundation of laws whose distin 
guishing perfection consists in their strict mathe 
matical expression to this the reply is twofold 
st that though we admit the necessary existence 
of numerical error in every observation we can 
always assign a limit which such error cannot pos 
sibly exceed and the extent of this htiiude oferwr 
of obtervation is less in proportion to the perfection 
oi the instrumental means we possess and the care 
bestowed oa their employment in the greater part 
of modem measurements it is in point of fact ex 
trodely minute and may be still further diminished 
almost to any required extent by repeating the 
measurements a great number of times and under a 
great variety of circumstances and taking a mean 
c the results when errors of opposite kinds will at 
length compensate each other but dly there 

of tbe actual eiisdog state of arts and knowledge at any 
period might be transmitted to posterity in a distinct tan 
gible and imperishable form if instead of the absurd and use 
leas deposition of a few coins and medals under the founds 
actions of buildings specimens of ingenious implements or 
condensed statements of scientific truths or processes in arts 
and manniactures were substituted will books infallibly 
preserve to a remote posterity all that we may desire should be 
liereafter known of ourseltea and our discoveries or all that 
posterity would wish to know and may not a useless cere 
mony be thus transformed into an act of enrolment in a perpe 
tual archive of what we most prize and acknowledge to be most 
valiiahle

more consequenoe it gives it a recognized exist 
ence in our own minds as a matter for separate 
and peculiar consideration places it on a list for 
examination and renders it a head or title under 
which information of various descriptions may be 
arranged and in consequence fits it to perform the 
office of a connecting link between all the subjects 
to which such information may refer 

 for these piurposes however a temporary 
or provisional name or one adapted for common 
parlance may suffice but when a very great mul 
titude of objects come to be referred to one class 
especially of such as do not offer very obvious 
and remarkable distinctions a more systematic 
and regular nomenclature becomes necessary in 
which the names shall recall the differences as well 
as the resemblances between the individuals of a 
class and in which the direct relation between the 
name and the object shall materially assist the so 
lution of the problem given the one to determine 
 other how necessary this may become wiu 
be at once seen when we consider the immense 
number of individual objects or rather species 
presented by almost every branch of science of any 
extent which absolutely require to be distinguished 
by names thus the botanist i conversant with from 
 to species of plants the entomo 
logist with perhaps as many of insects the chemist 
has to register the properties of combinations by 
twos threes fours and upwards in various dosesy 
of upwards of fifty different elements all distin 
guished from each other by essential differences 
and of which though a great many thousands are 



of natural philosophy s 

known by far the greater part have never yet l n 
formed although hundreds of new ones are comki 
to light in perpetual succession as the science ad 
vances all of which are to be named as they 
arise the objects of astronomy are literally as 
numerous as the stars of heaven and although not 
midre than one or two thousand require to be ex 
pressed by distinct names yet the number respect 
ing which particular information is required is not 
less than a hundred times that amount and all these 
must be registered in lists so as to be at once re 
ferred to and so that none shall escape if not by 
actual names at least by some equivalent means 

 nomenclature then is in itself undoubt 
edly an important part of science as it prevents our 
being lost in a wilderness of particulars and involved 
in inextricable confusion happily in those great 
branches of science where the objects ofclassifi 
cadonare most numerous and the necessity for a 
dear and convenient nomenclature most pressings 
no very great difficulty in its establishment is felt 
the very multitude of the objects themselves 
affords the power of grouping them in subordinate 
classes sufficiently well defined to admit of names 
and these again into others whose names may be 
come attached to or compounded with the formeri 
till at length the particular species is identified 
the facility with which the botanist the entomo 
logist or the chemist refers by name to any indivi 
dual object in his science shows what may be ac 
ocknplished in this way when characters are them 
selves distinct inodier branches however conr 
siderable difficulty is experienced this arises

 discourse on the study 

to take root and every new writer oa this inter 
esting science begins as a matter of course by 
making a talnda rasa of all former nomenclature 
and proposing a new one in its place the climax 
has at length been put to this most inconvenient 
and bewildering state of things by the appearance 
of a system supported by extraordinary merit m 
other respects and therefore carrring ihe highest 
authority in which names which had acquired 
universal circulation and had hitherto maintained 
their ground in the midst of the general confusion 
and even worked their way into common language 
as denotive of species too definite to admit of mis 
take are actually rendered generic and extended to 
whole groups comprising objects agreeing in nothing 
but the arbitrary heads of a classification fixm whidi 
the most important natural relations are professedly 
and purposely rejected 

 the classifications by which science is ad 
vanced however are widely different from those 
which serve as bases for artificial systems of nomen 
clature they cross and intersect one another as it 
were in every possible way and have for their very 
aim to interweave all the objects of nature in a dose 
andcompact web of mutual relations and dependice 
ai soon then as any resemblance or analogy any 
point of agreement whatever is perceived between 
any two or more things — be they what they wol 
whether objects or phenomena or laws — they

mediatelj and paosicfty constitute themselves into 
agnhip or dass which may become enlarged to any 
extent by the accession of such new objects pheno 
mena or laws agreeing in the same point as may 
oome to be subsequently ascertained it is thus that 
the materials of the world become grouped in natural 
§milies such as chemistry furnishes examples of 
in its various groups of acids alkalies sulphurets a 
or botany in its euphorbiaceas umbelliferae c 
t is thus too that phenomena assume their places 
inder general points of resemblance as in optic 
hose whidh refer themselves to the class of periodic 
colours double refraction c and that resem 
ilances themselves become traced which it is the 
ihisiness of induction to generalize and include in 
abstract propositions 

 but every class formed on a positive resem 
bkmce of characters or on a distinct analogy draws 
with it the consideration of a negative class in which 
that resemblance either does not subsist at all or the 
contrary takes place and again there are classes in 
which a given quality is possessed by th differ 
ent individuals in a descending scale of intensity 
 now it is of consequence to distinguish between 
cases in which there is a real opposition of quality 
or a mere diminution of intensity in some quality 
susceptible of degrees till it becomes impercep 
tibie for example between transparency and 
oiacity there would at first sight appear a direct 
opposition but on nearer consideration when we 
consider the gradations by which transparency di 
minishes in natural substances we shall see reason 
to admit that the latter quality instead of being the

of the first stage of induction — the discovert 
of proximate causes and laws of the lowest 
degree of generality and their yerification 

 the first thing that a philosophic mind 
considers when any new phenomenon presents 
itself is its explanation or reference to an imme 
diate producing cause if that cannot be ascer 
tained the next is to generauze the phenomenon 
and include it with others analogous to it in the 
expression of some law in the hope that its con 
sideration in a more advanced state of knowledge 
may lead to the discovery of an adequate proxi 
mate cause 

 experience having shown us the manner 
in which one phenomenon depends on another in a 
great variety of cases we fin ourselves provided 
as science extends with a continually increasing 
stock of such antecedent phenomena or causes 
meaning at present merely proximate causes 
competent under different modifications to the 
production of a great multitude of effects besides 
those which originally led to a knowledge of them 
to such causes newton has applied the term verm 
eauum that is causes recognized as having a real ex 
istence in nature and not being mere hypotheses or 
figments of the mind to exemplify the distinc 
tion — the phenomenon of shells found in rocksi at

a great height above the sea has been attributed 

to several causes by some it has been ascribed 

to a plastic virtue in the soil by some to ferment 

ation by some to the influence of the celestial 

bodies by some to the casual passage of pilgrims 

with their scallops by some to birds feeding on 

diellfish and by all modem geologists with one 

consent to the life and death of real mollusca 

at the bottom of the sea and a subsequent 

alteration of the relative level of the land and 

sea of these the plastic virtue and celestial 

influence belong to the class of figments of fancy 

casual transport by pilgrims is a real cause and 

might account for a few shells here and there 

dropped on frequented passes but is not extensive 

enough for the purpose of explanaticm ferment 

ation generally is a real cause so flu as that 

there ti such a thing but it is not a real cause 

of the production of a shell in a rock since no 

such thing was ever witnessed as one of its effects 

and rocks and stones do not ferment on the other 

hand for a shellfish dying at the bottom of the 

sea to leave his shell in the mud where it becomes 

silted over and imbedded happens daily and the 

elevation of the bottom of the sea to become dry 

land has really been witnessed so often and on such 

a scale as to qualify it for a vera causa available in 

sound philosophy 

 to take another instance likewise drawn 
from the same deservedly popular science — the 
fact of a great change in the general diraate of 
large tracts of the globe if not of the whole earth 
and of a diminution of general temperature having

former ages enclosed in the strata various causes 
for such diminution of temperature have been as

gradually cooled from absolute fusion some regard 
the immensely superior activity of former volcanoes 
and consequent more copious communication of in 
ternal heat to the surface in former ages as the 
cause neither of these can be regarded as real 
causes in the sense here intended for we do not 
know that the globe has so cooled from fusion nor 
are we sure that such supposed greater activity of 
former than of present volcanoes really did exist 
 a cause possessing the essential requisites of a

in the varying influence of the distribution of land

such distribution in the lapse of ages by the dra 
dation of the old continents and the devation of 
mew being a demonstrated fact and the influence 
of such a change on the dimates c particular re 
gions if not of the whole globe being a perfectly 
t conclusion from what we know of continental 
insular and oceanic climates by actual observation 
here then we have at least a cause on which a 
philosopher may consent to reason though whether 
the changes actually going on are such as to warrant 
the whole extent of the conclusion or are even 
taking place in the right direction may be con 
sidered as undecided till the matter has been more 
thoroughly examined 

 to this we may add another which 
has likewise the essential characters of a vera 
tanmy in the astronomical fact of the actual slow 
diminution of the eccentricity of the earths orbit 
round the sun and which as a general one affect 
ing the mean iemperaiute of the whole globe and 
as one of which the effect is both inevitable and 
aosceptihle to a certain degree of exact estimation 
ieserves consideration it is evident that the 
ifiean temperature of the whole surface of the 
globe in so far as it is maintained by the action 
€ the sun at a higher degree than it would have 
were the sun extinguished must depend on the 
mean quantity of the suns rays which it receives or 
which comes to the same thing on the toted quantity 
received in a given invariable time and the length 
of the year being unchangeable in all the fluctu 
ations of the planetary system it follows that the

tota €mnuai amount of solar radiation will deter 
mine kbtens paribus the general climate of the 
earth now it is not difficult to show that this 
amount is inversely proportional to the minor axis 
of the ellipse described by the earth about the 
sun regarded as slowly variable and that there 
fore the major axis remaining as we know it to be 
constant and the orbit being actually in a state of 
approach to a circle and consequently the minor 
axis being on the increase the mean annual amount 
of solar radiation received by the whole earth must 
be actually on the decrease we have here there 
fore an evident real cause of sufficient univer 
sality and acting in the right diredumy to account 
for the phenomenon its adequacy is another 
consideration 

 whenever therefore any phenomenon pre 
sents itself for explanation we naturally seek in 
the first instance to refer it to some one or other 
of those real causes which experience has shown to 
exist and to be efficacious in producing similar 
phenomena in this attempt our probability of 
success will of course mainly depend st on the 
number and variety of causes experience has placed 
at our disposal y on our habit of applying them 
to the explanation of natural phenomena and sdly 
on the number of analogous phenomena we can 
collect which have either been explained or whidi 
admit of explanation by some one or other of thoie 
causes and the closeness of their analogy with that 
in question 

 the reader will find this subject further developed in a 
paper lately communicated to the geological society 



ov natubal philosophy f 

 here uien we see the eat importance 
of possessing a stock of analogous instances or phe 
nomena which class themselves with that under 
consideration the explanation of one among whidi 
may naturally be expected to lead to that of all 
die rest if the analogy of two phenomena be 
very dose and striking while at the same time die 
cause of one is very obvious it becomes scarcely 
possible to reftwe to admit the action of an analogous 
cause in the other though hot so obvious in itself 
for instance when we see a stone whirled round in 
a sling describing a circular orbit round the hand 
keeping die string stretched and flying away the 
moment it breaks we never hesitate to rard it as 
retained in its orbit by the toision of the string 
that is by a force directed to the centre for we 
el that we do really exert such a force we have 
here la dared percfhan of the cause when 
therefore we see a great body like the moon cir 
culating round the earth and not flying off we 
cnumot help believing it to be prevented from so 
doing not indeed by a material tie but by that 
which operates in the other case through the in 
termectium of the string — z farce directed con 
standy to the centre it is thus that we are con 
tinually acquiring a knowledge of the existence 
of causes acting under drcumstances of such con 
cealment as effectually to prevent their direct dis 
covery 

s in general we must observe that motion 
wherever produced or changed invariably points 
out the existence of force as its cause and diua 
the forces of nature become known and measured

by the motions they produce thus the foret of 
magnetisin becomes known by the deviation pro 
duced by iron in a compass needle or by a needle 
leaping up to a magnet held over it as certainly as 
by that adhesion to it when in contact and at rest 
which requires force to break the connection and 
thus the currents produced in the surface of a quan 
tity of quicksilver electrified under a conducting 
fiuid have pointed out the existence and directiob 
of forces of enormous intensity developed by die 
electric circuit of which we should not odierwise 
have had the least suspicion 

 but when the cause of a phenomenon nei 
tlier presents itself obviously on the consideration of 
the phenomenon itself nor is as it were forced on 
our intention by a case fa strong analogy subh as 
above described we have then no resource but in 
a deliberate assemblage of all the parallel instances 
we can muster that is to the formation of a class 
of foots having the fenomenon in question for a 
head of classification and to a search among the 
individuals of this dass for some other common 
points of agreement among which die canse will 
of necessity be found but if more dian one canse

ef eaiperiment as distinguished from mere passive 
observation we make an experiment of the cru 
cial kind when we form combinations and put in 
action causes from which some particular one shall 
be deliberately exduded and some other purposely 
admitted and by the agreement or disieement 
of the resulting phenomena with those of the dass 
under examination we decide our judgment 

is when we would lay down general rulea 
for guiding and facilitating our search among a 
great mass of assembled facts for their common 
causey we must have regard to the characters of 
that rdation which we intoid by cause and effect 
now these are 
ist invariable connection and in particular in 
variable antecedence of the cause and conse 
quence of the effect unless prevented by some 
counteracting cause but it must be observed 
tiiat in a great number of natural phenomena 
the effect is produced gradually while the cause 
often goes on increasing in intensi so that 
the antecedence of the one and consequence of 
the other becomes difficidt to trace though it 
really exists on the other hand the efiect 
often fbllows the cause so instantaneously that 
the interval cannot be perceived in conse 
quence of thisit is sometimes difficult to decide 
of two phenomena constancy accompanying one 
another which is cause or which effect

of ihe cause unless some other canse be ca 
pable of producing the same effiect

the increased or diminished intensity of the 
cause in cases which admit of increase and di 
minution 

th proportionali of the effect to its cause in 
all cases cidireci uninyxded action 

th reversal of the effect with that of the causes 

 from these characters we are led to the 
following observations which may be considered as 
so many propositions readily applicable to particular 
cases or rules of philosophizing we condud 
st that if in our group of cts there be one in 
which any assigned peculiarity or attendant cir 
cumstance is wantmg or opposite such peculiarly 
cannot be the cause we seek 

 d that any circumstance in whidi all 
the facts without exception agree majf be the 
cause in question or if not at least a collateral 
ect of the same cause if there be but one 
such point of agreement this possibili becomes a 
certainty and on the other hand if there be more 
than one they may be concurrent causes 

 d that we are not to deny the existence 
of a cause in vour of which we have a unanimoob 
agreement of strong analces though it may not be 
apparent how such a cause can produce the effect 
or even though it may be difficult to conceive its 
existence under the circumstances of the case in 
such cases we should rather appeal to experience 
when possible than decide priori against the causes 
and try whether it cannot be made apparent 

 for instance seeing the sun vividly luml 
nous every analogy leads us to condude it intensely 
hot how heat can produce light we know not 



of natural philosophy 

and how such a heat can be maintained we can 
form no conception yet we are not therefore 
entitled to denj the inference 

 th that contrary or opposing facts are 
equally instructive for the discovery of causes with 
vouiable ones 

 for instance when air is confined with 
moistened iron filings in a dose vessel over water 
its bulk is diminished by a certain portion of it 
being abstracted and combining with the iron pro 
ducing rusl and if the remainder be examined 
it is found that it will not support flame or animal 
life this contrary fact shows that the cause of the 
support of flame and animal life is to be looked for 
in that part of the air which the iron abstracts and 
which rusts it 

 th that causes wfll very firequently be 
come obvious by a mere arrangement of our fiuts in 
the order of intensity in which some peculiar quality 
subsists though not of necessity because counter 
acting or modifying causes may be at the same 
time in action 

 for example sound consists in impulses 
communicated to our ears by the air if a series of 
impulses of equal force be communicated to it at 
equal intervals of time at first in slow succession 
and by degrees more and more rapidly we hear at 
£rst a rattling noise then a low murmur and then a 
lium which by degrees acquires the character of a 
musical note rising higher and higher in acuteness till 
its pitch becomes too high for the ear to follow and 
fitnn this correspondence between the pitch of the 
xicte and the rapidity of succession of the impulse we 



 discourse on the stuby 

conclude that our sensation c the different pitches 
of musical notes originates in the different rapidities 
with which their impulses are communicated to our 
ears 

ii th that such counteracting or modifying 
causes may subsist unperceived and anntd the 
effects of the cause we seek in instances which 
but for their action would have come into our class 
of favourable facts and that therefore exceptions 
may often be made to disappear by removing or 
allowing for such counteracting causes this remark 
becomes of the greatest importance when as is 
often the case a single striking exception stands 
out as it were against an otherwise unanimous array 
of facts in favovir of a certain cause 

 thus in chemistry the alkaline quality of 
the alkaline and earthy bases is found to be due to 
the presence of oxygen combined with one or other 
of a peculiar set of metals ammonia is however 
a violent outstanding exception such as here alluded 
to being a compound of azote and hydrogen but 
there are almost certain indications that this excep 
tion is not a real one but assumes that appearance 
in consequence of some modifying cause not under 
stood 

 th if we can either find produced by 
nature or produce designedly for ourselves two in 
stances which agree exacdy in all but one particular 
and differ in that one its influence in producing 
the phenomenon if it have any miut thereby be 
rendered sensible if that particular be present 
in one instance and wanting altogether in the 
other the production or nonproduction of the phe

a m i rar um m bk the two caaes and the effect be

oomdiids dut it acts as a c oncuif t nt caose or

ifmf emot be done we may perhaps be able ta

 discourse on the study 

 ih complicated phenomena in which 
several causes concurring opposing or quite in 
dependent of each other operate at once so as 
to produce a compound effect may be simplified by 
subducting the effect of all the known causes as 
well as the nature of the case permits either by 
deductive reasoning or by appeal to experience and 
thus leaving as it were a residtud phenomenon to be 
explained it is by this process in fact that 
science in its present advanced state is chiefly pro 
moted most of the phenomena which nature pre 
sents are very complicated and when the efiects of 
all known causes are estimated with exactness and 
subducted the residual facts are constantly appear 
ing in the form of phenomena altogether new and 
leading to the most important conclusions 

 for example the return of the comet pre 
dieted by professor encke a great many times in 
succession and the general good agreement of its 
calculated with its observed place during any one 
of its periods of visibility would lead us to say that its 
gravitation towards the sun and planets b the sole 
and sufficient cause of all the phenomena of its 
orbitual motion but when the effect of this cause 
is strictly calculated and subducted from the cib 
served motion there is found to remain behind a 
residual phenomenon which would never have been 
otherwise ascertained to exist which is a small 
anticipation of the time of its reappearances or a 
diminution of its periodic time which cannot be 
accounted or by gravity and whose cause is there 
fore to be enquired into such an anticipation 
would be caused by the resistance of a medium 



op natural philosophy 

seminated through the celestial regions and as 
there are other good reasons for believing this to 
be a vera causoy it has therefore been ascribed to 
such a resistance 

 this th observation is of such import 
ance in science that we shall exemplify it bj an 
other instance or two m arago having suspended 
a magnetic needle by a silk thread and set it 
in vibration observed that it came much sooner 
to a state of rest when suspended over a plate of 
copper than when no such plate was beneath 
it now in both cases there were two vera 
causes why it should come at length to rest viz the 
resistance of the air which opposes and at length 
destroys au motions performed in it and the want 
of perfect mobility in the silk thread but the 
effect of these causes being exactly known by the 
observation made in the absence of the copper and 
being thus allowed for and subducted a residual 
phenomenon appeared in the fact that a retarding 
influence was exerted by the copper itself and this 
ct once ascertained speedily led to the knowledge 
of an entirely new and unexpected class of relations 
to add one more instance if it be true as m 
fourrier considers it demonstrated to be that the 
celestial regions have a temperature independent 
of the sun not greatly inferior to that at which 
quicksilver congeals and much superior to some de 
grees of cold which have been artificially produced 
two causes suggest themselves one is that assigned 
bj the author above mentioned the radiation of tb 
stars another may be proposed in the ether or elauic 
medium mentioned in the last section whick the

phenomena of light and the resistance of cometi 
give us reason to believe fills all space and vrhiot 
in analogy to all the elastic media known may he 
supposed to possess a temperature and a qecific 
heat of its own which it is capdile of coimnuni 
cating to bodies surrounded by it now if we 
consider that the heat radiated by the sun follows 
the same proportion as its light and rard it as 
reasonable to admit with respect to stellar heat 
what holds good of solar the effect of stellar radia 
tion in maintaining a temperature in space should 
be as much inferior to that of the radiation of the 
sun as the ht of a moonless midnight is to that 
of an equatorial noon that is to say almost incon 
ceivably smaller allowing then the full effect 
for this cause there would still remain a great 
residuum due to the presence of the ether 

 many of the new elements of cheoeustry 
have been detected in the investigation of reskbud 
pkenomeneu thus arfwedson discovered lithia by 
perceiving an excess of weight in the sulphate pro 
duced from a small portion of what he considered as 
magnesia present in a mineral he had analysed it 
is on this principle too that the smau concentnued 
residues €fgreatoperaiwns in the arts are almost sure 
to be the lurking places of new chemical ingredients 
witness iodine brome selenium and the new metab 
accompanying platina in the experiments of wol 
laston and tennant it was a happy thought of 
glauber to examine what every body else threw 
way 

tl finally we have to observe that the de 
tectiion of a possible cause by the comparison ot 



or natural phiusoput 

eabembled casesy nutii lead to one of two things 
either let the detection of a real cause and of ita 
manner of aicing so as to furnish a complete ex 
planation of the fiicts or dly the establishment 
flf an abstract law of nature pointing out two phe 
nomena of a general kind as invariably connected 
and asserting that where one is there the other 
win always be found such invariable ommection 
is itsdf a phenomenon of a higher wder than any 
particular ct and when many such are discovered 
we may again proceed to classify combine and 
examine them with a view to the detection af their 
causes or the discovery of still more general laws 
and so on without end 

s let us now exemplify this inductive search 
finr a cause by one general example suppose dew 
were the phenomenon proposed whose cause we 
would know in the first place we must separate 
dew from rain and the moisture of fogs and limit the 
application of the term to what is really meant 
which is the spontaneous appearance of moisture on 
substances exposed in the open air when no rain or 
visible wet is falling now here we have analogous 
phenomena in the moisture which bedews a cold 
metal or stone when we breathe upon it that which 
appears on a glass of water fresh from the well in hot 
weather that which appears on the inside of windows 
when sudden rain or hail chills the external air that 
which runs down our walls when after a long frost a 
warm moist thaw ixmes on all these instance 
agree in one point rule § the coldness of 
the object dewed in comparison with the air in 
contact with it 



 discourse on the study 

 but in the case of the night dew is this a 
real cause — is it a fact that the object dewed is odder 
than the air certainly not one would at first be 
inclined to say for what is to make it so but the 
analogies are cogent and unanimous and therefore 
pursuant to rule § we are not to discard their 
indications and besides the experiment is easy we 
have only to lay a thermometer in contact with the 
dewed substance and hang one at a little distance 
above it out of reach of its influence the experi 
ment has been therefore made the question has 
been asked and the answer has been invariably in the 
 affirmative whenever an object contracts dew it is 
i colder than the air here then we have an mvo 
 riable concomitant circumstance but is this chill an 
effect of dew or its cause that dews are accom 
panied with a chill is a common remark but vulgar 
prejudice would make the cold the effect rather 
thm the cause we must therefore collect more 
facts or which comes to the same thing vary the 
circumstances since every instance in which the 
circumstances differ is a fresh fact and especiady 
we must note the contrary or negative cases ride 
 § t e where no dew is produced 

 now st no dew is produced on the sur 
face of polished metalsy but it is very copiously on 
glass both exposed with their faces upwards and 
in some cases the under side of a horizontal plate of 
glass is also dewed which last circumstance by 
rule § excludes the fm of moisture from 
the sky in an invisible form which would natur 
ally suggest itself as a cause in the cases of 
polished metal and polished glass the contrast 



or itatural phiiosotht 

mm evldentlj that the suhsiance has much to do 
itb the phenomenon therefore let the suhstance 
akmebe diversified as much as possible by exposing 
polished surfaces of various kinds this done a 
teak tf iniensi becomes obvious rule § i 
itiose polished substances are found to be most 
strongly dewed which conduct heat worst while 
those whkh conduct well resist dew most effectunlly 
here we encounter a law of the first degree of gene 
rally but if we expose rough surfaces instead of 
polished we sometimes find this law interfered with 
rvle § thus roughened iron especially if 
painted over or blackened becomes dewed sooner 
than varnished paper the kind of surface therefore 
has a great influence expose then the same ma 
terial in very diversified states as to surce rule 
§ and another scale of intensity becomes at onoe 
apparent those surfaces which part wuh their hmi 
most readily by radiation are found to contract 
dew most copiously and thus we have detected 
another law of the same generality with the former 
by a comparison of two classes of facts one relating 
to dew the other to the radiation of heat from 
surces again the influence ascertained to exist 
of substance and surface leads us to consider that of 
texture and hare again we are presented on trial 
with remarkable differences and with a third scale 
qf tntensity pointing out substances of a dose firm 
textinre such as stones metals c as imfavour 
abhey but those of a loose one as doth wool vdvet

 lastly among the negative instances 
§ it is observed that dew is never copiously 
deposited in situations much screened from the open 
sky and not at all in a cloudy night but if the 
clouds withdraw even for a few minutes and leave 
a dear opening a deposition of dew presently begins 
and goes on increasing here then a cause is dis 
tinctly pointed out by its antecedence to the effect 
in question a dear view of the doudless 
sky then is an essential condition or which comes 
to the same thing clouds or surrounding objects act 
as opposing causes this is so much the case that 
dew formed in clear intervals will oflen even eva 
porate again when the sky becomes thickly overcast 
rule § 

 when we now come to assemble these partial 
inductions so as to raise from them a general con 
dusion we consider st that all the condusions we 
have come to have a reference to that first general 
fact — the cooling of the exposed surface of the body 
dewed below the temperature of the air those 
surfaces which part with their heat outwards most 
readily and have it supplied from within most 
slowly will of coiurse become coldest if there be an 
opportunity for their heat to escape and not be 
restored to them from without now a dear sky a 
fords such an opportunity it is a law well known 
to those who are conversant with the nature of heal 
that heat is constantly escaping from all bodies in 
rays or by radiahony but is as constantly restored 



of natural philosophy 

to them by the similar radiation of others surround 
ing them clouds and siurounding objects therefore 
act as opposing causes by replacing the whole or a 
great part of the heat so radiated away which can 
escape effectually without being replaced only 
through openings into infinite space thus at 
length we arrive at the general proximate cause of 
dew in the cooling of the dewed surce by radia 
tion faster than its heat can be restored to it 
by communication with the ground or by counter 
radiation so as to become colder than the air and 
thereby to cause a condensation of its moisture 

 we have purposely selected this theory 
of dew first developed by the late dr wells as one 
of the most beautiful specimens we can call to mind 
of inductive experimental enquiry lying within a 
moderate compass it is not possible in so brief a 
space to do it justice but we earnestly recommend 
his work a short and very entertaining one for 
rosal to the student of natural philosophy as a 
fiodel with which he will do well to become fa 
iar 

 in the analysis above given the formation 
of dew is referred to two more general phenomena 
the radiation of heat and the condensation of in 
visible vapour by cold the cause of the former 
is a much higher enquiry and may be said indeed 
to be totally unknown that of the latter actually 
forms a most important branch of physical enquiry 
in such a case when we reason upwards till we reach 
an tdtimate fact we regard a phenomenon as fidly ex 
plained as we consider the branch of a tree to

as a rivulet retams its importance and itft nfone tiu 
lost in some larger tributary or in the main river 
which delivers it into the ocean this however al 
ways supposes that oa a reconsideration of the case 
we see clearly how the admission of such a faot 
with all its attendant laws will perfectly accoimt 
for ewripaftieular — as well those which in the dif 
ferent stages of the inductionhaveledus to a know 
ledge of it aa those which we had neglected or 
considered less minutely than the rest but had 
weno preyioubknowlece of the radiation of heat 
this same induction would have made it known to 
us and duly considered might have led to the 
knowledge of many of its laws 

 iii the study of nature we must not 
therefore be scrupulous as to haw we reach to a 
knowledge of such general facts provided only 
we veriiythem careiy when once detected we 
must be content to seize them wherever they are to 
be found and this brings us to consider the veri 
ficaion of inductions 

 if incur induction every individual caae 
has actually been present to our minds we are sure 
that it will find itself duly rqsresenied in our fined coq 
dusion but this is impossible for such cases as 
were tmknawn to us and hardly ever happens even 
with all the known cases for such is the tendency 
of the human mind to speculation that on the least 
idea of an analogy between a few phenomeni it 
leaps forward as it were to a cause or law to the 
temporary neglect of all the rest so that in bacu 



or natural philosophy 

ahnost all our prindpal indactionsmufltbe regarded 
as a series of ascents and descents and of condnsions 
mi a few cases yerified by trial on many 

 whenever therefore we think we have 
been led by induction to the knowledge of the proxi 
mate cttose of a phenomenon or of a lawdf ntiture our 
niskt business is to examine deliberately and serieuim 
all the tbbcr we have collected of its occurrence in 
order to satisfy ourselves that they are explicable 
by our cause or £urly included in the expression 
f our tew and in case any exception occurs it must 
be ekrefiilly noted and set aside for rexamination 
nt a more advanced period when possibly the cause 
of exception may appear and the exception itself 
by allowing for the effect of that cause be brought 
over to be side of our induction but should ex 
eepticms prove numerous and various in their fea 
tmeoy our ith in the conclusion will be propor 
tidnally shien and at all events its importance 
lessened by the destruction of its universality 

s in the conduct of this verification we are to 
condenr whether the cause or law to which we are 
ochiducied be one already known and recognised as 
a more general one whose nature is well understood 
and of whidi the phenomenon in question is but one 
more case in addition to tliose already known or 
hdi€r it be one less general less known or alto 
gether new in tiie latter case our verification will 
sdffice if it merely shows that all the cases con

former tiie process of verification is of a much more 
severe and definite kind we must trace the action

fied by au the circumstances of each case we must 
estimate its effects and show that nothing unex 
plained remains behind at least in so far as the 
presence of unknown modifying causes is not coo 
cemed 

 now this is precisely the sort of process in 
which residual phenomena such as spoken of in art 
 may be expected to occur if our induction 
be really a valid and a comprehensive one whaiever 
remams imexplained in the comparison of its con 
clusion with particular cases under all their circum 
stances is such a phenomenon and comes in its 
turn to be a subject of inductive reasoning to dis 
cover its cause or laws it is thus that we may be 
said to witness facts with the eyes of reason and it 
is thus that we are continually attaining a know 
ledge of new phenomena and new laws which lie 
beneath the surface of things and give rise to tbe 
creation of fresh branches of science more and 
more remote from common observation 

 physical astronomy affords numerous and 
splendid instances of this the law for examj 
which asserts that the planets are retained in their 
orbits about the sun and satellites about their pri 
maries by an attractive force decreasing as the 
square of the distances increases comes to be veri 
fied in each particular case by deducing from it 
the exact motions which under the circumstancefl 
ought to take place and comparing them with feet 
this comparison while it verifies in general the 
existence of the law of gravitation as supposed and 
its adequacy to explain all the principal motions 
of every body in the system yet leaves some

small deviations in those of the planets and some 
yj considerable ones in that of the moon and other 
satellites still miaccounted for residual phenomena 
which still remain to be traced up to causes by 
farther examining these their causes have at length 
been ascertained and found to consist in the mutual 
actions of the planets on each other and the dis 
turbing influence of the sun on the motions of the 
•satellites 

 but a law of nature has not that dee of 
generality which fits it for a steppingstone to 
greater inductions unless it be umversat in its ap 
•pbcation we cannot rely on its enabling us to 
extend our views beyond the circle of instances 
from which it was obtained unless we have already 
had experience of its power to do so unless it 
actually has enabled us before trial to say what will 
take place in cases analogous to those originally 
contemplated unless in diort we have studiously 
placed ourselves in the situation of its antagonists 
and even perversely endeavoured to find exceptions 
to it without success it is in the precise pro 
portion that a law once obtained endures this 
extreme severity of trial that its value and im 
portance are to be estimated and our next step in 
the verification of an induction must therefore con 
sist in extending its application to cases not origin 
ally contemplated in studiously varying the cir 
cumstances under which our causes act with a view 
to ascertain whether their effect is general and in 
puiing the application of our laws to extreme 
cases

 the surest and best diaracteristic of a 
wellfounded and extensive induction however is 
when verifications of it spring up as it were 
spontaneouslj into notice from quarters where 
they might be least expected or even among 
instances of that very kind which were at first 
considered hostile to them evidence of this kind 
is irresistible and compels assent with a weight 
which scarcely any other possesses to give an ex 
ample m mitscherlich had announced a law to this 
effect — that the chemical elements of which all 
bodies consist are susceptible of being classified 
in distinct groups which he termed uomorphous 
groups and that these groups are so related 
that when similar combinations are formed of indi 
viduals belonging to two three or more of them 
such combinations will crystallize in the same geo 
metrical forms to this curious and important 
law there appeared a remarkable exception ac 
cording to professor mitscherlich the arsenic and 
phosphoric acids are similar combinations coming 
under the meaning of his law and their combin 
ations with soda and water forming the salts 
known to chemists under the names of arseniate 
and phosphate of soda ought if the law were 
general to crystallize in identical shapes the 
fact however was understood to be otherwise 
but lately mr clarke a british chemist having 
examined the two salts attentively ascertained 
the ct that their compositions deviate essentiadjr 
from that similarity which m mitscherlichs law 
requires and that therefore the exception in 
question disappears this was something bat 



of natubal philosophy 

pursuing the subject airther the same ingenious 
enquirer happily succeeded in producing a new phos 
phate of soda differing from that generally known 
in containing a different proportion of water and 
agreeing in composition exactly with the arseniate 
the crystals of this new salt when examined 
were found by him to be precisely identical in form 
with those of the arseniate thus verifying in a 
most striking and totally unexpected manner the 
law in question or as it is called the law of 
isomorphism 

 unexpected and peculiarly striking con 
firmaticms of inductive laws frequently occur in the 
form of residual phenomena in the course of inves 
tigations of a widely different nature from those 
which gave rise to the inductions themselves a 
very elant example may be cited in the unex 
pected confirmation of the law of the developement 
of heat in elastic fluids by compression which is 
afforded by the phenomena of sound the enquiry 
into the cause of sound had led to conclusions re 
ecting its mode of propagation from which its 
velocity in the air could be precisely calculated 
the calculations were performed but when com 
pared with fact though the agreement was quite 
sufficient to show the general correctness of the 
caofie and mode of propagation assigned yet 
the whole velocity could not be shown to arise 
from this theory there was still a residual velo 
city to be accounted for which placed dynamical 
liilosophers for a long time in a great dilemma 
at length la place struck on the happy idea that 
this might arise from the heat developed in the act 



 discourse on the study 

of that condensation whidi necessaiil j takes place at 
evtry yibiation by which sound is conveyed the 
matter iras sulijected to exact calculation and the 
result was at once the complete explanation of the 
residual phenomenon and a striking confirmation 
of the general law of the developement of heat by 
compression under drcumstances lyond artificial 
imitation 

 in extending our inductions to cases not 
originally contemplated there is one step which 
always strikes the mind with peculiar force and with 
such a sensation of novelty and surprise as often 
gives it a weight beyond its due philosophic value 
it is the transition from the little to the great and 
woe vendy butiespedally the former it is so beau 
tiful to see for instance an ckperiment perfbrmed 
in a watchglass or before a blowpipe succeed in a 
great manufiictory on many tons of matter or in the 
jbosom of a volcano upon millions of cubic fathoms 
of lava that wealmost forget that thesegreat masses 
are made vp of watchglassfuls and blowpipe 
beads we see the enormous intervals between the 
tftars and planets ci the heavens which afibrd room

groups resenibling bodies of a substantial appear 
ance iiaving form and outlme yet we recoil with 
incredulous surprise when we are asked wfy we 



of natubal philosopht 

casnot conceive the atoms of a grain of sand to be 
as remote from each other proportionallj to their 
sizes as the stars of tbe firmament and why 
there may not be going on in that iktle microcosm 
processes as complicated and wonderful as those of 
the great world aroand us yet the student who 
makes any progress in natural philosophy will en 
counter munbisrless cases in whidi this transfer of 
ideas from the one extreme of magnitude to the 
other will be called feiti he will find for instance 
the phenomena oftue propagation of winds referred 
to die same laws which regulate the propagation 
of motiods throu the smallest masses of air those 
of lightning assimilated to the mere communication 
of an electric sparky and those of earthquakes to the 
tremovsof a stretched wire in short he must lay 
his account to finding the disttnetion of great and 
little altogether annihilated in nature and it is well 
for man that such is the case and that the same 
lawb which he can disoorer and verify in his own 
circumscribed sphere of power should prove avail 
able to him when he comes to ajy them on the 
greatest scale since it is thus only that he is en 
abled to become an exciting cause in operations of 
any considendble magnitude and tojvindicate his 
importance in creation 

 but die business of induction does not 
end here its final result must be fohowed out into 
all its consequences and applied to all those cases 
which seem evi remotely to bear upon tiie sub

of causes becomes a means of fresh attack with new

former phenomena which have resisted previous 
efforts it can hardlj he pressed forcibly enough 
on the attention of the student of nature that there 
is scarcely any natural phenomenon which can be 
fully aid completely explained in all its circum 
stances without a union of several perhaps of all 
the sciences hie great phenomena of astronomy 
indeed may be considered exceptions but this is 
merely because their scale is so vast that one only 
of the most widely extendingorces of nature takes 
the lead and all diose agents whbse sphere of action 
is limited to narrower bounds and which determine 
the production of phenomena nearer at hand are 
thrown into the back ground and become merged 
and lost in comparative insignificance but in the 
more intimate phenomena which surround us it q 
far otherwise into what a complication of different 
branches of science are we not led by the considep 
ation of such a ptienomenon as rain for instance 
or flame or a thousand others which are constantly 
going on before our eyes hence it is hardly 
possible to arrive at the knowledge of a law of 
any degree of generality in any branch of science 
but it immediately furnishes us with a means of 
extending our knowledge of innumerable others 
the most remote from the point we set out from 
so that when once embarked in any physical re 
search it is impossible for any one to predict where 
it may ultimately lead him 

 this remark rather belongs to the inverse 
or deductive process by which we pursue laws into 
their remote consequences but it is very important 
to observci that the successful process of scientific 



of natural philosophy 

enquiry demands continually the alternate use of 
both the inductive and deductive method the path 
by which we rise to knowledge must be made smooth 
and beaten in its lower steps and often ascended and 
descended before we can scale our way to any emi 
nence much less dimb to the summit hie achieve 
ment is too great for a single effort stations must 
be established and communications kept open with 
all below to quit metaphor there is nothing so 
instructiye or so likely to lead to the acquisition of 
general views as this pursuit of the consequences of 
a law once arrived at into every subject where it 
may seem likely to have an influence hie dis 
covery of a new law of nature a new ultimate ct 
or one that even temporarily puts on that appear 
ance is like the discovery of a new element in che 
mistry thus selenium was hardly discovered by 
berzelius in the vitriol works of fahlun when it 
presently made its iqpearance in the sublimates of 
stromboli and the rare and curious products of the 
hungarian mines and thus it is with every new 
law or general fact it is hardly announced before 
its traces are found every where and every one is 
astonished at its having so long remained concealed 
ajid hence it happens that unexpected lights are 
ed at length over parts of science that had been 
abandoned in despair and given over to hopeless 
obscurity 

 the verification of quemtuxuive laws has 
been already spoken of but their importance in 
physical science is so very great inasmuch as they 
alone afford a handle to strict mathematical deduc 
tive application that something ought to be said of

the nature of the inductions by which they are t 
be arrived at in their simplest or least general 
stages of which alone we speak at present they 
usually express some numerical relation between 
two quantities dependent on each other either as 
collateral effects o£ a common cause or as the 
amount of its effect under given numerical circum 
stances or daieu fbr example the law of refrac 
tion before noticed § expresses by a very 
simple relation the amount of angular deviation of a 
ray of light from its course when the anffk at which 
it is inclined to the refracting surface is known 
viz that the sine of the angle whjch the incident 
ray makes with a perpendicular to the surface is 
always to that of the angle made by the refracted 
ray with the sameperpendicular in a constant pro 
portion so long aathe refracting substance is the 
same to ainrive inductively at laws of this kind 
where one quantity depends on or varies um anodier 
all that is required is a series of carefbl and exact 
measures in every different state of the datmm and 
qubsiium here however the mathematical form 
of the law being of the highest importance the 
greatest attention must be given to the extreme eases 
as well as to all those points where the one quanti 
changes rapidly with a small change of the other 
the results must be set down in a table in whidi 
the datum gradually increases in magnitude from 
the lowest to the highest limit of which it is sus 

 a very curious instance of the pursuit of a law conqtleldy 
empirical into an extreme case is to be found in newtons rule £ar 
ihe dilatation of his coloured rings seen between glasaeiat gremft 
obliquities optics book il part i obs 



of natural philosophy 

ceptible it will depend then entirely on our habit 
of treating mathematical subjects how far we may 
be able to include such a table in the distinct state 
ment of a mathematical law the discovery of 
such laws is often remarkably facilitated by the 
contemplation of a class of phenomena to be noticed 
ftirther on under the head of collective instances 
see in which the nature of the mathe 
matical expression in which the law sought is com 
prehended is pointed out by the figure of some 
curve brought under inspection by a proper mode 
of experimenting 

 after all unless our induction embraces 
a series of cases which absolutely include the 
whole scale of variation of which the quantities 
in question admit the matliematical expression so 
obtained cannot be depended upon as the true one 
and if the scale actually embraced be small the 
extension of laws so derived to extreme cases will 
in all probability be exceedingly fallacious for 
example air is an elastic fluid and as such if 
enddsed in a confined space and squeezed its bulk 
diininishes now from a great number of trials made 
in cases where the air has been compressed into a 
half a third c even as far as a fiftieth of its bulk 
or less it has been concluded that the density of 
air is proportional to the compressing force or the 
bulk it occupies inversely as that force and when 
the air is rarefied by taking off part of its natural 
pressure the same is found to be the case within 
very extensive limits yet it is impossible that this 
should be strictly or mathematically speaking the 
true law for if it were so there could be no limit 



 discourse on the study 

to the condensation of air while yet we have the 
strongest analogies to show that long before it had 
reached any very enormous pith the air would be 
reduced into a liquid an even perhaps if pressed 
yet more violently into a solid form 

 laws thus derived by the direct process 
of including in mathematical formulae the results 
of a greater or less number of measurements are 
called empirical laws a good example of such 
a law is that given by dr young phil trans i 
for the decrement of life or the law of mortality 
empirical laws in this state are evidently unverified 
indiictionsf and are to be received and reasoned on 
with the utmost reserve no confidence can ever 
be placed in them beyond the limits of the data from 
which they are derived and even within those li 
mits they require a special and severe scrutiny to 
examine how nearlt they do represent the observed 
facts that is to say whether in the comparison of 
their results with the observed quantities the dif 
ferences are such as may fairly be attributed to error 
of observation when so carefiilly examined they 
become however most valuable and frequently 
when afterwards verified theoreticauy by a deduc 
tive process as will be explained in our next chap 
ter turn out to be rigorous laws of nature and afford 
the noblest and most convincing supports of which 
theories themselves are susceptible the finest 
instances of this kind are the great laws of the 
planetary motions deduced by kepler entirely m 
a comparison of observations with each other with 
no assistance from theory these laws viz thai 
the planets move in ellipses round the sun that

€ch describes about the suns centre equal areas in 
equal times and that in the orbits of different pla 
nets the squares of the periodical times are propor 
tbnal to the cubes of the distances were the results 
of inconceivable labour of calculation and compari 
son but they amply repaid the labour bestowed 
on them by affording afterwards the most condusive 
and unanswerable proofs of the newtonian system 
on the other hand when empirical laws are unduly 
rdied on beyond the limits of the observations from 
idiich they were deduced there is no more fertile 
source of fatal mistakes the formulae which have 
been empirically deduced for the elasticity of steam 
till very recently and those for the resistance of 
fluids and other similar suljects have almost inva 
riably failed to support the theoretical structures 
whicli have been erected on them 

 it is a remarkable and happy ct that the 
shortest and most direct of all inductions should 
be that which has led at once and almost by 
a single step to the highest of au natural laws — 
we mean those of motion and force nothing can 
be more simple precise and general than the 
enunciation of these laws and as we have once 
before observed their application to particular facts 
in the descending or deductive method is limited 
by nothing but the limited extent of our mathe 
matics it would seem then that dynamical science 
were taken thenceforward out of the pale of in 
duction and transformed into a matter of absolute 
d priori reasoning as much as geometry and so it 
would be were our mathematics perfect and all the

the case that in many of the most interesting 
branches of dynamical enquiry they leave us com 
pletely at a loss in what relates to the motions of 
fluids for instance this is severely felt we can 
include our problems it is true in algebraical equa 
tions and we can demonstrate that they caniam 
the solutions but the equations themselves are so 
intractable and present such insuperable difficulties 
that they often leave us quite as much in the dark 
as before but even were these difficulties over 
come recourse to experience must still be had to 
establish the data on which particular applications 
are to depend and although mathematical analy 
sis affords very powerful means of rqnvsenting in 
general terms the data of any proposed case and 
ciertcardsy by comparison of its results with ct 
determining tvhat those data must be to explain 
the observed phenomena still in any mode of 
considering the matter an appeal to experience in 
every particular instance of application is unavoid 
able even when the general principles are regarded 
as sufficiently established without it now in all 
such cases of difficulty we must recur to our in 
ductive processes and regard the branches of dy 
namical science where this takes place as purely 
experimental by this we gain an inunense ad 
vantage viz that in all those points of them where 
the abstract daiamical principles do afford distinct 
conclusions we obtain verifications for our induc 
tions of the highest and finest possible kind when 
we work our way up inductively to one of these 
results we cannot hdp feeling the strongest 
ance of the validity of the induction

 the necessity of this appeal to experiment 
in every thing relating to the motions of fluids on 
the large scale has long been felt newton himself 
who laid the first foundations of hydrodynamical 
science so this branch of dnqamics is called dis 
tmctly perceived it and set the example o£ laborious 
and exact experiments on their resistance to motion 
and other particulars venturi bernoulli and 
many others have applied the method of experiment 
to the motions of fluids in pipes and canals and 
recently the brothers weber have published an ela 
borate and excellent experimental enquiry into the 
phenomena of waves one of the greatest and most 
successful attempts however to bring an important 
and till then very obscure branch of dnqamical 
enquiry back to the dominion of experiment has 
been made by chladni and savart in the case of

 discourse on the study 

of bacon by which he understands characteristic 
phenomena selected from the great miscellaneous 
mass of facts which occur in nature and which by 
their number indistinctness and complication tend 
rather to confuse than to direct the mind in its 
search for causes and general heads of induction 
phenomena so selected on account of some pecu 
karly fisrcible way in which they strike the reason 
and impress us with a kind of sense of causatioo 
or a particular aptitude for generalization he con 
siders and justly as holding a kind of prerogative 
dignity and claiming our first and especial attentioa 
in physical enquiries 

 we have already observed that in form 
ing inductions it will most commonly happen that 
we are led to our conclusions by the especial 
force of some two or three strongly impressive 
facts rather than by affording the whole mass of 
cases a regular consideration and hence the need 
of cautious verification indeed so strong is this 
propensity of the human mind that there is hardly 
a more common thing than to find persons ready to 
assign a cause for every thing they see and in so 
doing to join things the most incongruous by ana 
logies the most fanciful this being the case it is 
evidently of great importance that these first ready 
impulses of the mind should be made on the con 
templation of the cases most likely to lead to good 
inductions the misfortune however is in natural 
philosophy that the choice does not rest with us 
we must take the instances as nature presents 
them even if we are furnished with a list of them 
in tabular order we must understand and compare 



ov statural philosophy 

them with each other before we can tell which are 
the instances thus deservecdj entitled to the highest 
consideration and after all after much labour in 
tain and groping in the dark accident or casual 
observation will present a case which strikes us at 
once with a full insight into a subject before we 
can even have time to determine to what class its 
jprenoie belongs for example the laws of crrb 
tauography were obscure and its causes still more 
so till haiiy fortimately dropped a beautiful crystal 
of calcareous spar on a stone pavement and broke 
it in piecing together the fragments he observed 
their facets not to correspond with those of the 
crystal in its entire state but to belong to another 
form and following out the hint offered by a 
 glaring mstcmce thus casuauy obtruded on his 
notice he discovered the beautiful laws of the 
deavage and the primitive forms of minerals 

 it has always appeared to us we must 
confess that the help which the classification of in 
stances under their different titles of prerogative 
affords to inductions however just such classification 
may be in itself is yet more apparent than real 
the force of the instance must be felt in the mind 
before it can be referred to its place in the system 
and before it can be either referred or appretiated 
it must be known and when it is appretiated we 
are ready enough to interweave it in our web of in 
duction without greatly troubling ourselves with 
enquiring whence it derives the weight we acknow 
ledge it to have in our decisions however since 
much importance is usually attached to this part of

j discourse on the study 

bacons work we shall here ve a few examples 
to illustrate the nature of some of his principal cases 
one of what he calls glaring instances has just 
been mentioned in these the najburej or cause en 
quired into which in this case is the cause of the 
assumption of a peculiar external form or the in 
ternal stmcture of a crystal stands naked and 
alone and this in an eminent manner or in the 
highest degree of its power no doubt such in 
stances as these are highly instructive but the 
difficulty in physics is to find uch not to perceive 
their force when found 

 the contrary of glaring are clandestine 
instances where the nature sought is exhibited 
in its weakest and most imperfect state of 
this bacon himself has given an admirable ex 
ample in the cohesion of fluids as a clandestme 
instance of the nature or quality of consistencey 
or solidity yet here again the same acute discri 
mination which enabled bacon to perceive the ana 
logy which connects fluids with solids through the 
common property of cohesive attraction would at 
the same time have enabled him to draw from it 
if properly supported every consequence necessary 
to forming just notions of the cohesive force nor 
does its reference to the class of clandestine in 
stances at all assist in bringing forward and ma 
turing the final results when however the final 
result is obtained — when our induction is complete 
and we would verify it — this class of instances is q£ 
great use being in fact frequently no other than 
that of extreme cotes such as we have already spoken 
of in § which by placuig our conclusions 



of natural philosophy 

it were in violent circumstances tryllieir temper 
and bring their vigour to the test 

 collective instances in bacons classi 
fication are no other than general facts or laws of 
some degree of generality and are themselves the 
results of induction but there is a species of col 
lective instance which bacon does not seem to have 
contemplated of a peculiarly instructive character 
and that is where particular cases are offered to our 
observation in such numbers at once as to make the 
induction of their law a matter of ocular inspection 
for example the parabolic form assumed by a jet of 
water spouted from a round hole is a couechve tn 
stanee of the velocities and directions of the motions 
of all the particles which compose it seen at onecy 
and which thus leads us without trouble to recog 
nize the law of the motion of a projectile again 
die beautim figures exhibited by sand strewed on 
tegular plates of glass or metal set in vibration 
are collective instances of an infinite number of points 
which remain at rest while the remainder of the 
plate vibrates and in consequence afford us as it 
were a sight of the law which regulates their ar 
raiement and sequence throughout the whole 
surface tlie beautifully coloured lemniscates seen 
around the optic axes of crystals exposed to polar 
ized light afford a superb example of the same 
kind pointing at once to the general mathematical 
expression of the law which regulates their pro 
duction of such collective instances as these it 
is easy to see the importance and its reason they 
lead us to a general law by an induction which 

 see phil trans 



 discourse ok the study 

offers itsielf spontaneously and thus furnish ad 
vanced points in our enquiries and when we start 
from these already a thousand steps are lost 

 a fine example of a collective instance is 
that of the system of jupiter or saturn widi its 
satellites we have here in miniature and seen 
at one view a system similar to that of the planets 
about the sun of which from the circumstance of 
our being involved in it and unfavourably situated 
for seeing it otherwise than in detail we are in 
capacitated from forming a general idea but by 
slow progressive efforts of reason accordingly the 
contemplation of the drcumjovial planets as they 
were called most materially assisted in securing 
the admission of the copemican system 

 of crucial instances we have also al 
ready spoken as affording the readiest and securest 
means of eliminating extraneous causes and decid 
ing between rival hypotheses owing to the dis 
position of tlie mind to form hypotheses and to 
prejudge cases it constantly happens that among 
all the possible suppositions which may occur two 
or three principal ones occupy us to the exclusion 
of the rest or it may be that if we have been less 
precipitate out of a great multitude rejected for 
obvious inapplicability to some one or other case 
two or three of better claims remain for decision 
and this such instances enable us to do one of 
the instances cited by bacon in illustration of his 
crucial class is vevy remarkable being neither more 
nor less than the proposal of a direct experiment to 
determine whether the tendency of heavy bodies 
downwards is a result of some peculiar mechanism 



ov natural philosophy 

in themselvesy or of the attraction of the earth by 
the corporeal mass thereof as by a collection of 
bodies of the same nature if it be so he says 
 it whl follow that the nearer all bodies approach 
to the earth the stronger and with the greater 
force and velocity they will tend tb it but the 
rther they are the weaker and slower and his 
experiment consists in comparing the effect of a 
spring and a weight in keeping up the motions of 
two clocks regulated together and removed al 
ternately to the tops of hi buildings and into the 
deepest mines by clocks he could not have meant 
pendulum clocks which were not then known the 
first made in england was in butyydocks 
so that the comparison though too coarse was not 
contrary to sound mechanical principles in short 
its principle was the comparison of the effect of a 
spring with that of a weight in producing certain 
motions in certain times on heights and in mines 
now this is the very same thing that has really been 
done ixk the recent experiments of professors airy 
and whew ell in dolcoath mine a pendulum a 
weight moved by gravity has been compared with 
a chronometer balance moved and regulated by a 
spriiig in his th aphorism bacon also speaks of 
gravity as an incorporeal power acting at a distance 
and requiring time for its transmission a consider 
ation which occurred at a later period to laplace 
in one of his most delicate investigations 

 a well chosen and strongly marked cru 
dud instance is snetime of the highest import 
ance when two theories which run parallel to each 
other as is sometimes the case in their explan

ation of great classes of phenomena at length 
come to be placed at issue upon a single fact a 
beautiful instance of this will be cited in the next 
section we may add to the examples above given 
of such instances that of the application of chemical 
tests which are almost universauy crucial experi 
ments 

 bacons travelling instances are uiose 

in which the nature or quality under investigation 
 travels or varies in degree and thus accord 
ing to afford an indication of a cause by 
a gradation of intensity in the effect one of his 
instances is very happy being that of paper 
which is white when dry but proves less so when 
wet and comes nearer to the state of transparency 
upon the exclusion of the air and admission of 
water in reading this and many other instances 
in the novum organum one would almost suppose 
had it been written that its author had taken 
uiem from newtons optics 

 the travelling instances as well as what 
bacon terms frontier instances are cases in whidi 
we are enabled to trace that general law whidi 
seems to pervade all nature — the law as it is 
termed of contmuity and which is expressed in the 
well known smitence natura non agit per sal 
turn the pursuit of this law into cases where its 
application is not at first sight obvious has proved 
a fertile source of physical discovery and led ns to 
the knowledge of an analogy and intimate connecs 
lion of phenomena between which at first we should 
never have expected to find any 

 for example the transparency of gold mf 



of katural philosophy 

which permits a bluishreen light to pass through 
it is a frontier instance between the transparency 
of pellucid bodies and the opacity of metals and it 
prevents a breach of the law of continuity between 
transparent and opake bodies by exhibiting a bo 
€£ the class generally rarded the most opake in 
nature as still possessed of some slight degree of 
transparency it thus proves that the quality of 
opacity is not a contrary or anioffomsi quality to 
that of transparency but only its ltreme lowest 
degree

of the higher degrees of inductive generaliza 
tion and of the formation and verification 
of theories 

 as particular inductions and laws of the first 
degreeof generality are obtained from the consider 
ation of individual facts so theories result from a 
consideration of these laws and of the proximate 
causes brought into view in the previous process 
regarded all together as constituting a new set of 
phenomena the creatures of reason rather than of 
sense and each representing under general lan 
guage innumerable particular facts in raising these 
higher inductions therefore more scope is given to 
the exercise of pure reason than in slowly groping 
out our first results the mind is more disencum 
bered of matter and moves as it were in its own 
element what is now before it it perceives more 
intimately and less through the medium of sense 
or at least not in the same manner as when actually 
at work on the immediate objects of sense but it 
must not be therefore supposed that in the formation 
of theories we are abandoned to the unrestrained 
laxercise of imagination or at liberty to lay down 
arbitrary principles or assume the existence of mere 
fanciful causes tlie liberty of speculation which 
we possess in the domains of theory is not like

fetters but rather like that of the freeman who has 
learned the lessons of selfrestraint in the school of 
just subordination the ultimate objects we pursue 
in the highest theories are the same as those of the 
lowest inductions and the means by which we can 
most securely attain them bear a dose analogy to 
those which we have found successm in such in 
ferior cases 

 tlie immediate object we propose to our 
selves in physical theories is the analysis of pheno 
mena and the knowledge of the hidden processes 
of nature in their production so far as they can be 
traced by us an important part of this knowledge 
consists in a discovery of the actual structure or 
mechanism of the universe and its parts through 
which and by which those processes are executed 
and of the agents which are concerned in their 
performance now the mechanism of nature is 
for the most part either on too large or too small j 
scale to be immediately cognizable by our senses 
and her agents in like manner elude direct observ 
ation and become known to us only by their effects 
it is in vain therefore that we desire to become 
witnesses to the processes carried on with such 
means and to be admitted into the secret recesses 
and laboratories where they are effected micro 
scopes have been constructed which magnify more 
than a thousand times in unear dimension so that 
the smallest visible grain of sand may be enlarged 
to the appearance of one a thousand molion times 
more bulky yet the only impression we receive by 
viewing it thrpugh such a magnifier is that it re

intimate structure on which depend its colour its 
hardness and its chemical properties remidns still 
concealed we do not seem to have made even an 
approach to a closer analysis of it by any such 
scrutiny 

 on the other hand the mechanism of the 
great system of which our planet forms a part 
escapes immediate observation by the immensity of 
its scale nay even by the slowness of its evolutions 
the motion of the minute hand of a watch can 
hardly be perceived without the closest attention 
and that of the hour hand not at all but what are 
these in respect of the impression of slowness they 
produce in our minds compared with a revolving 
movement which takes a whole year or twelve 
thirty or eighty years to complete as is the case 
with the planets in their revolutions round the smu 
yet no sooner do we come to reflect on the linear 
dimensions of these orbs which however we do 
not secy nor can we measure them but by a long 
cucuitous and difficult process than we are lost in 
astonishment at the swiftness of the very motiods 
which before seemed so slow the motion of the 
sails of a windmill offers on a small scale an luua 
trative case at a distance the rotation seems slour 
and steady — but when we stand dose to one of the

with which it rushes by us

 again the agents emplojed by nature to act 
on material stractures are in¥ile and only to be 
traced by the effects they produce heat dilates 
matter with an irresistible fnrce but what heat if 
remains yet a problem a current of electricity 
passing along a wire moves a magnetized needle at a 
distance but except from this effect we perceive no 
difference between the condition of the wire when it 
conveys and when it does not convey the stream 
and we apply the terms current or stream to the 
electricity only because in some of its relations 
it reminds us of something we have observed in a 
stream of air w water in like manner we see 
that the moon circulates about the earth and be 
cause we believe it to be a solid mass and have 
never seen one solid substance revolve round an 
other within our reach to handle and examine 
unless retained by a force or united by a tie we 
conclude that there is a force and a mode of con 
nection between the moon and the earth though 
what that mode can be we have no conception 
nor can imagine how such a force can be exerted 
at a distance and with empty space or at most an 
invisible fluid between see 

 yet are we not to despair since we 
see regular and beautiful results brought about in 
human works by means which nobody would at 
first sight think could have any thing to do with

after all the acting cause in this process is nothing 
more than a few gallons of water boiled in an iron 
vessel at a distance from the scene of operations 
but why the water so boiled should be capable of 
producing the active energy which sets the whole 
apparatus in motion is and will probably long 
remain a secret to us 

 this however does not at all prevent our 
having a very perfect comprehension of the whole 
subsequent process we might frequent printing 
houses and form a theory of printing and having 
worked oiu way up to the point where the mechanical 
action commenced the boiler of the steamengine 
and verified it by taking to pieces and putting toge 
ther again the train of wheels and the presses and by 
sound theoretical examination of all uie transfers of 
motion from one part to another we shouldat length 
pronounce our theory good and declare that we 
understood printing thoroughly nay we mit 
even go away and apply the principles of medianism 
we had learned in this enquiry to other widely 
different purposes construct other machines and 
put them in motion by the same moving power 
and all without arriving at any correct idea as to 
the ultimate source of the force employed but 
if we were inclined to theorize rther we might 
do so and it is easy to imagine how two theorists 
might form very different hypotheses as to the origin 
of the power which alternately raised and depressed 
the pistonrod of the engine one for example miit 
maintain that the boiler whose contents we will va 
pose that neither theorist has been permitted to 
examine was the den of some powerful unknown

analogies in the warmth the supply of fuel and 
water the breathing noises the smoke and above 
all the mechanical power exerted he would say 
not without a show of reason that where there is 
a positive and wonderful effect and many strong 
analogies sudi as materials consumed and all the 
usual signs of life maintained we are not to deny 
the existence of animal life because we know no 
animal that consumes such fixd nay he might 
observe with truth that the fuel actually consists 
p£ the chemi ingredients which constitute the 
chief food of all animals c while on the other 
hand his brother theorist who caught a glimpse 
of the fire and detected the peculiar sounds of 
ebullition might acquire a better notion of the 
case and form a theory more in consonance with 
£ict 

 now nothing is more common in phy 
sics than to find two or even many theories main 
tained as to the origin of a natural phenomenon 
for instance in the case of heat itself one con 
aiders it as a really existing material fluid of such 
exceeding subtlety as to penetrate all bodies and 
•even to be capable of combining with them che 
xnically while another regards it as nothing but 
a rapid vibratory or rotatory motion in the ulti 
mate particles of the bodies heated and produces 
a singularly ingenious train of mechanical reason 
ing to show that there is nothing contradictory to 
und djrnamical principles in such a doctrine

the theory of gravitation we suppose an agent — 
force or mechanical power — to act on ofmy material 
body which is placed in the presence of any others 
and to urge the two mutually towards each other 
this is a vera canua for heavy bodies that is 
all lodie but some more some less tend to or 
endeavour to readi the earth and require the 
exertion of force to counteract this endeavour or 
to keep them up now diat which opposes and 
neutralizes force is force and again a plumbine 
which when allowed to hang freely always hangs 
perpendicularly is found to hang observably aside 
from the perpendicular when in the neighbourhood 
of a considerable mountain thereby proving that a 
force is exerted upon it which draws it towards die 
mountain moreover since it is a ct that the 
moon does circulate about the eardi it must be 
drawn towards the earth by a force for if there 
were no force acting upon it it would go on in a 
straight line without turning aside to circulate in an 
orbit and would therefore soon go away and be lost 
in space this force then which we odl the font 
of gravity is a real cause 

 we have next to consider the laws which 
regulate the action of these our primary agents 
and these we can only arrive at in three ways ist by 
inductive reasoning that is by examining sjl the cases 
in which we know them to be exerctsed inferring 
as well as circumstances will permit its amount or 
intensity in each particular case and then pieciog 
together as it were these disfecta membra gcnenl 
izing from them and so arriving at the laws desired 
dly by forming at once a bold hypothesis per 



aw katural philosophy 

ucolarizmg the law and trriiig the truth of it by 
fbllowing out its consequences and comparing them 
with facts or sdly by a process partaking of 
both these and combining the advantages of both 
without their defects viz by assuming indeed the 
hnrs we would discover but so generally expressed i 
diat they shall include an unlimited variety of 
particular laws — following out the consequences 
of this assumption by the application of such general 
principles as the case admits — comparing them 
m succession with all the particular cases within our 
knowledge and lastly on this comparison so modi 
fying and restricting the general enunciation of our 
laws as to make the results agree 

 all these three processes for the discovery 
of those general elementary laws on which the 
higher theories are grounded are applicable with 
different advantage in different circumstances we 
might exemplify their successive application to 
the case of gravitation but as this would rather 
lead into a disquisition too particular for the ob 
jects of this discourse and carry us too much 
into the domain of technical mathematics we shall 
content ourselves with remarking that the method 
last mentioned is that which mathematicians espe 
cially such as have a considerable command of those 
general modes of representing and reasoning on 
quantity which constitute the higher analysis find 
tihe most universally applicable and the most effica 
cious and that it is applicable with especial ad 
vantage in cases where subordinate inductions of 
the kind described in the last section have already 
led to laws of a certain generality admitting of

mathematical expression such a case for instancey 
is the elliptic motion of a planet which is a general 
proposition including the statement of an infinite 
number of particular jiceff in which the laws of its 
motion allow it to be some time or other found and 
for which of course the law of force must be so 
assumed as to account 

 with regard to the first process of the 
three above enumerated it is in fact an induction 
of the kind described in § and all the re 
marks we there made on that kind of induction 
apply to it in this stage the direct assumption 
of a particular hrpothesis has been occasionallj 
practised very successfully as examples we may 
mention coulombs and poissons theories of elec 
tricity and magnetism in both which phenomena 
of a very complicated and interesting nature 
are referred to the actions of attractive and re 
pulsive forces following a law similar in its expres 
sion to the law of gravitation but the difficid 
and labour which in the greater theories always 
attends the pursuit of a fundamental law into tto 
remote consequences effectually precludes this me 
thod from being commonly resorted to as a meaae 
of discovery unless we have some good reaaoo 
from analogy or otherwise for believii that the 
attempt will prove successful or have been first 
led by partial inductions to particular laws whiob 
naturally point it out for trial

observed deviations in the motions of our system 
which stood out as exceptions or were 
noticed as residual phenomena and reserved for 
further enquiry j in that imperfect view of 
the subject which we got in the subordinate process 
by which we rose to our general conclusion prove 
to be the immediate consequences of the abovemen 
tioned mutual actions as such they are neither 
exceptions nor residual facts but fulfilments of 
general rules and essential features in the state 
ment of the case taithoui whicti our induction would 
be invalid and the law of gravitation positively un 
true 

 in the theory of gravitation the law is all 
in sdl applying itself at once to the materials and di 
rectly producing the result a but in many other 
cases we have to consider not merely the laws which 
regulate the actions of our ultimate causes but a 
system of medianism or a structure of parts through 
the intervention of which their effects become 
sensible to us thus in the delicate and curiotn 
electrodynamic theory of ampere the mutual 
attraction or repulsion of two magnets is referred 
to a more universal phenomenon the mutual action 
of electric currents according to a certain funda 
mental law but in order to bring the case of a 
magnet within die range of diis law he is obliged 
to make a supposition of a peculiar structure or 
mechanism which constitutes a body a magnet 
iz that around each particle of die body there 
shall be constantly circulating in a certain statea 
direction a small current of electric fluid

 thisy we may say u too complex it is 
artificial and camiot be granted yet if the ad 
mission of this or any other structure tenfold more 
artificial and complicated will enable any one to 
present in a general point of view a great number 
of particular cts — to make them a part of one 
system and enable us to reason from the known 
to the unknown and actually to predict facts brfore 
iriaiy — we would ask why should it not be granted 
when we examine those instances of natures work 
manship which we can take to pieces and under 
stand we find them in the highest degree artificial 
in our own sense of the word take for example 
the structure of an eye or of the skeleton of an 
animal — what complexity and what artifice i in

tical surfaces a circular aperture capable of en 
largement or contraction without loss of form in 
the other a firamework of the most curious car 
pentry in which occurs not a single straight line 
nor any known geometrical curve yet all evidently 
systematic and constructed by rules which defy our 
research or examine a crystauized mineral which 
we can in some measure dissect and thus obtain 
direct evidence of an internal structure neither 
artifice nor complication are here wanting and 
though it is easy to assert that these appearances 
are afler all produced by something which would 
be very simple if we did but know it it is plain 
that the same might be said of a steamengine ex 
ecuting the most complicated movements previous 
to any investigation of its nature or any knowledge 
of the source of its power

 in estimatingy hovreyer the value of a 
theorj we are not to look in the fint uutanctf 
to the question whether it establishes satisfiicto 
lily or not a particular process or mechanism for 
of this after all we can never obtain more than 
that indirect evidence which consists in its leading 
to the same results what in the actual state of 
science is fiir more important for us to knoiw is 
whether our theory truly represent all the facts and 
include tu the laws to which observation and induc 
tion lead a theory which did this would no doubt 
go a great way to establish any hypothesis of me 
chanism or structure idiich might form an essen 
tial part of it but this is tery r from being 
the case except in a few limited instances and 
till it is so to lay any great stress on hypotheses 
of the kind except in as much as they serve 
as a scaffold for the erection of general laws is 
to quite mistake the scaffid for the pile re 
garded in this ligt hypotheses have often an emi 
nent use and a ftksility in framing them if attended 
with an equal fiuility in laying them aside when 
they have served their turn is one of the most 
valuable qualities a philosopher can possess whiles 
on the other hand a bigoted adherence to them 
r indeed to peculiar views of any kind in ojmsi 
tion to the tenor of cts as they arise is the bene 
of all philosophy 

 there is no doubt however that the

or all of one still more genotd and at length blend 
altogether in the point of view from which we learn 
toregardthem an example will illustrate what we 
mean it is a general law that au hot bodies 
flirow out or ratue heat in all directions by 
which we mean not that heat is an actual sub 
stance darted out from hot bodies but only that 
the laws of the transmisdon of heat to distant objects 
are similar to those which would regulate the dis 
tribution of particles thrown forth in all directions 
and that other colder bodies placed in their neigh 
bourhood become hot ea if they received the heat 
so radiated again all solid bodies which become 
heated in one part condueij or difiuse the heat 
frcmi that part through their whde substance 
here we have two modes of communicating heat 
by radiation and by conduction and both these 
have their peculiar and to all appearance very dif 
ferent laws now let us bring a hot and a cold 
body of the same substance gradually nearer 
and nearer together as they approach the heat 
win be communicated from the hot to the cold 
one by the laws cf radiaiion and from the nearer 
to the farther part of the colder one as it gra 
dually grows warm by those of eonducdon let 
their distance be diminished till they just lightly 
toudi how does the hei now pass from one to 
the other doubtless by radiation for it may 
be proved that in such a contact there is yet 
im interval let them then be forced together 
and it will seem dear that it must now be by 
€xmduoium yet their ituerval must diminish grar

dually as the force by which they are pressed 
togedier increases till they actually cohere and 
form one the law of continoity then of whicb 
we have before spoken forbids us to sup 
pose that the intilnate nature of the process of 
communication is changed in this transition from 
light to violent contact and from that to actual 
union if so we might ask at what point does the 
change happen especially since it is also de 
monstrable that the partides of the most solid 
body are not really in contact therefore the 
laws of conduction and radiation have a mutual 
dependence and the former are only extreme cases 
of the latter if then we would rightly understand 
 what passes or what is the process of nature in 
the slow communication of heat through the sub 
stance of a solid we must ground our enquiries 
upon what takes place at a distance and dien urge 
the laws to which we have arrived up to their 
extreme case 

 when two theories run parallel to eadi 
other and each explains a great many facts in com 
mon with the other any experiment which affords a 
crucial instance to decide between them or by 
which one or odier must frjl is of great importance 
in thus verifying dieories since they are grounded 
on general laws we may appeal not merely to par 
ticular cases but to whole classes of ct and we 
therefore have a great range among the individuals 
of these for the selection of some particular effect 
which ought to take place oppositely in the event 
of one of the two suppositions at issue bemg rigit

by m fresnel as decisive in his mindy of the ques 
tion between the two great opinions on the nature 
of light which since the time of newton and 
hujghens have divided philosophers see 
when two very dean glasses are laid one on the 
other if they be not perfectly flat but one or both 
in an almost imperceptible degree convex or promi 
nent beautiful and vivid colours will be seen between 
them and if diese be viewed through a red glassy 
their appearance will be that of alternate dark and 
bright stripes these stripes are formed between the 
two surces in apparent contact as any one may 
satisfy himself by using instead of a flat plate of 
glass for the upper one a triangularshaped piece 
called a prism like a threecornered stick and 
looking through the inclined side of it next the 
eye by which arrangement the reflection of light 
from the upper surce is prevented from inter 
mixing with that from the surces in contact 
now the coloured stripes thus produced are ex 
plicable ml both theories and are fpealed to by 
both as strong confirmatory facts but there is a 
difference in one circumstance according as one or 
the other theory is employed to explain them in 
the case of the huyghenian doctrine the intervals 
between the bright stripes ought to appetr ahsohddy 
hack in the other half bright when so viewed 
through a prism this curious case of difference 
was tried as soon as the opposing consequences of 
the two theories were noted by m fresnel and the 
result is stated by him to be decisive in favour of 
that theory which makes light to consist in the 
vibrations of an elastic medium

 theories are best armed at bj the con 
sideration of general laws but most securely terified 
by comparing em with particular facts because 
this serves as a verification of the whole train of 
induction from the lowest term to the highest 
but then the comparison must be made with ftcts 
purposely selected so as to include every variety of 
case not omitting extreme ones and in sufficient 
number to afford every reasonable probability of 
detecting error a single numerical comcidence in 
a final conclusion however striking the coincidence 
or important the subject is not sidicient newtons 
theory of sound for example lead to a numerical 
expression for the actual velocity of sound differing 
but little firom that afiebrded by the correct theory 
afterwards explained by la grange and when cer 
tain considerations not contemplated by him are 
auowed for agreeing with fisut yet this coincidence 
is no verification of newtons view of the general 
subject of sound which is defective in an essential 
point as the great geometer last named has very 
satisfisutorily shown this example is sufficient to 
inspire caution in restii the verificatbn of dieories 
upon any thing but a very extensive comparison with 
a great mass of observed fkcts 

 but on the other hand when a theory 
will bear the test of such extensive comparison 
it matters little how it has been originally firamed 
however strange and at first sight inadmissible its 
postulates may appear or however singular it may 
seem that suc postulates should have been fixed 
upon — if they only lead us by legitimate reasonings 
to conclusions in exact accordance with numerous 



of natural philosophy 

obsermtions purposel j made under such a variety of 
circumstances as faiiiy to embrace the whole range 
of the phenomena which the theory is intended to 
account for we cannot refuse to admit them or 
if we still hesitate to raord them as demonstrated 
truths we cannot at least object to receive them 
as temporary substitutes £ot such truths untfl the 
latter all become known if they suffice to ex 
plam dl the phenomena known it becomes highly 
improbable diat they will not explain more and if 
ah their conclusions we have tried have proved 
carrecty it is probable that others yet untried will 
be found so too so that in rejecting them altogether 
we should reject all the discoveries to whidi they 
may lead 

 in all theories which profess to give a true 

account of the process of nature in the production 

of any class of phenomena by referring them to 

general laws or to the action of general causes 

trough a train of modifying circumstances before 

we can apply those laws or trace the action of those 

causes in any assigned case we require to know the 

circumstances we must have datawhereon to ground 

their application now these can be learned only 

from observation and it may be seem to be aiguing 

in a vicious circle to have recourse to observation 

for any part of those theoretical conclusions by 

wfiose comparison with fact the theory itself is to 

be tried the consideration of an example will 

enable us to ikinove ttds difficulty the most 

general law which lias yet been discovered in che 

hiistty is this that idl the elementarv substances in 

nature are susceptible of entering into combination

with each other only in fixed or defimte proporiums 
by weight and not arbitrarily so that when any 
two substances are put together with a view to 
unite them if their weights are not in some certain 
determinate proportion a complete combination will 
not take place but some part of one or the other 
ingredient will remain over and above and uncom 
bined suppose now we have found a substance 
having all the outward characters of a homi 
neous or unmixed body but which on analysis we 
discover to consist of sulphur and lead in the 
proportion of parts of the former to of the 
latter ingredient and we would know whether this 
is to be regarded as a verification of the law of 
definite proportions or an exception to it the 
question is reduced to this whether the proportion 
 to iso be or be not that fixed and definite pro 
portion or one of them if there be more than one 
proportion possible in which according to the law 
in question sulphur and lead can combine now 
this can never be decided by merely looking at the 
law in all its generality it is clear that when par 
ticularized by restricting its expression to sulphur 
and lead the law should state what are those par 
ticular fixed proportions in which these bodies can 
combine that is to say there must be certain data 
or numbers by which these are distinguished firom 
all other bodies in nature and which require to be 
known before we can apply the general law to the 
particular case to determine such data obsenr 
ation itiijt be consulted and if we were to have 
recourse to that of the combination of the two ul 
stances in question with each other no doubt thece 



of natural philpht 

would be ground for the logical objection of a vicious 
cbde but this is not done the determination of 
these numerical data is derived from experiments 
purposely made on a great variety of different 
combinations among which that under consider 
ation does not of necessity occur and all these 
being found independently of each other to agree in 
giving the same results they are therefore safely as 
sumed as part of die system thus the law of defi 
nite proportions when applied to the actual state of 
nature requires two separate statements the one 
announcing the general law of combination the 
other particularizing the numbers appropriate to 
the several elements of which natural bodies con 
sist or the data of nature among these data if 
arranged in a list there will be found opposite to the 
element sulphur the number and opposite to 
kad and since is to in the exact 
proportion of to it appears that the com 
bination in question affords a satisfactory verification 
of the law 

 the great importance of physical data 
of this description and the advantage of having 
them well determined will be obvious if we con 
sider that a list of them when taken in combin 
ation with the general law affords the means of 
determining at once the exact proportion of the 
ingredients of all natural compounds if we only 
know the place they hold in the system in 
chemistry the number of admitted elements is 
between fifty and sixty and new ones are added 
continually as the science advances now the mo 

 thomsons first principles of chemistry

ment the number corresphulittg to any new sidi 
stance added to the list is determined we hanre 
in fact ascertained all the proportions in whkh it 
can enter into combination with di iie othersy so 
that a careful experiment made with the olbject 
of determining this number is in fiu equivalent 
to as many difperent expenments as there are 
binary ternary or yet more complicated cambii 
ations capable of existing into which the new 
substance may enter as an ingredient 

 the importance of obtaming exact phj 
sical data can scarcely be too much insisted on ibr 
without them the most elaborate theories are littie 
better than mere inapplicable forms of words a 
would be of little consequence to be infimned 
abstractedoiy that ihe sun and ffdanets attract eack

assistance afforded by governments to the execution 
of continued series of observations adapted to this 
especial end should continue to be as it has hitherto 
almost exclusively been confined to astronomy 

 physical data intended to be employed 
as elements of calculation in extensive theories 
require to be known with a much greater degree 
of exactness than any single observation possesses 
not only on account of their dignity and import 
ance as affording the means of representing an 
indefinite multitude of facts but because in the 
variety of combinations that may arise or in the 
changes that circumstances may undergo cases 
will occur when any trifling error in one of the 
data may become enormously magnified in the final 
result to be compared with observation thus in 
the case of an eclipse of the sun when the moon 
enters very obliquely upon the suns disc a trifling 
error in the diameter of either the sun or moon 
may make a great one in the time when the edipse 
shsjl be announced to commence it ought to be 
remarked that these are of all others the con 
junctures where observations are most available for 
the determination of data for by the same rule 
that a small change in the data will in such cases 
produce a great one in the thing to be observed 
so vice versdf any moderate amount of error com 
mitted in an observation undertaken for ascertaining 
its value can produce but a very trifling one in the 
reverse calculation from which the data come to be 
determined by observation this remark extends 
to every description of physical data in every de 
partment of science and is never to be overlooked

when the object in view is the determination of 
data with the last degree of precision 

 but how it may be asked are we to 
ascertain by observation data more precise than 
observation itself how are we to conclude the 
value of that which we do not see with greater 
certainty than that of quantities which we actually 
see and measure it is the number of observe 
ations which may be brought to bear on the deter 
mination of data that enables us to do this what 
ever error we may commit in a single determination 
it is highly improbable that we should always err 
the same way so that when we come to take an 
average of a great number of determinations un 
less there be some constant cause which gives a 
bias one way or the other we cannot fail at 
length to obtain a very near approximation to the 
truth and even allowing • a bias to come much 
nearer to it than can fairly be expected from any 
single observation liable to be influenced by the 
same bias 

 thb useful and valuable property of the 
average of a great many observations that it brings 
us nearer to the truth than any single observation 
can be relied on as doing renders it the most con 
stant resource in all physical enquiries where accu 
racy is desired and it is surprising what a rapid 
effect in equalizing fluctuations and destroying 
deviations a moderate multiplication of individual 
observations has a better example can hardly 
be taken than the average height of the quicksilver 
in the common barometer which measures the 
pressure of the air and whose fluctuations are pro

take an average of the observed heights we shall

ibr many years in succession the annual averages

siderations respecting the probaue nceanej oi oui

pnjbme they lie in so doing we are obliged to 
have recourse to a refined and curious branch 
of mathematical enquiry called the doctrine of

babilily of any conclusion to calculation so as to 
be able to give more thaa a mere guess at the 
dee of reliance which ought to be puced in 
it 

 to give some general idea of the consi 
derations which such computations involve let us 
imagine a person firing with a pistol at a wafer on a 
wan ten yards distant we might in a general way 
take it fir granted that he would hit the wall but 
not the wafer at the first shot but if we would form 
any thing like a probable conjecture a£kno nsorhe 
lould come to it we must first have an idea of his 



 discourse on the study 

skill no better way of judging could be devised than 
by lettinghim fire a hundred shots at it and marking 
where they all struck suppose this done — suppose 
the wafer has been hit once or twice that a certain 
number of balls have hit the wall within an inch of 
it a certain number between one and two inches 
and so on and that one or two have been some feet 
wide of the mark still the question arises what 
estimate are we thence to form of his skill how 
near or nearer may we after this experience 
safely or at least not unfairly bet that he will come 
to the mark the next subsequent shot this the 
laws of probability enable us on such data to say 
again suppose e we were allowed to measure 
the distances the wafer were to have been taken 
away and we were called upon on the mere evi 
dence of the marks on the wall to say where it had 
been placed it is clear that no reasoning would en 
able any one to say with certainty yet there is as 
suredly one place which we may fix on with greater 
probability of being right than any other now 
this is a very similar case to that of an observer — 
an astronomer for example — who would determine 
the exact place of a heavenly body he points 
to it his telescope and obtains a series of results 
disagreeing among themselves but yet all agreeing 
within certain limits and only a comparatively small 
number of them deviating considerably from the 
mean of au and firom these he is called upon to 
say definitively what he shall consider to have 
been the most probable place of his star at the 
moment just so in the calculation of physical 
data where no two results agree exactly and 



op natural philosophy 

where all come within limits some wide some 
dose what have we to guide us when we would 
make up our minds what to conclude respecting 
them it is evident that any system of calcula 
tion that can be shown to lead of necessity to the 
most probable conclusion where certainty is not 
to be had must be valuable however as this doc 
trine is one of the most difficult and delicate among 
the applications of mathematics to natural philo 
sofy this slight mention of it must suffice at 
present 

 in the foregoing pages we have endea 
voured to explain the spirit of the methods to which 
since the revival of philosophy natural science has 
been indebted for the great and splendid advances 
it has made what we have all along most earnestly 
desired to impress on the student is that natural 
philosophy is essentially united in all its depart 
ments through all which one spirit reigns and one 
method of enquiry applies in cannot however be 
studied as a whole without subdivision into parts 
and in the remainder of this discourse we shall 
therefore take a summary view of the progress 
which has been made in the different branches into 
which it may be most advantageously so subdivided 
and endeavour to give a general idea of the nature 
of each and of its relations to the rest in the 
course of this we shall have frequent opportunity 
to point out the influence of those general principles 
we have above endeavoured to explain on the pro 
gress of discovery but this we shall only do as

amination of nature so far as it has been prosecuted 
to the discovery of natural agents and the mode in 
which they act 

 the first great agent which the analysis 
of natural phenomena offers to our consideration 
more frequently and prominently than any other is 
force its effects are either st to counteract the 
exertion of opposing force and thereby to maintain 
equilibrium or dly to produce motion in matter 

 matter or that whatever it be of which 
all the objects in nature which manifest themselves 
directly to our senses consist presents us with two 
general qualities which at first sight appear to stand 
in contradiction to each other — activity and inertness 
its activity is proved by its power of spontaneously 
setting other matter in motion and of itself obeying 
their mutual impulse and moving under the influence 
of its own and other force inertness in refusing to 
move unless obliged to do so by a force impressed 
externally or mutually exerted between itself and 
other matter and by persisting in its state of motion 
or rest unless disturbed by some external cause 
yet in reality this contradiction is only apparent 



 natural philosophy 

force being the cause and motion the effect pro 
duced by it on matter to say that matter is inert 
or has meriia as it is termed is only to say that 
the cause is expended in producing its effect and 
that the same cause cannot without renewal pro 
duce double or triple its own proper effect in this 
point of tiew equilibrium may be conceived as a 
continual production of two opposite effects each 
undoing at every instant what the other has done 

 however if this should appear too metaphy 
sical at all events this difference of effects gives rise 
to two great divisions of the science of force which 
are commonly known by the names of statics 
and dynamics the latter term which is general 
and has been used by us before in its generd sense 
being usually confined to the doctrine of motion as 
produced and modified by force each of these 
great divisions again branches out into distinct sub 
divisions according as we consider the equilibrium 
or motion of matter in the three distinct states in 
which it is presented to us in nature the solid 
liquid and aeriform state to which perhaps ought 
to be added the viscous as a state intermediate be 
tween that of solidity and fluidity the consideration 
of which though very obscure and difiicult offers a 
high degree of interest on a variety of accounts 

 the principles both of the statical and 
dynamical divisons of mechanics have been defini 
tively fixed by newton on a basis of sound induction 
and as they are perfectly general and apply to every 
case they are competent as we have already before 
observed to the solution of every problem that can 
occur in the deductive processes by which pheno 



 discoimse on the stuot 

mena are to be exfilained or effects calculated 
hence they andude every questkm that can arise 
respecting tiue motions and rest of the smallest ar 
tides of matter as welt as of tfaie largest masses 
but the mode of reasoning from these general prin 
ciples difficrs materially whether we consider ikem 
as applied to masses of matter of a sensible uze or 
to those exoessivdiy minute and peribtafw indivisible 
molecules of whidi sudi masses are composed 
the investigations whidi relate to the latter subject 
are extremely intricate as they necessarily involve 
the consideration of the hjrpotheses we may form 
jnespecting the intimate constitution of the sevend 
sorts of bodies above enumerated 

 on the other hand those which respect the 
equilibrium and motions of sensible masses of matter 
e happily capable of being so managed as to render 
mmeceisaiy the adoption of any particular hypothesis 
of structure thus in reasoning respecting the sp 
plication offerees to a solid mass we suppose its parts 
indissolubly and unalterably connected it matters 
not by what tie provided this condition be satisfied 
that one pnt of it cannot be moved without setting 
idl the rest in motion so that the relative situation 
of the parts one among another be not diaoged 
this is the abstract notion of a solid which the me 
chanician employs in his reasonings and their con 
dusions will apply to natural bodies of course only 
so r as tiiey conform to such a definition in atrict 
ness of speaking however there are no bodies whic 
absolutdy conform to it no substance is knovm 
whose parts are absolutdy incapable of jriddii ovie 
among another but the amount by which they do 



of natural philosophy 

yield is so excessively small as to be demonstrably 
incapable in most cases of having any influence 
on the results and in those where it has such in 
fluence an especial investigation of its amount can 
always be made this gives rise to two subdivisions 
of the application of mechanical reasonings to solid 
masses those which refer to the action of forces 
on flexible or elastic and on inflexible or rigid 
bodies comprehending under the latter all such 
whose resistance to flexure or fracture is so ver 
great as to permit our adoption of the language and 
ideas of the extreme case without fear of material 
error 

 in like manner when we reason respecting 
the action of forces on a fluid mass all we have 
occasion to assume is that its parts are freely move 
able one among the other if besides this we 
choose to regard a fluid as incompressible and 
deduce conclusions on this supposition they will 
hold good only so far as there may be found such 
fluids in nature now in strictness there are none 
such but practically speaking in the greater number 
of cases their resistance to compression is so very 
great that the result of the reasoning so carried on 
is not sensibly vitiated and in the remaining cases 
the same general principles enable us to enter on a 
special enquiry directed to this point and hence the 
division of fluids in mechanical language into comi 
presible and incompressible the latter being only 
the extreme or limiting case of the former 

 as we propose here however only to 
consider what is the actual constitution of nature 
we shall regard all bodies as tliey really e more

or less flexible and yielding we know for certaihy 
that the space which any material iboc appears to 
occupy is not entirely filled by it because there is 
none which by the application of a sufficient force 
may not be eompreised or forced into a smaller space 
and which either wholly as in air or liquids or in 
part as in the greater number of solids will not re 
cover its former dimensions when the force is taken 
off in the case of air this condensation may be 
urged to almost any extent and not only does tl 
mass of air o condensed completely recover its on 
ginal bulk when the applied pressure is removed 
but if that ordinary pressure under which it exists 
at the earths surface and which arises from the 
weight of the atmospherele also removed by an air 
pump it will still further dilate itself witihout linnt 
 far as we have yet been able to try it hence 
we are led to the conclusion that the particles of ur 
are mutually elastic and have a ienidawy to receeb 
from one anoetf which can only be counteracted by 
faroe and therefore is itself a fbrce of the repulsive 
kind nevertheless as air is heavy and as gravi 
tation is a universal property of matter there iso 
doubt that this repulsive tendency must hare a 
limit and that there is a distance to which if the 
particles of the air could lie removed from eadi 
other their mutual repulsion woi cease and an 
attractifm take its place this limit is probably 
attained at some very great heiglht dxnre the earas 
burface beyond whidh of tottrse its atmosphere 
cannot extend 

i what however we can only condade by 
this or similar reasoning respecting air we see dka 



of natural philosophy 

tidctly in liquids they are all though m a small de 
gree compressible and recover their former dimen 
sidns conletely when e pressure is removed but 
they cannot be dilated by mechanical means and 
liave no tendency while they remain hquids to en 
brge themselves beyond a certain limit and there 
fore they assume a determinate surface while at 
reist and their parts actufdly resbt further separ 
ation with a considerable force thus giving rise to 
the phenomenon of the cokesion €f liquids 

 both in air and in liquids however the 
most ierfect freedom of motion of the parts among 
each other subsists which could hardly be the case 
if they were not separate and independent of each 
other and from this combined with the foregoing 
considerations it has been concluded that they do 
not actually touch but are kept asunder at deter 
mmate distances from each othor by the constant 
action of the two forces of attraction and repulsion 
which are supposed to balance and counteract eadi 
other at thcordinary distances of the particles but 
to prevail the one or the oer according as they 
are forcibly tnged together or pulled asunder 

i in solids however e case is verydifferent 
the mutual free motion of their parts inter se is 
powerfully impeded and in some almost destroyed 
in some a slow and gradual change ofgure may be 
odnced t a great extent ij pressure or blows 
as for mstance in the metals day imtter c in 
others fhuhure is the consequence of any attempt 
to change the figure by violence beyond a certain 
very small hmit in souds then it is evident that 
ibe coniiideration of their intimate structure has a

 discourse on the study 

very great influence m modifying the general results 
of the action of such attractive and repulsive forces 
as may be assumed to account for the phenomena 
they present yet the general facts that their parts 
cohere with a certain energy and that they resist dis 
placement or intrusion on the part of other bodies 
are sufficient to demonstrate at least the existence 
of such forces whatever obscurity may subsist as to 
their mode of action 

 this division of bodies into airs liquids 
and solids gives rise then to three distinct branches 
of lechanical science in each of which the general 
principles of equilibrium and motion have their pe 
culiar mode of application viz pneumatics hydro 
statics and what might without impropriety be 
termed stereostatics 

pneumatics 

 pneumatics relates to the equilibrium or 
movements of aerial fluids uader all circumstances 
of pressure density and elasticity the weight of 
the air and its pressure on all the bodies on the 
earths surface were quite unknown to the ancients 
and only flrst perceived by galileo on the occasion 
of a suckingpump refusing to draw water above a 
certain height before his time it had always been 
supposed that water rose by suction in a pipe in 
consequence of a certain natural abhorrence of a 
vacuum or empty space which obliged the water to 
enter by way of supplying the place of the air sucked 
out but if any such abhorrence existed and had 
the force of an acting causey which could urge water 
a single foot into a pipe there is no reason wbj tbe 



of natural philosophy 

same principle should not cany it up two three or 
any number of feet none why it should suddenly 
stop short at a certain height and refuse to rise 
higher however violent the suction might be nay 
even fall back if purposely forced up too high 

 galileo however at first contented himself 
with the conclusion that the nattval abhorrence of 
a vacuum was not strong enough to sustain the 
water more than about thirtytwo feet above its 
level and although the true cause of the pheno 
menon at length occurred to him in the pressure of 
the air on the general surface it was not satisfactorily 
demonstrated till his pupil torricelli conceived the 
happy idea of instituting an experiment on a small 
scale by the use of a much heavier liquid mercury 
instead of water and in place of sucking out the 
air from above employing the much more efiectual 
method of filling a long glass tube with mercury 
and inverting it into a basin of the same metal it 
was then at once seen as by a glaring instance that 
the maintenance of the mercury in the tube which 
is nothmg else than the common barometer was the 
effect of a perfectly definite external cause while its 
fluctuations firom day to day with tlie varying state 
of the atmosphere strongly corroborated the notion 
of its being due to the pressure of the external air 
on the surfece of the mercury in the reservoir 

 the discovery of torricelli was however 
at first much misconceived and even disputed till 
the question was finally decided by appeal to a cru 
cial instance one of the first if not the very first 
on record in physics and for which wq are indebted 
to the celebrated pascal his acuteness pjrcived 

a 



sso iiscoursb xn the stvdy 

that if the weight of the inoumbt air be the direct 
cau of the elevation of the mercury it must be 
measnredby the amount of that elevation andthere 
fqte thatby carrdng a barometer up a highmouitaiii 
and go ascending into the atmosphere above a laige 
portion of the incuoibent air the pressure as well 
as the length of the column sustaiiiedby it mut b 
diminished while on the other hand if the pheno 
menon were due to the cause originally asmgned no 
difference could be expected to take plao whether 
the observation were made on a mountam or on the 
n perhaps the decisive effect of the experiment 
which he caused to be instituted for the purpose on 
the puy de dome a high mountain in auveigne 
while it convinced every one of the truth of torri 
cellis views tended more powerfully than any thing 
which had previously been done in science to con 
firm in the minds of men that diosition to expe 
rimental verification which had scarcely yet udcen 
full and secure root 

 inmiediately on this discovery followed 
that of the airpump by ottpvonguricke of mag 
deburgh whose aim seems to have been to decide 
the question whether a vacuum could or could not 
exist by endeavouring to make one the imper 
fiction of his mechanism enabled him only to dimi 
nish the aerial contents of bis receivers not entirety 
ta empty them but the curious effects produced by 
even a partial exhaustion of air eedily exxited a 
tantion and induced our illustrious countiymaiiy 
robert boyle to the prosecution of those expeii 
iqenta which terminated in his hands and in those 
of hauksbee hooke mariotte and other in ai

wjiich chemistry has shown to exist and to main

a portion of its weight equal to that of the liquid it 
displaces it seems very astonishing after this that 
it should not have been at once concluded that the 
weight thus said to be lo is only counteracted bj 
the upward pressure of the liquid and that there 
fore a portion of any liquid surrounded on all sides 
by a liquid of the same kind does really exert its 
weight in keeping its place yet the prejudice that 
 liquids do not gravitate in their natural place 
kept its ground and was only dispelled with the 
mass of error and absurdity which the introduction 
of a rational and experimental philosophy by gralileo 
swept away 

 the hydrostatical law of the equal pres 
sure of liquids in au directions with its train of 
curious and important consequences is an imme 
diate conclusion from the perfect mobility of their 
parts among one another in consequence of which 
each of them tends to recede from an excess of 
pressure on one side and thus bears upop the rest 
and distributes the pressure among its neighbours 
in this form it was laid down by newton and has 
proved one of the most useful and fertile principles 
of physicomathematical reasoning on the equi 
librium of fluid masses as affording a means of 
tracing the action of a force applied at any point 
of a liquid through its whole extent it applies 
too without any modification to expansible fluids 
as well as to liquids and in the applications of 
geometry to this subject enables us to dispense 
with any minute and intricate enquiries as to the 
mode in which individual particles act on each other 

 in a practical point of view this law is 



of natural philosophy 

remarkable for the directness of its application to 
useful purposes the inunediate and perfect distribu 
tion of a pressure applied on any one part however 
small of a fluid sivce through the whole mass en 
ables us to communicate at one inaumt the same pres 
sure to any number of such parts by merely increasing 
the surface of the fluid which may be done by 
enlarging the containing vessel and if the vessel 
be so constructed that a large portion of its surface 
idiall be moveable together the pressures on all the 
similar parts of this portion will be united into one 
ocmsentient force which may thus be increased to 
any extent we please the hydraulic press in 
vented by bramah or rather applied by him afer 
a much more ancient inventor stevin is con 
structed on this principle a small quantity of 
water is driven by sufficient pressure into a vessel 
akready fuuy and provided with a moveable sure 
or piston of great size under such circumstances 
something must give way the great surface of the 
piston accumulates the pressure on it to such an 
extent that nothing can resist its vidence thus 
trees are torn up by the roots piles extracted from 
the earth woollen and cotton goods compressed 
into the most portable dimensions and even hay 
for military service reduced to such a state of 
coercion as to be easily packed on board transports 
 liquids differ from aeriform fluids by 
their eohesionj which may be regarded as a kind 
of afroach to a solid state and was so regarded 
by bacon indeed there can be little doubt 
that the solid liquid and aeriform states of bodies 
are merely stages in a progress of gradual tran

sition from one extreme to the other and tbat 
however strongly marked the distinctions between 
them may jgearthey ivoll ultimately turn out ta 
he separated by no sudden or violent line of de 
maicatiqn but shade into each other by insensle 
gradations the lata experiments of baron cagpard 
de latour may be regarded as a flrstt step towards 
the full demonstration pf this but the 
cohesion of liquids is not lilce that of solid so 
mpdifid by their structiore in other respects as ta 
destroy the mobility of their parts one among an 
other unless in those cases of nearer approach to 
the solid state whi obtain in viscid or gummy 
liquids on the contrary the tiwo qualities coexist 
and give risq to a numbenofl curious and intricate 

 one of the most remarjiable of these is 
axillary attraction or capillarity as it is sometimea 
called every body has remarked the adhesion o£ 
water to guisa the elevation of die general surface 
of the liquid where it is in contact with the con 
taining vessel the form ofa drop suspended at the 
under side of a solid these are instances of capil 
lary attraotaon if a small glass tube with a bore 
as fine as a hair be immersed in water the water 
wall be observed to rise in it to a certain height 
and to assume a concave surface at its upper ex 
trmity the attraction of the glass on the water 
and the cohesion of the parts of the water to eadt 
other are no doubt the joint causes of thia curious 
effict but the mode of action is at once obscure 
and comfdex and although the researches of li 
dm and young have thrown great light on it fur 



of naturai philosophy s 

ther inirestigatioq seemft necessaiy before we can 
be said distinctlj to understand it 

v as the capillarity and cohesion of the parts 
of liquids shows them to possess the powr of 
iutual attraction so their elasticity demonstrates 
thtit they also possess that of repulsion when for 
cibly brought nearer than their natural state from 
the extremely sipall extent to which the compres 
sion of liquids can be carried by any force we can 
employ compared with that of aii we must con 
clie that this repulsion is much mora violent in 
the former than in the latter but counteracted also 
by a ipore powerful force of attraction so much 
more powerful indeed is the resistance of liquids 
to compression that they were usually regarded as 
incompressible an opinion corroborated by a cele 
brated experiment made at florence in which 
water was forced through the pores as it was said 
of agolden ball more reqent experiments by cantoni 
and since by ferkins oersted and others have 
demonstrated howevjer the contrary and assigned 
the amount of compression 

 the consideration of the motions of fluids 
whether liquid or expansible is infinitely more com 
lucated than that of their equilibrium when their 
notions are slow it is reasonable to suppose tliat 
the law of the equable distribution of pressure ob 
tains but in veiy rapid displacements of their 
parts one among the other it is not easy tp see how 
such an equable distribution can be accomplished 
and some phenomena exist which seem to indicate 
 contrary conclusion 

 independent of this there are difficulties 



s discourse ok the study 

of an almost insuperable nature to the regular de 
ductive application of the general principles of 
mechanics to this subject which arise from the 
excessive intricacy of the pure mathematical en 
quiries to which its investigation leads it was 
newton who set the example of a first attempt to 
draw any conclusions respecting the motion of fluid 
masses by direct reasoning from dynamical prin 
ciples and thus laid the foundation of hydro 
dynamics but it was not till the time of dalem 
bert that the method of reducing any question 
respecting the motions of fluids under the action 
of forces to strict mathematical investigation could 
be said to be completely understood but the cases 
even now in which this mode of treating such ques 
tions can be applied with full satisfaction are few 
in comparison of those in which the experimental 
method of enquiry as already observed is 
preferable such for example is that of the re 
sistance of fluids to bodies moving through them 
a knowledge of which is of great importance in 
naval architecture and in gunnery where the re 
sistance of the air acts to an enormous extent 
such too among the practical subjects which de 
pend mainly on this branch of science are the use 
of sails in navigation the construction of windmifls 
and waterwheels the transmission of water throtigli 
pipes and channels the construction of docks and 
harbours c 

najbare cf solids in general 

 the intimate constitution of solids is in skll 
probability very complicated and we cannot be 



of natural philosophy 

to know much of it by some recent delicate ex 
periments on the dimensions of wires violently 
strained it has been shown that they are to a 
certain small extent capable of being dilated by 
tension as they are also of being compressed by 
pressure but within limits even narrower than those 
of liquids usually when strained too far they 
break and refuse to reunite or if compressed too 
forcibly take a permanent contraction of dimension 
thus wood may be indented by a blow and metals 
rendered denser and heavier by hammering or 
rohing there is a certain degree of confusion 
prevalent in ordinary language about the hardness 
elasticity and other similar qualities of solids weich 
it may be well to remove hardness is that dis 
position of a solid which renders it difficult to 
displace its parts among themselves thus steel 
 harder than iron and diamond almost infinitely 
harder than any other substance in nature but die 
compressibility of steel or the extent to which it 
will yield to a given pressure and recover itself is 
not much less than that of sofl iron and that of 
ice is very nearly the same with that of water 

 again we call indian rubber a very elastic 
body and so it is but in a different sense from 
steel its parts admit of great mutual displace 
ment without permanent dislocation however dis 
torted it recovers its figure readily but with a 
small £oirce yet if indian rubber were to be en 
dosed in a space that it just filled so as not to 
permit its parts to yield laterally doubtless it would 
resist actual compression with great violence here

imparted to him by his pupil gahn made a yet 
greater step and showed how at least one ispecies 



 discourse on the study 

of crystal might be built up of thin lamins ranged 
in a certain order and following certain rules of 
superposition he failed however in deducing just 
and general conclusions from this remark which 
correctly viewed is the foundation of the most im 
portant law of crystallography that which connects 
the primitive form with other forms capable of being 
exhibited by the same substance by a certain 
fixed relation an idea may be formed of what is 
meant by this sort of connection of one form with 
another by considering a pointed pyramid built 
up of cubic stones disposed in layers each of 
which separately is a square plate of the thickness 
of a single stone these layers laid horizontally 
one on the other and decreasing regularly in size 
from the bottom to the top produce a pyramidal 
form with a rough or channeled surface and if the 
layers are so extremely thin that the channels cease 
to be visible to the eye the pyramid will seem 
smooth and perfect 

 very shortly after this and without 
knowledge of what had been done by gahn and 
bergmann the abb hauy instructed by the ac 
cidental fracture of a fine groupe of crystals made 
the remark noticed already in and reasoning 
on it with more caution and success and pucw 
suing it into all its detail developed the general 
laws which regulate the superposition of the layers 
of particles of which he supposes all crystals to 
be built up and which enable us from knowing 
their primitive forms to discover previous to trial 
what other forms they are capable of assuming 
and which according to this idea are called deriv

ative or secondary forms mohs and others have 
since imagined processes and systems by which the 
derivation of forms from each other is facilitated 
and have corrected some errors of overhasty gener 
alization into which their predecessors had fallen

various substances which occur in nature and art 
actually do assume 

 in what manner a variety in point of ex 
temal form may originate in a variety qf figures 
in the ultimate particles of which a solid is com

what would happen if the bricks of which an edifice 
is constructed had all a certain leaning or bias in 
one direction out of the perpendicular suppose 
every brick for instance when laid flat on its fiice 
with its longer edges north and south had its eastern 
and western ces upright but its northern and 
southern ones leaning southwards at a certain in 
dination the same for each brick a house built 
of such bricks would lean the same way if the 
bricks fitted well together if besides this the 
eastern and western faces of the bricks instead of 
being truly upright had an inclination eastward the 
house would have a similar one and all its four 
comers instead of being upright would lean to the 
southeast suppose instead of a house a pyramid 
were built of such oblique bricks with the sides of 
its base directed to the four points of the compass

 whatever conception we naay form of the 
manner in which the particles of a crystal cohese 
and form masses it is next to impossible to divest 
ourselves of the idea of a determinate figure eom 
mon to them all any other susition indeed 
would be incompatible with that exact similarity in 
all other ivespects which the phenomena of chemistry 
may be considered as having demonstrated how 
ever it must be borne m mind that this idea plau 
sible as it may appear is yet in some degree hypo 
thetical and that the laws of crystallogrfihy as 
determined from inductive observation are quite 
independent of any supposition of the kind or even 
of the existence of such things as ultimate particles 
or atoms at all 

 still that peculiar internal constitution of 
solid bodies whatever it be which is indicated by 
the assumption of determinate figures by their 
splitting easier in some directions than in otheiby 
and by their presenting glittering plime surfiues 
when broken into fragments cannot but have an 
important influence on all their relatious to external 
agents as well as to their internal movementa and 
the mutual actions of their parts on one another 
accordingly the division of bodies into crystallized 
and uncrystallized or imperfectly crystallized is 
 one of the most universal importance and ahnoat 
all the phenomena produced by those more intimate 
natural causes which act within small limits and as

taken by the rays of light in traversing them aa 
weh as the properties impressed upon them in so 
doing are indmately connected with this structure 
the recent experiments of m savart too have 
proved that this is also the case with their power 
of resistance to external force on which depends 
their elasticity crystallized substances according 
to the results of these experiments resist compres 
sion with different degrees of elastic force according 
to the direction in which it is attempted to compress 
thfin and all the phenomena dependent on their 
dbisticity are affected by this cause especially those 
which relate to their vibratory movements and their 
conveyance of sound 

 there can be little doubt that modifica 
tions similarly depending on the internal structure 
of crystals will be traced through every depart

when hot than when cold and being confined by 
the glass ball which also expands but not muck 
m prcpariian it is forced to rise in the tube these 
and similar facts had long been known and accu 
rate measures of the total amount of dilatation of 
a variet j of different bodies under similar accessions 
of heat had been obtained and registered in tables 
but no one had suspected the important fact that 
this expansion in crystallized bodies takes place 
under totally different circumstances from what 
obtains in uncrystallized ones m mitscherlich has 
lately shown that such substances expand differently 
in different directions and has even produced a 
case in which expansion in one direction is actually 
accompanied with contraction in another this 
step the most important beyond a doubt whidi 
has yet been made in pjrrometry can however only 
be regarded as the first in a series of researches 
which will occupy the next generation and which 
promises to afford an abundant harvest of new 
facts as well as the elucidation of some of the 
most obscure and interesting points in the doctrine 
of heat 

 from what has been said it is clear that if 
we look upon solid bodies as collections o£ particles 
or atoms held together and kept in their places by 
the perpetual action of attractive and repulsive 
forces we cannot suppose these forces at least in 
crystallized substances to act alike in all directions 
hence arises the conception afpolarityj of which we 
see an instance on a great scale in the magnetic 
needle but which under modified forms there b 
nothing to prevent us from conceiving to act among

the ultimate atoms of solid or even fluid bodies 
and to produce all the phenomena which they 
exhibit in their crystallized state either when acting 
on each other or on light heat c it is not di£b 
cult if we give the reins to imagination to conceive 
how attractive and repulsive atoms bound together 
by some unknown tie may form little machines or 
compound particles which shall have many of the 
properties which we refer to polarity and accord 
ingly many ingenious suppositions have been made 
to that effect but in the actual state of science it 
is certainly safest to wave these hypotheses without 
lowever absolutely rejecting them and regard the 
polarity of matter as one of the ultimate phenomena 
to which the analysis of nature leads us and of 
which it is our business fully to investigate the laws 
before we endeavour to ascertain its causes or trace 
the mechanism by which it is produced 

 the mutual attractions and repulsions of the 
particles of matter then and their polarity idiether 
regarded as an original or a derivative property are 
the forces which acting with great energy and 
within very confined limits we must look to as the 
principles on which the intimate constitution of all 
bodies and many of their mutual actions depend 
these are what are understood by the general term 
o£ molecular farces molecular attraction has been 
attempted to be confounded by some with the 
general attraction of gravity which all matter exerts 
on all other matter but this idea is refuted by the 
plainest cts

 whenever an impulse of any kind is con 
veyed by the air to our ears it produces the im 
pression of sound but when such an impulse is 
regularly and uniformly repeated in extremdy rapid 
succession it gives us that of a musical note the 
pitch of the note depending on the rapidity of the 
succession see art the sense of harmony 
too depends on the periodical recurrence of coinci 
dent impulses on the ear and affords perhaps the 
only instance of a sensation for whose pleasing im 
pression a distinct and intelligible reason can be 
assigned 

 acoustics then or the science of sound 
is a very considerable branch of physics and me 
which has been cultivated from the earliest ages 
even pythagoras and aristotle were not ignorant of 
the general mode of its transmission through the 
air and of the nature of harmony but as a branch 
of science independent of its ddightful implication

physics which promise at once so much amusing in

the medium of strong analogies on that of light

 the nature of light has always been involved 
in considerable doubt and mystery the andients 
could scarcely be said to have any opinion on the 
subject unless indeed it could be considered such 
to affirm that distant bodies could not be put into 
communication without an intermedium and that 
therefore there must be something between the eye 
and the thing seen what that something is how 
ever they could only fqjrm crude and vague con 
jectures one supposed that the eyes themselves 
emit rays or emanations of some unknown kind by 
which distant objects are as it were felt a singularly 
imfortunate idea since it gives no reason why 
objects should not be equally well seen in the dark — 
no account in short of the part performed by ught 
ill vision others imagined that au visible objects are 
constantly throwing out from them in all directions 
fiome sort of resemblances or spectral forms of 
themselves which when received by the eyes

the properties of light remained cfined to these 
there would have been no occasion to have resorted 
to any other mode of conceiring it

who supposed lt to be produced in th same

colours in the ordinary refraction of light by a prism 
of which the theory of newton gives a complete 
and elegant explanation and the discovery of 
which by him marks one of the greatest epochs in 
the annals of experimental science this which has 
been often urged in objection to it renuuns still 
if not quite unanswered at least only imperfectly 
removed 

 other phenomena however were not 
wantmg to afford a further trial of the estplanatory 
jfoiders of either hrpothesis the di£fraction or 
inflection of light discovered by grimaldi a jesuit 
of bologna seemed to indicate that the rays of 
light were turned aside from their straight course 
by merely passing near bodies of every descrip 
tion these phenomena which are very curious 
and beautiful were minutely examined by newton 
and referred by him to the action of repulsive forces 
extending to a sensible distance from the surfaces 
of bodies and his explanation so r as the facts 
known to him are concerned appears as satisfactoiy 
as could reasonably be then expected and much 
more so than anything which could at that time be 
produced on the side of the hypothesis of huy 
ghens which in fact seemed incapable of giving 
any account whatever of them 

 another class of delicate and splendid 
optical phenomena which had begun to attract at 
tention somewhat previous to newtons time seemed 
fo leave both hypotheses equally at a loss these 
were the colours exhibited by very thin filni 
either of a liquid such as a soapbubble or of air 
as when two glasses are laid together with only air 



of natural philosophy 

between them these colours were examined by 
newton with a minuteness and care altogether un 
exampled in experimental philosophy at that time 
and with which few researches undertaken since 
willbear to stand in competition their result was 
a theory of a very singular nature which he 
grounded on an hjrpothesis of what he termed fiu 
tf easy tnnumission and reflection and which sup 
posed each ray of light to pass in its progress 
periodically through a succession of states such as 
would alternately dispose it to penetrate or be 
reflected back from the surface of a body on which 
it might isill the simplest way in which the reader 
may conceive this hjrpothesis is to regard every 
particle of light as a sort of little magnet revolving 
rapidly about its own centre while it advances in its 
course and thus alternately presenting its attractive 
and repulsive pole so that when it arrives at the 
surce of a body with its repulsive pole foremost 
it is repelled and reflected and when the contrary 
attracted so as to enter the surce newtoi 
however very cautiously avoided announcing his 
theory in this or any similar form confining himselit 
entirely to general language in consequence it 
has been confidently asserted by all his followers 
that the doctrine of fits of easy reflection and trans 
mission as laid down by him is substantially nothing 
more than a statement of facts were it so it is 
dear that any other theory which should offer a 
just account of the same phenomena must ultimately 
involve and coincide with that of newton but 
this as we shall presently see is not the case and 
this instance ought to serve to make us extremely

cautious how we evooy iu stating physical lavs 
derived from experizueut language whiph involyai 
any thing iu the slightest degree theoretical if we 
would present the laws themselves in a form which 
no future research shall modify or subvert 

 a third class of optical phenomena whidi 
were likewise discovered while newton was yet 
engaged in his ctical researches was that exhibited 
by doubly refracting crystals in what the pheno 
menon of double refraction consists we have idready 
had occasion to explain the fact itself was first 
noticed by erasmus bartolin in the crystal caued 
iceland spar and was studied with attention by 
huyghens who ascertained its laws and referred it 
with remarkable ingenuity and success to his theory 
of light by the additional hypothesis of such a con 
titutixi of his ethereal medium within the crystal 
as should enable it to convey an impulse ster in 
one direction than another as if for examples 
sake we should suppose a sound conveyed throih 
the air with different degrees of rapidity in a ver 
tical and horizontal direction 

 some remarkable ct accompanying the 
rouble refraction produced by iceland spar which 
bartolin huyghens and newton had observed led 
the latter to conceive the singular idea that a ray of 
lit after its emergence from such a oystal accjuires 
sidest that is to say distinct relations to surrounding 
space which it carries with it through its whole 
subsequent course and which give rise to all thoae

 discourse ok the study 

dr wouaston who reexamined and verified the 
laws of double refraction in iceland spar announced 
by huyghens attention being thus drawn to the 
subject the geometry of laplace soon found a means 
of explaining at least one portion of the mystery 
of this singular phenomenon by the newtonian 
theory of light applied under certain supposed con 
ditions and the reasoning which led him to the re 
sult at that time quite unexpected may justly be 
regarded as one of his happiest efforts the pro 
secution of the subject which had now acquired a 
high degree of interest was encouraged by the offer 
of a prize on the part of the french academy of 
sciences and it was in a memoir which received this 
honourable reward on that occasion in that 
malus a retired officer of engineers in the frendi 
army announced the great discovery of itie polarizer 
turn of light by ordinary reflection at the surce of 
a transparent body 

 malus found that when a beam of light is 
reflected from the surface of such a body at a certain 
angle it acquires precisely the same singular pro 
perty which is impressed upon it in the act of double 
refraction and which newton had before expressed 
by saying that it possessed sides this was the first 
circumstance which pointed out a connection be 
tween that hitherto mysterious phenomenon and 
any of the ordinary modifications of light and it 
proved ultimately the means of bringing the whole 
within the limits if not of a complete explanatioa 
at least of a highly plausible theoretical represent 
ation so true is in science the remark of bacon 



 



 natural philosophy 

that no natural phenomenon can be adequately 
studied in itself ahney but to be understood must 
be considered as it stands connected with allnature 

 the new class of phenomena thus disclosed 
were immediately studied with diligence and suc 
cess both abroad by mains and arago and at 
home by our countryman dr brewster and their 
laws investigated with a care proportioned to their 
importance when another and apparently still more 
extraordinary class of phenomena presented itself 
in the production of the most vivid and beautiful 
colours every way resembling those observed by 
newton in thin films of air or liquids only infinitely 
more developed and striking in certain transparent 
crystauized substances when divided into flat plates 
in particular directions and exposed in a beam of 
polarized light the attentive examination of these 
colours by wouaston biot and arago but more 
especially by brewster speedily led to the disclosure 
of a series of optical phenomena so various so 
brilliant and evidently so closely connected with the 
most important points relating to the intimate struc 
ture of crystallized bodies as to excite the highest 
interest — that sort of interest which is raised when 
we feel we are on the eve of some extraordinary 
discovery and expect every moment that some lead 
ing fact will turn up which will throw light on all 
that appears obscure and reduce into order all that 
seems anomalous 

 this expectation was not disappointed 
so long tefore the time we are speaking of as the 
first year of the present century our illustrious

wi discourse on the study 

countryman the late dr thomas young had esta 
blished a principle in optics which regarded as a 
physical law has hardly its equal for beauty sim 
plicity and extent of application in the whole circle 
of science considering the manner in which the 
vibrations of two musical soimds arriving at once at 
the ear affect the sense with an impression of sound 
or silence according as they conspire or oppose 
each others effects he was led to the idea that 
the same ought to hold good with light as with 
sound if the theory which makes light analogous to 
sound be the true one and that therefwe two raya 
of light setting off from the same origin at the same 
instant and arriving at the same place by different 
routes ought to strengthen or wholly or partially 
destroy each others effects according to the differ 
ence in length of the routes described by them 
that two lights should in any circumstances com 
bine to produce darkness may be considered strange 
but is literally true and it had even been noticed 
long ago as a singular and unaccountable ct by 
grimaldi in his experiments on the inflection a£ 
light the experimental means by which dr young 
confirmed this principle which is known in optics 
by the name of the inteiferenc of the rays of kght 
were as simple and satisctory as the principle 
itself is beautiful but the verifications of it drawn 
firom the explanation it affords of phenomena appa 
rently the most remote are still more so newtona 
colours of thin films were the first phenomena to 
which its author plied it with full success its 
next remarkable application was to those of diffirao 



of katural philosophy 

£on of which in the hands of m presnel a late 
eminent french geometer it also furnished a com 
plete expknation and that too in cases to which 
newtons hypothesis could not apparently be madd 
to apply and through a con plication of circum 
stances which might afford a very severe test of 
any hrpotheis 

 a simple and beautiful experiment on the 
interferences of polarized light due to fresnel and 
arago enabled them to bring dr youngs law to 
bear on the colours produced by crystallized plates 
in a polarized beam and by so doing afforded a 
key to all the intricacies of these magnificent but 
complex phenomena nothing now was wanting to 
a rational theory of double refraction but to frame 
an hypothesis of some mode in which light might

medium supposed to convey it in such a way as not 
to be contradictory to any of the fiicts nor to 
the general laws of dynamics this essential idea 
without which every thing that had been before 
done would hare been incomplete was also fur 
nished by dr young who with a sagacity which 
would have done honour to newton himself had 
declared that to accommodate the doctrine of 
huyghens to the phenomena of polarized light it is 
necessary to conceive the mode of propagation of 
a luminous impulse through the ether differently 
from that of a sonorous one through the air in the 
latter the particles of the air advance and recede 
in the former those of the ether must be supposed 
to irembie laterally

 taking this as the groundwork of hig 
reasoning fresnel succeeded in erecting on it a 
theory of polarization and double raction so 
happy in its adiitation to facts and in the coin 
cidence with experience of results deduced from it 
by the most intricate analysis that it is difficult to 
conceive it unfounded if it be so it is at least the 
most curiously artificial system that science has yet 
witnessed and whether it be so or not so long as 
it serves to group together in one comprehensive 
point of view a mass of facts almost infinite in 
number and variety to reason from one to another 
and to establish analogies and relations between 
them on whatever hypothesis it may be founded 
or whatever arbitrary assumptions it may make 
respecting structures and modes of action it can 
never be regarded as other than a most real and 
important accession to our knowledge 

 still it is by no means impossible that the 
newtonian theory of light if cultivated with equal 
diligence with the huyghenian might lead to an 
equally plausible explanation of phenomena now 
regarded as beyond its reach m biot is the au 
thor of the hrpothesis we have already mentioned 
of a rotatory motion of the pjarticles of light about 
their axes he has employed it only for a very 
limited purpose but it might doubtless be carried 
much farther and by admitting only the regular 
emission of the luminous particles at equal intervals 
of time and in similar states of motion from the 
shining body which does not seem a very forced sup 
position all the phenomena of interference at least

would be readily enough explained without the ad 
mission of an ether 

 the optical examination of crystallized 
substances affords one among many fine examples 
of the elucidation which every branch of science is 
capable of affording to every other the indefa 
tigable researches of dr brewster and others have 
shown that the phenomena exhibited by polarized 
light in its transmission through crystals afford a 
certain indication of the most important points 
relating to the structure of the crystals themselves 
and thus become most valuable characters by which 
to recognise their internal constitution it was 
newton who first showed of what importance as a 
physical character — as the indication of other pro 
perties— the action of a body on light might become 
but the characters afforded by the use of polarized 
light as an instrument of experimental enquiry are 
so marked and intimate that they may almost be 
said to have furnished us with a kind of intellectual 
sense by which we are enabled to scrutinize the 
internal arrangement of those wonderful structures 
which nature builds up by her refined and invisible 
architecture with a delicacy eluding our conception 
yet with a symmetry and beauty which we are never 
weary of admiring in this point of view the science 
of optics has rendered to mineralogy and crystallo 
graphy services not less important than to astronomy 
by the invention of the telescope or to natural his

 astronomy as has been observed in the 
former part of this discourse as a science of obse 
ation had made considerable progress among the 
ancients indeed it was the odij branch of jjsical 
science which could be regarded as having been cul 
tivated by them with any degree of assiduity or real 
success the chaldean and egyptian records had 
furnished materials from which itk motions of the 
sun and moon could be calculated with sufficient ex 
actness for the prediction of eclipses t and some re 
markable cycles or periods of years in which the 
lunar eclipses return in very nearly the same order 
had been ascertamed by observation considering 
the extreme imperfection of their means of measuring 
time and space this was perhaps as much as could 
have been expected at that early period and it was 
followed up for a while in a philosophical spirit of 
just speculaticm which if continued could hardly 
have iiled to lead to sound and important conclu 
sions 

 unfortunately however the philosophy of 
aristotle laid it down as a principle that the celestial 
motions were regulated by laws proper to themselvesi 
and bearing no affinity to those which prevail on

earth by thus drawing a hroad and impassable line 
f separation between celestial and terrestrial me 
chanics it placed the former altogether out of the 
pale of experimental research while it at the same 
time impeded the progress of the latter by the as 
sumption of principles respecting natural and un 
natural motions hastily adopted from the most 
superficial and cursory remark undeserving even 
the name of observation astronomy therefore con 
tinued for ages a science of mere record in which 
theory had no part except in so far as it attempted 
to conciliate the inequalities of the celestial motions 
with that assumed law of uniform circular revoluticxi 
which was alone considered consistent with the per 
fection of the heavenly mechanism hence arose 
an unwieldy if not selfcontradictory mass of hjrpo 
thetical motions of sim moon and planets in circles 
whose centres were carried round in other circles 
and these again in others without end — cycle on 
epicycle orb on orb — till at length as observation 
grew more exact and fresh epicycles were continually 
added the absurdity of so cumbrous a mechanism 
became too palpable to be borne doubts were ex 
pressed to which the sarcasm of a monarch gave a 
currency they might not have obtained in a period 
when men scarcely dared trust themselves to think 
and at length copernicus promulgating his own or 
reviving the ithagorean doctrine which places 
the sim in the centre of our system gave to astrch 
nomy a simplicity which contrasted with the com 
plication of the preceding views at once commanded

 an elegant writer whom we have before 
had occasion to quote has briefly and neatly ac 
counted for the conilised notions which so long pre 
rtaled respecting the constitution of our system 
and the difficulty experienced in acquiring a true 
notion of the disposition of its parts we see it 
he observes not in ptauf but in sechonj the 
reason of this is that our point of observation 
lies in its general plane but the notion we aim at 
jryrming of it is not that of its section but of its plan 
this is as if we should attempt to read a book or 
make out the countries on a map with the eye on a 
level with the paper we can only judge directly 
of the distances of objects by their sizes or rather 
of their change of distance by their change of size 
neither have we any means of ascertaining otherwise 
than indirectly even their positions one among the 
other from their apparent places as seen by us now 
the variations in apparent size of the sun and mocm 
are too small to admit of exact measure without the 
use of the telescope and the bodies of the planets 
cannot even be distinguished as having any distinct 
size with the naked eye 

 the copemican system once admittedhow 
ever this difficulty of conception at least is effectu 
ally got over and it becomes a mere problem of geo 
metry and calculation to determine from the observed 
places of a planet its real orbit about the sun and 
the other circumstances of its motion this kepler 
accomplished for the orbit of mars which he ascer 
tained to be an ellipse having the sun in one of its 
foci and the same law being extended by inductivi

analogy to all the planets was found to be verified in 
the case of each this with the other remarkable 
laws which are usually cited in physical astronomy 
by the name of keplers laws constitute undoubt 
edly the most important and beautiful stem of 
geometrical relations which have ever been disco 
vered by a mere inductive process independent of 
any consideration of a theoretical kind they com 
prise within them a compendium of the motions of 
all the planets and enable us to assign their places 
in their orbits at any instant of time past or to come 
disregarding their mutual perturbations provided 
certain purely geometrical problems can be numeri 
cally resolved 

 it was not however till long after keplers 
time that the real importance of these laws could ht 
felt regarded in themselves they ofiered it true 
a fine example of regular and harmonious disposition 
in the greatest of all the works of creation and a 
striking contrast to the cumbersome mechanism of 
the crudes and epicycles whidi preceded them but 
there their utility seemed to terminate and indeed 
kepler was reproached and not without a semblance 
of reason with having rendered the actual cal 
culation of the places of the planets more difficult 
than before the resources of geometry bemg then 
inadequate to resolve the problems to whidi the 
strict application of his laws gave rise 

 the first result of the invention of the

single glance that disposition of parts which in the 
planetary system itself is discerned only by the eye of 
reason and imagination see kepler had the 
satisction of seeing it ascertained that the law which 
he had discovered to connect the tunes of revolution 
of the planets with their distances from the sun holds 
good also when apfdied to the periods of circulation 
of these little attendants round the citre of their 
principal thus demonstrating it to be something 
more than a mere empirical rule and to depend on 
die intimate nature of planetary motion itself 

 it had been objected to the doctrine of 
ccmicus that were it true venus should appear 
sometimes homed like the moon to this he an 
swered by admitting the conclusion and averrii 
that should we ever be le to see its actual shape 
it wondd appear so it is easy to imagine with what 
£me the application would strike every mind when 
tibe telescope confirmed this prediction and showed 
the planet just as both the philosopher and his ob 
jectors had agreed it ought to appear the history 
of science affords perhaps only one instance analogous 
to this when dr hutton expounded his theory of 
the consolidation of rocks by the application ofheat 
at ft great depth below the bed of the ocean and 
especially of that of marble by actual fusion it was 
objected that whatever might be the case with 
others with calcareous or marble rocks at least it 
was impossible to grant such a cause of ccmsotid

converts it into quicklime by driving off the car

to this he replied that the pressure under whidi 
the heat was applied would prevent the escape of 
the carbonic acid and that being retained it might 
be expected to give that fusibility to the compound 
which the simple quicklime wanted the next 
generation saw this anticipation converted into an 
observed fact and verified by the direct experiments 
of sir james hall who actually succeeded in melt

 kepler among a number of vague and 
even wild speculations on the causes of the motions 
whose laws he had developed so beautifidly and 
with so much patient labour had obtained a glimpse 
of the general law of the inertia of matter as i 
plicable to the great masses of the heavenly bodies 
as well as to those with which we are conversant 
on the earth after kepler galileo while he gave 
the finishing blow to the aristotelian dogmas whidi 
erected a barrier between the laws of celestial and 
terrestrial motion by his powerful argument and 
caustic ridipule contributed by his investigations 
of the laws of falling bodies and the motions of pro 
jectiles to lay the foundation of a true system of 
dynamics by which motions could be determined 
from a knowledge of the forces producing them 
and forces from the motions they produce hooke 
went yet farther and obtained a view so distinct of 
the mode in which the planets might be retained 
in their orbits by the suns attraction that had his 
mathematical attainments been equal to his fdiilo 
sophical acumen and his scientific pursuits been

less yarious and desultory it can hardly be doubted 
that he would have arrived at a knowledge of the 
law of gravitation 

 but every thing which had been done to 
wards this great end before newton could only be 
regarded as smoothing some first obstacles and 
preparing a state of knowledge in which powers 
like his could be efipectually exerted his wonderful 
combination of mathematical skill with physical 
research enabled him to invent at pleasure new and 
unheardof methods of investigating the effects of 
those causes which his clear and penetrating mind 
detected in operation whatever department of 
science he touched he may be said to have formed 
afresh ascending by a series of closecompacted 
inductive arguments to the highest axioms of dy 
namical science he succeeded in applying them to 
the complete explanation of all the great astronomi 
cal phenomena and many of the minuter and more 
enigmatical ones in doing this he had every thing 
to create the mathematics of his age proved 
totally inadequate to grapple with the numerous 
difficulties which were to be overcome but this 
so far from discoiuing him served only to afford 
new opportunities for the exertion of his genius 
which in the invention of the method of fluxions 
or as it is now more generally called the differential 
calculus has supplied a means of discovery bearing 
the same proportion to the methods previously in 
use that the steamengine does to the medianical 
powers employed before its invention of the optical

whichever way we turn our view we find oursecr 
compeued to bow before his genius and to assign 
to the name of newton a place in our reneration 
which belongs to no other in the annals c science

human reason as apdied to such objects every

as necessary consequences from the same general 
law of force and how the orbits of comets them 
selves are only particular cases of planetary move

disturbing action how tides arise from the unequal 
attraction of the sun as well as of the moon on the 
earth and the ocean which surrounds it and lastly 
how the precession of the equinoxes is a necessary 
consequence of the very same law 

 the immediate successors of newton found 
full occupation in verifying his discoveries and in 
extending and improving the mathematical methods 
which it had now become manifest were to prove the 
keys to an inexhaustible treasure of knowledge the 
simultaneous but independent discovery of a me 
thod of mathematical investigation in every respect 
similar to that of newton by leibnitz while it 
created a degree of national jealousy which can now 
only be pitied had the effect of stimulating the 
continental geometers to its cultivation and im 
pressing on it a character more entirely independent 
of the ancient geometry to which newton was 
peculiarly attached it was fortunate for science 
that it did so for it was speedily found that with 
one fine exception on the part of our countryman 
maclaurin followed up after a long interval by the 
late professor robison of edinburgh with equal 
elegance the geometry of newton was like the 
bow of ulysses which none but its master could 
bend and that to render his methods available 
beyond the points to which he himself carried them

the situation of lookers on while their contiaental 
neighbours both in germany and france were push

be no doubt of the most interesting and instructive 
phenomena being sooner or later brought to light 
the minute examination of them with powerful 
telescopes and with delicate instruments for the 
determination of their places has indeed already 
produced immense catalogues and masses of observ 
ations in which thousands of stars invisible to the 

 

naked eye are registered and has led to the dis 
covery of innumerable important and curious facts 
and disclosed the existence of whole classes of ce 
lestial objects of a nature so wonderful as to give 
room for unbounded speculation on the extent and 
construction of the universe 

 among these perhaps the most remarkable 
are the revolving double stars or stars which to 
the naked eye or to inferior telescopes iqpear 
single but if examined with high magnifying pow 
ers are found to consist of two individuals placed 
almost close together and which when carefully

is compelled to acknowledge its weakness and to feel 
that no conception the wildest imagination can form 
will bear the least comparison with the intrinsic 
greatness of the subject 

geology 

 the researches of physical astronomy are 
confessedly incompetent to carry us back to the 
origin of our system or to a period when its state 
was in any great essential different from what it is at 
present so far as the causes now in action go and 
 far as our calculations will enable us to estimate 
their effects we are equally unable to perceive in 
the general phenomena of the planetary system 
either the evidence of a beginning or the prospect 
of an end geometers as already stated have de 
monstrated that in the midst of all the fluctuations 
which can possibly take place in the elements of the 
orbits of the planets by reason of their mutual at 
traction the general balance of the parts of the 
system will always be preserved and every de 
parture from a mean state periodically compensated 
but neither the researches of the physical astro 
nomer nor those of the geologist give us any 
ground for regarding our system or the globe we 
inhabit as of eternal duration on the contrary 
there are circumstances in the physical constitution 
of our own planet which at least obscurely point to 
an origin and a formation however remote since it 
has been foimd that the figure of the earth is not 



 discourse on the study 

obular but elliptical and that its attraction is such 
as requires us to admit the interior to be more dense 
than the exterior and the density to increase with 
sbme degree of regularity from the surface towards 
the centre and thaty in layers arranged elliptically 
round the centre circumstances which could scarcely 
happen without some such successive deposition of 
materials as would enable pressure to be propagated 
with a certain degree of freedom from one part of 
the mass to another even if we should hesitate to 
admit a state of primitive fluidity 

 but from such indications nothing distinct 
can be concluded and if we would speculate to any 
purpose on a former state of our globe and on the suo 
cession of events which from time to time may have 
changed the condition and form of its surce we 
must confine our views within limits far more 
restricted and to subjects much more within the 
reach of our capacity than either the creation of the 
world or its assumption of its present figure these 
indeed were favourite speculations with a race of 
geologists now extinct but the science itself has 
undergone a total change of character even within 
the last half century and is brought at length 
effectually within the list of the inductive sciences 
geologists now no longer bewilder their imaginations 
with wild theories of the formation of the globe 
from chaos or its passage through a series of hypo 
thetical transformations but rather aim at a careful 
and accurate examination of the records of its former 
state which they find indelibly impressed on the 
great features of its actual sorce and to the 



of natural philosophy 

evidences of former life and habitation which or 
ganised remains imbedded and preserved in its 
strata indisputably afford 

 records of this kind are neither few nor 
vague and though the obsoleteness of their language 
when we endeavour to interpret it too minutely may 
and no doubt often does lead to misapprension 
still its general meaning is on the whole unequi 
vocal and satisfiurtory such records teach us in 
terms too plain to be misunderstood that the whole 
or nearly the whole of our present lands and con 
tinents were formerly at the bottom of the sea 
where they received deposits of materials from the 
wearing and degradation of other lands not now 
existing and mished receptacles for the remains 
of marine animals and plants inhabiting the ocean 
above them as well as for similar spoils of the land 
washed down into its bosom 

 these remains are occasionally brought 
to light and their examination has afforded indubi 
table evidence of the former existence of a state of 
animated nature widely different from what now 
obtains on the globe and of a period anterior to that 
in which it has been the habitation of man or 
rather indeed of a series of periods of unknown 
duration in whidi both land and sea teemed with 
forms of animal and vegetable life which have suc 
cessively disiqppeared and given place to others 
and these again to new races approximating gra 
dually more and more nearly to those which now in 
habit them and at length comprehending species 
which have their counterparts existing

thus wonderfully preserved like ancient medals and 
inscriptions in the ruins of an empire afford a sort 
of rude chronology by whose aid the successive de 
positions of the strata in which they are found may 
be marked out in epochs more or less definitely 
terminated and each characterized by some pe 
culiarity which enables us to recognise the deposits 
of any period in whatever part of the world they 
may be found and so far as has been hitherto 
investigated the order of succession in which these 
deposits have been formed appears to have been 
the same in every part of the globe 

 many of the strata which thus bear evi 
dent marks of having been deposited at the bottom 
of the sea and of course in a horizontal state are 
now found in a position highly inclined to the ho 
rizon and even occasionally vertical and they 
oflen bear evident marks of violence in their bend 
ing and fracture in the dislocation of parts which 
were once contiguous and in the existence of vast 
collections of broken fragments which afford every 
proof of great violence having been used in accom 
plishing some at least of the changes which have 
taken place 

 besides the rocks which carry this in 
ternal evidence of submarine deposition are nuiny 
which exhibit no such proofs but on the contrary 
hold out every appearance of owing their origin to 
volcanoes or to some other mode of igneous action 
and in every part of the world and among strata 
of all ages there occur evidences of such action so 
abundant and on such a scale as to point out the 
volcano and the earthquake as agents which may 



of natural philosophy 

have been instrumental in the production of those 
changes of level and those violent dislocations 
which we perceive to have taken place 

 at all events in accounting for tliose 
changes geologists have no longer recourse as for 
merly to causes purely hrpothetical such as 
a shifting of the earths axis of rotation bringing 
the sea to overflow the land by a change in the 
place of the longer and shorter diameters of the 
spheroidal figure nor to tides produced by the at 
traction of comets suddenly approaching very near 
the earth nor to any other fanciful and arbitrarily 
assumed hrpothees but rather endeavour to con 
fine themselves to a careftd consideration of causes 
evidently in action at present with a view to ascer 
tain how far they in the first instance are capable 
of accounting for the facts observed and thus legi 
timately bringing into view as residual phenomena 
those effects which cannot be so accounted for 
when this shall have been in some measure accom 
plished we shall be able to pronounce with greater 
security than at present respecting the necessity of 
admitting a long succession of tremendous and 
ravaging catastrophes and cataclysms — epochs of 
terrific confusion and violence which many geo 
logists perhaps with justice regard as indispens 
able to the explanation of the existing features of 
the world we shall learn to distinguish between 
the effects which require for their production the 
sudden application of convulsive and firacturing 
efforts and those probably not less extensive 
changes which may have been produced by forces 
equally or more powerful but acting with less irre

none of those interreffnumsi of chaotic anarchy whidi 
we are apt to think perhaps erroneously great di 
figurements of an order so beautiful and harmonious 
as that of nature 

 but to estimate justly the effects of 
causes now in action in geology is no easy task 
there is no ci priori or deductive process by whidi 
we can estimate the amount of the annual erosion 
for instance of a continent by the action of mieteoric 
agents rain wind frost c nor the quantity of 
destruction produced on its coasts by the direcl 
violence of the sea nor the quantity of lava thrown 
up per annum by volcanoes over the whole surftce 
of the earth nor any similar effect and to con

painful process if rightly gone into and a veiy fid 
lible one if only partially executed mudi then 
at present must be lefl to opinion and to that sort 
of dearjudging tact which sometimes anticipates 
experience but this ought not to stand in the way 
of our making evecy possible effort to obtain accu 
rate information on such points by which alone 
geology can be rendered if not an experimental 
science at least a science of that kind of active 
observation which forms the nearest approach to it 
where actual experiment is impossible

 what is the actual direction in whioh dianges of

conflicting because imperfect evidence it is ob 
vious that the only way to decide the point is to as 
certain by very precise and careful observations at 
toper stations cm coasts selected at points where 
there exist natural marks not liable to change in 
the course of at least a century the true elevation 
of such marks above the mean level of the sea and 
to multiply these stations sufficiently over the whole

periodical and accidental fluctuations due to tidesi

ferience that while in the latter science it is impos

observation is in consequence limited to a single 
fact in a single moment in the former the records 
of the past are always present — they may be exa 
mined and reexamined as often as we please and 
require nothing but diligence and judgment to put us 
in possession of their whole contents only a very 
small part of the surface bf our globe has however 
been accurately examined in detail and of that small 
portion we are only able to scratch the mere ex 
terior for so we must consider those excavations 
which we are apt to regard as searching the bowels 
of the earth since the deepest mines which have 
been sunk penetrate to a depth hardly surpassing the 
ten thousandth part of the distance between its sur 
face and its centre of course inductions founded 
on such limited examination can only be regarded 
as provisional except in those remarkable cases where 
the same great formations in the same order have been 
recognised in very distant quarters and without ex 
ception this however cannot long be the case tlie 
spirit with which the subject has been prosecuted for 
many years in our own country has been rewarded 
with so rich a harvest of surprising and unexpected

of the examination of the material constituents 

of the world 

minendogy 

s the consideration of the history and struc 
ture of our globe and the examination of the fossil 
contents of its strata lead us naturally to consider 
the materials of which it consists the history 
tliese materials their properties as objects of philo 
 sophical enquiry and their application to the usefiil 
arts and the embellishments of life with the charac 
ters by which they can be certainly distinguished 
one from another form the object of mineralogy 
taken in its most extended sense 

 there is no branch of science which pre 
sents so many points of contact with other depart 
ments of physical research and serves as a connect 
ing link between so many distant points of phi 
losophical speculation as this to the geolcist 
the chemist the optician the crystallogner 
the physician it offers especially the veiy ele 
ments of their knowledge and a field for many of 
their most curious and important enquiries nor 
with the exception of chemistry is there any whidi 
has undergone more revolutions or been exhibited 
in a greater variety of forms to the ancients it 
could scarcely be said to be at all known and up to 
a comparatively recent period nothing could be 



of natural philosophy 

inore imperfect than its descriptions or more in 
artificial and unnatural than its classification the 
more important minerals in the arts indeed those 
used for economical purposes and those from which 
metals were extracted had a certain degree of 
attention paid to them for the sake of their utility 
and commercial value and the precious stones for 
that of ornament but until their crystalline forms 
were attentively observed and shown to be deter 
minate characters on which dependence could be 
placed no mineralogist could give any correct ac 
count of the real distinction between one mineral 
and another 

 it was only however when chemical 
analysis had acquired a certain degree of precision 
and universal applicability that the importance of 
mineralogy as a science began to be recognised and 
the connection between the external characters of 
a stone and its ingredient constituents brought into 
distinct notice among these characters however 
none were found to possess that eminent distinct 
ness which the crystalline form offers a character 
in the highest degree geometrical and affording as 
might be naturally supposed the strongest evidence 
of its necessary connection with the intimate con 
stitution of the substance the fiiu importance of 
this character was however not felt until its con 
nection with the texture or cleavage of a mineral 
was pointed out and even then it required numerous 
and striking instances of the critical discernment of 
haiiy and other eminent mineralogists in predicting 
from the measurements of the angles of crystals 
which had been confounded together that differ

ences would be ibuad to exist in tbeir cheimgd 
compositiodi all which fhroved fully justified in their 
result before the essential value oi this character was 
acknowledgecl this waaaa doubt in great measure 
owing to the high importance set by the gerbua 
mineralogists on those external characters of touch 
sight weighty colour and other sensible qualities 
which are little susceptible with the iception of 
weight of exact determinatiob aod which are sul 
ject to material variations in different specimens of 
the same mineral by degrees however the neces 
sity of ascribing great weight to a character so de 
finite was admitted especially when it was considered 
that the same step which pointed out the intimate 
connection of external form with internal structure 
furnished the mmeralogist with the means of re 
ducing all the forms of which a mineral is susceptible 
under one general type or primitive form and ai 
forded grounds for an elant theoretic account of 
the assumption of definite figures ab tmhom 

 a simple and elegant inventim of drwoi 
laston the reflecting gcmicmoaeter gave a fresh im 
pulse to that view of mineralogy which makes tfae 
crystalline form the essential or leading character 
by putting it in the power of every one by the ex 
amination of even the smallest portion of a broken 
crystal to ascertain and verify thi essential cha 
racter on which the identity of a mineral in tbe 
system of haiiy was made to depend hie aili 
cation of so ready and exact a method speedily led 
to important results and to a still nicer diacrimiik 
ation of mineral spades than could before be at 
tained and the confirmation given to these roaulta 



 chemical analysis stamped them witk a sdenftifit 
ttid decided diaract which they have retained ever 
meek 

 meanwhile the progress made in chemical 

lualysis had led to the important conclusion that 

every chemical compound susceptible of assuming 

the sdid state assumed with it a determinate crys 

lalline form and the progress of optical science 

had shown that die fundamental crystalline form in 

the case at least of transparent bodies drew with it 

a series of tical properties no less curious than int 

portant in relation to the affections of light in its pass 

age through such substances thus in every point 

of view additiia importance became added to this 

character and the study of the crystalline forms 

of bodies in general assumed the form of a separate 

and independent branch of science of whidi the 

geometrical forms of the mineral world constituted 

only a particular case mineralogy however as a 

branch of natural history remains still distinct either 

from optics or crystallography the mineralogist 

is content and thinks he has performed his task if 

not as a natural historian at least as a classifier 

and arranger if he only gives such a characteristic 

description of a mineral as shall efiectually distin 

guiah it from every other and shall enable any one 

who may encounter such a body in any part of the 

world to impose on it its name assign it a place in 

his system and turn to his books for a farther de 

scription of all that the chemist the optician the 

iflidary or the artist may require to know still 

is is no easy matter the laborious researches pf 

the most eminait mineralogists can hardly yet be

said to have effectually accomplished it and its 
difficulty may be appreciated by the small number of 
simple minerals or minerals of perfectly definite and 
wellmarked characters which have been hitherto 
made out nor can this indeed be wondered at 
when we consider that by far the greater portim 
of the rocks and stones which compose the external 
crust of the globe consists of nothing more than 
the accumulated detritus of older rocks in which the 
fragments and powder of an infinite variety of sub 
stances are mingled together in all sorts of varying 
proportions and in such a way as to defy separ 
ation many of these rocks however so com 
pounded occur with sufficient fiequency and uni 
formity of character to have acquired names and to 
have been usefully implied indeed in the latter 
respect minerals of this description fiir surpass all 
the others as objects of natural histoiy there 
fore they are well worthy of attention however 
difficult it may be to assign them a place in any 
artificial arrangement 

 this paucity of simple minerals however 
is probably rather apparent than real and in pro 
portion as the researches of the chemist and crya 
tallographer shall be extended throughout nature 
they will no doubt become much more numerona 
indeed in the great laboratories of nature it can 
hardly be doubted that almost every kind of che 
mical process is going forwards by which com 
pounds of every description are continually forming 
accordingly it is remarked that the lavas and 
ejected scoris of volcanoes are receptacles in which

 the great difficulty which has been expe 
rienced in attempts to classify mineral substances 
by their cheinical constituents has arisen from the 
observed presence in some specimens of minerals 
bearing that general resemblance in other respects 
as well as agreement in form which would seem to 
entitle them to be considered as alike of ingredients 
foreign to the usual composition of the species and 
that occasionally in so large a proportion as to ren 
der it unjustifiable to refer tlieir occurrence to ac 
cidental impurities these cases as well as some 
anomalies observed in the classification of minerak 
by their crystalline forms which seemed to show 
iliat the same substance might occasionally appear 
under two distinct forms as well as some remark 
able coincidences between the forms of substances 
quite distinct from each other in a diemical point of 
view have within a recent period given rise to a 
branch of the science of crystallaphy of a very 
carious and important nature the isomorphwn 
of certain groups of chemical elements has already 
afforded us an example illustrative of the manner in 
which inductions sometimes receive unexpected 
verifications see the laws and relations 
thus brought to light are among the most curious 
and interesting parts of modem science and

an increase of weight takes place — die ashes are 
heavier than the fuel whenever this was observed 
however it was passed carelessly over as arising 
from the escape of phlogiston or tie principle of in 
flammability which was considered as being either 
the element of fire itself or in some way combined 
with it and thus essentially liffkt it is now known 
that the increase of weight is owing to the absorp

makes no difference whether a body having weight 
enters or one having levity escapes but there is

general heads —

substances 
 the developement of the doctrine of latent 
heat by black with its train of important

of the steamengine

proportions on his own experiments and 
those of richter a discovery subsequently 
merged in the greater generality of the 
atomic theory of dalton

of the dificrent chemical elements mainly

upon the general principles of all scientific enquiry

have been naturally preparatory to it and sudi as 
would have led others to it by the prosecution of 
wenzels and richters researches had they been 
duly attended to this is in fact an example and 
a most remarkable one of the effect of that natural 
propensity to generalize and simplify noticed in 
l which if it occasionally leads to overhas 
conclusions limited or disproved by further experi 
ence is yet the legitimate parent of all our most valo 
able and our soundest results instances like thi 
where great and indexed immeasurable steps in 
our knowledge of nature are made at once and 
almost without intellectual effort are well calculated 
to raise our hopes of the future progress of science 
and by pointing out the simplest and most obvious 
combinations as those which are actually found to 
be most agreeable to the harmony of creation to 
hold out the cheering prospect of difficulties dimin 
ishing as we advance instead of thickening around 
us in increasing complexity 

 a consequence of this immediate present 
ation of the law of definite proportions in its most 
general form is that its subordinate laws — those 
which limit its generality in particular cases which 
diminish the number of combinations abstractly 
possible and restrain the indiscriminate mixture of 
elements — remain to be discovered some sudi 
limitations have in fact been traced to a certain 
extent but by no means so far as the importance of 
the subject requires and we have here abundant 
occupation for chemists for some time 

 the determination of the atomic weights 
of the chemical elements like that of other standard

ph jsical data with the utmost exactness is in itself 
a branch of enquiry not only of the greatest im 
portance but of extreme difficulty independent 
of the general reasons for desiring accuracy in this 
respect there is one peculiar to the suliject it 
has been suggested by dr prout and strongly 
insisted on by dr thomson that all the numbers 
representing these weights constituting a scale of 
great extent in which the extremes already known 
are in proportion to each other as to upwards of 
q are simple even multiples of the least of them 
if this be really the case it opens views of fnich 
inqortance as to justify any degree of labour and 
pains in the verification of the law as a purely in 
ductive one but in the actual state of chemical 
analysis with all deference to such high authority 
we confess it appears to us to stand in great need 
of further confirmation since it seems doubtfiil 
whether sudi accuracy has yet been attained as to 
enable us to answer positively for a fraction not 
exceedmg the three or four hundredth part of the 
whole quantity to be determined at least the re 
salts of the first experimenters obtained with the 
greatest care differ often by a greater amount and 
diis degree of exactness at least would be required 
to verify the law satisctorily in the higher parts 
of the scale 

s the mere agitation of such a question 
however points out a class of phenomena in physical 
science of a remote and singular kind and of a veij 
high and refined order which could never become 
known but in an advanced state of science not only 
practical but theoretical — we mean such as coi

sist in observed relations among the data of physic 
which show them to be quantities not arburaruy 
assmned but depending on laws and causes whidi 
they may be the means of at length disclosing 
a remarkable instance of such a relation is the 
curious law which bode observed to obtain in the 
progression of the magnitudes of the several planet 
acy orbits this law was interrupted between ijars 
and jupiter so as to induce him to consider a 
planet as wanting in that interval — a deficiency 
long afterwards strangely supplied by the discovery 
of four new planets in that very interval all of 
whose orbits conrm in dimension to the law in 
question within such moderate limits of error as 
may be due to causes independent of those on which 
the law itself ultimately rests 

 neither is it irrelevant to our subject to 
remark that the progress which has been made in 
this department of chemistry and the considerable 
exactness actually attainable in chemical analysisy 
have been owing in great measure to a circum 
stance which might at first have been hardly con 
sidered likely to exercise much influence on the 
progress of a science — the discovery of platina 
without the resources placed at the ready dispoaal 
of chemists by this invaluable metal it is difficult to 
conceive that the multitude of delicate analytical 
experiments which have been required to construct 
the fabric of existing knowledge could have ever 
been performed this among many such lessons

 one of the chief agents in chemistiy on 
whose proper application and management the 
success of a great number of its enquiries depends 
and many of whose most important laws are di 
dosed to us by phenomena of a chemical nature 
is heat although some of its effects are con 
tinually before our eyes as matters of the most 
common occurrence msomuch that there is scarcely 
any process in the useful arts and manuctures 
which does not call for its intervention and a 
though independent of this high utility and the 
proportionate importance of a knowledge of its 
nature and laws it presents in itself a subject of 
the most curious speculation yet there is scarcely 
any physical agent of which we have so imperfect 
a knowledge whose intimate nature is more hidden 
or whose laws are of such delicate and difficult in 
testigation 

 the word heat generally implies the sens 
ation which we experience on approaching a fire 
but in the sense it carries in physics it denotes the 
cause whatever it be of that sensation and of all 



 natural fhilosopht sll 

the other phenmieiia which arise on the implication 
of fire or of any other heating cause we should 
be greatly deceived if we referred only to sensation 
as an indication of the presence of this cause 
many of those things which excite in our organs 
and especially of those of taste a sensation of heat 
awe this property to chemical stimulants and not 
at all to their being actually hot this error of 
judgment has produced a corresponding confusion 
oi£ language and hence had actually at one period 
crept into physical philosophy a great many illccal 
and absurd conclusions again there are a number 
of chemical agents which from their corroding 
blackening and dissolving or drying up the parts 
of some descriptions of bodies and producing on 
them effects not generally unlike though intrin 
ideally very different from those produced by heat 
are said in loose and vulgar language to bum 
them and this error has even become rooted into 
a prejudice by the fact that some of these agenta 
are capable of becoming actually and truly ao 
during their action on moist substances by reason 
o£ their combination with the water the latter con 
tain thus quicklime and oil of vitriol both ex 
ercise a powerful corrosive action on animal and 
etable substances and both become violently 
hot by their combination with water they are 
therefore set down in vulgar parlance as substances 
of a hot nature whereas in their relations to the 
physical cause of heat they agree with the gene 
rality of bodies similarly constituted

 the nature of heat ha hitherto been 
chiefly studied under the general heads f — 
ist its sources or the phenomena which it usually 

accompanies 
d its communication from its sovyrces to su 
stances capable of receiving it and from these 
to others with a view to discover the laws 
which regulate its distribution through space 
or through the bodies which occupy it 
d its ieffects on eur senses and on uie bodies to 
which it a communicated in its various d 
grees of intsjty by which meao are affirded

ith its intuwate jetotims to the atoms of matter 
as eidubited in its capability of acquiring a

 the most obvious sources of heat are the 
sun fire animal life fermentations violent chemical 
actions of all kinds friction percussion mghtnin 
or the electric discharge in whatever manner pro 
duced the sudden condensation of air and other 
so numerous and so varied as to show the ex 
tensive and important part it has to perform in the 
economy of nature the discoveries of chemists 
however have referred most of these to the general 
head of chemical combination thus fire or the 
combustion of inflammable bodies is nothing more 
thfm a violent chemical action attending the cook 
bination of their ingredients with the oxygen of the 
air animal heat is in like manner referable to a 
process bearing no remote analogy to a slow com

ried off from the system fermentation is nothiog 
ibqpe tiian a decomposition of chemical elemmts 
kosely united and their reunion in a more per 
masient state of combination the analogy between 
ihe sun and terrestrial fire is so natural as to have 
been chosen by newton to exemplify the irresistible 
force of an inence derived from that principle 
but the nature of the sun and the mode in which 
itswonderftd supply of light and heat is maintained 
are involved in a mystery which every discovery that 
has been made either in chemistry or optics so far 
ftom elucidating seems only to render more pn 
fimiad friction as a source of heat is well known 
ire rub our hands to warm them and we grease 
the axles of carriagewheels to prevent their setting 
fire to the wood an accident which in spite of 
bi precaution does sometimes happen but the 
effect of frictkm as a means of producing heat with 
little or no consumption of materials was not fully 
understood till made the sulject of direct expe 
riment by count rumford whose results appear to 
have established the extramdinary fact that an 
unlimited supply of heat may be derived by friction 
from the same materials condensation whether 
of air by pressure or of metds by percussion is 
another powerful source of heat thus iron may 
be so dexterously hammered as to become redhot 
and the rapid condensaticm of a confined portion of 
air will set tmder on fire 

s the most violent heats known are pro 



 discourse ok the study 

duced by the concentration of the solar rays by 
burning glasses— by the combustion of oxygen and 
hydrogen gases mixed in the exact proportion in 
ich they combine to produce water — and by the 
discharge of a continued and copious current of 
electricity through a small conductor as these 
three sources of heat are independent of eadi 
other and each capable of being brought into 
action in a very confined space there seems no 
reason why they might not all three be ajlied at 
once at the same point by which means probably 
effects would be produced infinitely surpassing any 
hitherto witnessed 

 heat is communicated either by radiaikm 
between bodies at a distance or by etmdncikm 
between bodies in contact or between the conti 
guous parts of one and the same body the laws 
of the radiation of heat have been studied with 
great attention and have been found to present 
strong analogies with that of light in some point 
and singular differences in others thus the heat 
which accompanies the suns rays comports itsd 
in all respects like light being subject to similar 
laws of reflection refiaction and even of polarisa 
tion as has been shown by berard yet they are 
not identical with each other sir william hersdid 
having shown by decisive experiments verified bj 
those of sir h englefield that there exist m a 
solar beam both rays of heat which are not lumin 
ous and rays of light which have no heating power 

 llie heat radiated by terrestrial fires and 
by bodies obscurdy hot by whatever means they 
have acquired their heat even by exposure to the 



or haxuaal philosopht s 

sons raj differs tery materiauy from solar beat 

in their power of penetrating transparent substances 

this singular and important difference was first 

noticed by mariotte and afterwards made the sub 

ject of many curious and interesting experiments 

by scheele who found that terrestrial heat or that 

radiated from fires or heated bodies is intercepted 

and detainee by glass or other transparent bodies 

wiule solar heat is not and that being so detained 

it heats them which the latter as it passes freely 

through them is incapable of doing the more 

recent researches of delaroche however hare 

shown that this detention is complete only when 

the temperature of the source of heat is low but 

that as that temperature is higher a portion of the 

heat radiated acquires a power of penetrating glass 

and that the quantity which does so bears con 

tmually a larger and larger proportion to the whole 

as the heat of the radiant body is more intense 

this discovery is very important as it establishes 

a community of nature between solar and terrestrial 

heat while at the same time it leads us to regard 

the actual temperature of the sun as r exceeding 

that of any earthly flame 

 a variety of theories have been firamed to 
account for these curious phenomena but the sub 
ject stands rather in need of further elucidation 
from experiment and is one which merits and will 
probably amply repay the labours of those who may 
hereafter devote their attention to it the theory 
f the radiation of heat in general which seems to 
agree best with the known phenomena is that of 
m prevost who considers all bodies as constantly 



s discuusx on the study 

 

radiating out heat in all directidns and receiving it 
by a similar means of communication from others 
and thus tending in any space filled wholly or in 
part with bodies at various temperatures to esta 
blish an equilibrium or equality of heat in all parts 
hie application of this idea to the explanation of 
the phenomenon of dew we have akeady seen see 
 the laws of such radiation under various 
drcumstimces have been lately investigated in a 
beautiful series of experiments on the cooling of 
bodies by their own radiation in vacuo fay messrs 
ixdong and petit whidi offer some of the best ex 
amples in science of the inductive investigatioa of 
quantitative laws 

 the communication of heat between bodies 
in contact or between the different parts of the 
same body is performed by a process called con 
duction it is in fact only a particular case bf 
radiation as has been explained abo but 
a case so particular as to require a separate and 
independent investigation of its laws the most 
important consideration introduced into the enquiiy 
by this peculiarity is that of time the cotq 
munication of heat by conduction is performed fat 
the most part with extreme slowness while that 
performed by direct nuliation is probably not less 
rapid than the propagation of light itself tbe 
analysis of the delicate and difficult points wbidi 
arise in the investigation of this subject in its 
reduction to direct geometrical treatment has been 
executed with admirable success by the late baron 
founier whose recent lamented death has deprived 
science of an ornament it could ill spare thinned

as its ranks have been within the last few years 
this acute philosopher and profound mathe 
matician has developed in a series of elaborate 
memoirs presented to the french institute the 
laws of the communication of heat through the 
interior of solid masses placed under the influence 
of any external heating and cooling causes and has 
in particular applied his results to the conditions on 
which the maintenance of the actual observed 
temperature on the earths surface depends to ihe 
possible influence of a supposed central heat on our 
climates and to the determination of the actual 
amount of the heat derived to us from the sun or 
at least that portion of it on which the difference of 
the seasons depends 

 the principal effects of heat are the sens 
ations of warmth or cold consequent on its entry 
or egress into or out of our bodies the dilatation it 
causes in the dimensions of all substances in which 
it is accumulated the changes of state it produces 
ih the melting of solids and the conversion of 
them and of liquids into vapour and the chemical 
changes it performs by actual decompositions 
effected in the intimate molecules of various sub 
stances especially those of which vegetables and 
animals are composed to which we may add die 
production of electric phenomena und certain 
circumstances in the contact of metals and the 
developement of electric polarity in crystallised sub 
stances 

 cold has been considered by some as a 
positive quality the effect of a cause antagonist to 
that of heat but this idea seems now with perhape 



 discourse on the study 

a single exception to be universally abandoned 
the sensation of cold is as easily explicable by th 
passage of heat outwards through the surface of the 
body as that of heat by its ingress from without 
and the experiments cited in proof of a radiation of 
odd are all perfectly explained by prevosts theory 
of reciprocal interchange it is remarkable how 
ever how very limited our means of producing in 
tense cold are compared with those we possess of 
effecting the accumulation of heat in bodies hug 
m one of the strongest argmnents adducible in £ayoxa 
of the doctrines of those who maintain the possibility 
of exhausting the heat of a body altogether and 
leaving it in a state absolutely devoid of it but we 
ought to consider that the known methods of gene 
rating heat chiefly turn on the production of che 
mical combinations we may easily conceive there 
fore that to obtain equally powerful corresponding 
frigorific effects we ought to possess the means dt 
effecting a disunion equally extensive and rapid be 
tween such elements actually combined as have 
already produced heat by their union this hoir 
ever we can only accomplish by engaging them m 
combinations still more energetic that is to say in 
which we may reasonably expect more heat to be 
produced by the new combmation than would be 
destroyed or abstracted by the proposed decompod 
tion chemistry however unaided by electric 
agency affords no means of suddenly breaking the 
union of two elements and presenting both in an us 
combined state a certain analogy to such disuniofn 
however and its consequences may be traced in the 
sudden expansion of condensed gases frhn a liquid 



of natural philosophy 

state into vapour which is the most powerful source 
of cold known 

 the dilatation of bodies by heat forms the 
subject of that branch of science allied pyrometry 
there is no body but is capable of being penetrated 
by heat though some with greater others with less 
rapidity and being so penetrated all bodies with a 
ery few exceptions and those depending cm very pe 
collar circumstanceare dilated by it in bulk though 
with a great diversity in the amount of dilatation 
produced by the same degree of heat of the several 
forms of natural bodies gases and vapours are ob 
served to be most dilatable liquids next and solids 
least of all the dilatation of solids has been made 
a subject of repeated and careful measurement by 
several experimenters among whom smeatoo 
lavoisier and laplace are the principal the 
remarkable discovery of the unequal dilatation of 
crystallised bodies by mitscherlich has already 
been spoken of that of gases and vapours 
was examined about the same time by ddton and 
gaylussac who both arrived independently at the 
conclusion of an equal dilatability subsisting in 
them au which constitutes one of the most remarji 
afale points in their history 

 the dilatation of air by heat affords per 
faps the most unexceptionable means known of 
measuring degrees of heat the thermometer as 
ooriginally constructed by cornelius drebell was an 
air thermometer those now in common use 
measure accessions of heat not by the degree of 
dilatation of air but of mercury it has been shown 
by the researches of dulong and petit that its indi 



s discourse ok the stud 

cations coincide exactly with that of the airdiermo 
meter in moderate temperatures though at veiy 
devated ones they exhibit a sensible and even 
considerable deviation by this instrument whidi 
owes its present convenience and utility to the 
happy idea of newton who first thought of fixing 
determinate points on its scale we are enabled to 
estimate or at least identify the degrees of heat 
and thereby to investigate with accuracy the laws 
of its communication and its other properties were 
we sure that equal additions of heat produced equal 
increments of dimension in any substance the indi 
cations of a thermometer would afford a true and 
secure imosure of the quantity present but this is 
so far from being the case that we are nearly in 
total ignorance on this important point a circum 
stance which throws the greatest difficulty in the way 
of all theoretical reasoning and even of experi 
mental enquiry the laws of the dilatation of liquids 
in consequence of this deficiency of necessary pre 
liminary knowledge are still involved in great ob 
scurity notwithstanding the pains which have been 
bestowed on them by the elaborate experiments and 
calculations of gilpin blagden deluc dalton gaj 
lussac and biot 

 the moat striking and important of the 
effects of heat consist however in the liquefaction of 
solid substances and the conversion of the liquids 
so produced into vapour there is no solid substance 
known which by a sufficiently intense heat may 
not be melted and finally dissipated in vapour and 
this analogy is so extensive and cogent that we 
not but suppose that all those bodies which 



of natural philosophy 

liquid under ordinary circumstances owe their li 
quidity to heat and would freeze or become solid is 
their heat could be sufficiently reduced in many 
we see this to be the case in ordinary winters for 
some severe frosts are requisite others freeze only 
with the most intense artificial colds and some 
have hitherto resisted all our endeavours yet the 
number of these last is few and they will probably 
cease to be exceptions as our means of producing 
cold become enlarged 

 a similar analogy leads us to conclude that 
ah aeriform fluids are merely liquids kept in the 
state of vapour by heat many of them have been 
actually condensed into the liquid state by cold ac 
companied with violent pressure and as our means 
of applying these causes of condensation have im 
proved more and more refractory ones have succes 
sively yielded hence we are fairly entitled to 
extend our conclusion to those which we have not 
yet been able to succeed with and thus we are led 
to regard it as a general ct that the liquid and 
aeriform or vaporous states are entirely dependent 
on heat that were it not for this cause there 
would be nothing but solids in nature and that on 
the other hand nothing but a sufficient intensity of 
heat is requisite to destroy the cohesion of every 
substance and reduce all bodies first to liquids and 
then into vapour 

 but solids themselves by the abstraction 
of heat shrink in dimension and at the same time 
become harder and more brittle yielding less to 
pressure and permitting less separation between 
their parts by tension these facts coupled with 

y

the greater compressibilitj of uqukb and the still 
greater of gases strony induce us to believe that 
it is heat and heat alone which holds the partides 
of all bodies at that distance from each other whidb 
is necesscffy to allow of compression whidi in tci 
gives them their elasticity and acts as the anta 
gonist force to their mutual attraction which would 
otherwise draw them into actual contact and retain 
them in a state oi absolute immobility and impene 
trabilitj thus we learn to regard heat as one of 
the great maintaining powers of the universe and to 
attadi to all its laws and relations a dree of in 
portance which may justly entitle them to the most 
assiduous enquiry 

 it was first ascertained by dr black that 
when heat produces the liquection of a solid or 
the conversion of a liquid into vapour the liqoid oe 
the viwur resulting is no hoiiar than tke scd or 
liquid from vrhick it was produced though a great 
deal of heat has been expended in producing this 
effect and has actually entered into the substance 

 hence he chrew the conclusion that it baa 
become latmli and continues to exist in the product 
maintainmg it in its new state without increasing 
its temperature he further proved that when the 
vapour condenses or the liquid freezes this latent 
hat is again given out from it this great dia 
covery with its natural and hardly less important 
concomitant that of the difference of specific heats 
in different bodies or the different quantities of beat 
they require to raise their temperature equally are 
the chief reasons for regarding heat as a material 
substance in a more decided manner thi light 



or vatural piiilosopht 

with which in its radiant state it holds so dose an 
analogy 

 the sulgect of latent heat has been far less 
attentively studied than its great practical import 
aoe would appear to demand when we consider 
that it is to this part of physical science that the 
theory of the steamengine is mainly referable and 
that material imprordents nuiy not unreasonably 
be expected in that wonderful instrument from a 
ttore extended knowledge than we possess of the 
latent heats of different rapours this is not the 
case however with the subject of specific heat 
which was followed up immediately after its first 
promulgation with diligence by irvine and after a 
m£ interval by lavoisier and laplace as well as 
bj our countrjrman crawfurd who determined the 
cific heats of many substances both solid and 
liikl after a considerable period of inactivity the 
subject was agam resumed by delaroche and berard 
and sidwequently by dulong and petit the result of 
whose investigations has been the inductive esta 
blishnsent of one of those simple and elegant phy 
sical laws tfrhich carry with them if not their own 
evidence at least their own recommendation to our 
belief as being in unison with every thing we know 
of the harmony of nature the law to which we 
dqude is this that the atoms of all the sunple 
dhemical dements have ftaetly the same cicity 
for heat or are ail effomy heated or cooled by equal 
accessions or idbstraetions of heat it is only among 
laws like this that we can expect to find a dew ca

separate branches of science are at length effectually 
blended this is perhaps the most satisctory 
result which the experimental sciences have ever 
yet attained all the phenomena of magnetic po 
larity attraction and repulsion have at length been 
resolved into one general fact that two currents of 
electricity moving in the same direction repel and 
in contrary directions attract each other tlie 
phenomena of the conmiunication of magnetism and 
what is called its induced state alone remain un

been developed by m ampere under uie name of 
electrodynamics holds out a hope that this dif

subject be at length completely merged as r as the 
consideration of the acting causes goes in the more 
general one of electricity this however does not 
prevent magnetism from maintaining its separate 
importance as a department of physical enquiry 
having its own peculiar laws and relations of the 
highest practical interest which are capable d 
being studied quite apart from all consideration of its 
electrical origin and not only so but to study them 
with advantage we must proceed as if that origin 
were totally unknown and at least up to a certain 
point and that a considerably advanced one conduet 
our enquiries into the subject on the same inductive 
principles as if this branch of physics were

 iron and its oxides and alloys were for a 
long time the only substances considered susceptible 
of magnetism the loadstone was even one of the 
examples produced by bacon of that class of phy 
sical instances to which he applies the term in 
stantiae monodicbd — singidar ingtances and the 
history of magnetism affords a beautiful comment on 
his remark on instances of this sort nor should 
our enquiries he observes into their nature be 
broken off till the properties and qualities found in 
such things as may be esteemed wonders in nature 
are reduced and comprehended imder some certain 
law so that all irregularity or singularity may be 
found to depend upon some common form and the 
wonder only rest in the exact differences degrees 
or extraordinary concurrence and not in the species 
itself the discovery of the magnetism of nickel 
which though inferior to that of iron is still con 
siderable that of cobalt yet feebler and that of 
titanium which is only barely perceptible have 
effectually broken down the imaginary limit between 
iron and the other materials of the world and esta 
blished the existence of that general law of conti 
nuity which it is one chief business of philosophy 
to trace throughout nature the more recent dis 
coveries of m arago mentioned in have 
completed this generalization by showing that there 
 no substance but which under proper circum 
stances is capable of exhibiting unequivocal signs of 
the magnetic virtue and to obliterate all traces of 
that line of separation which was once so broad we 
are now enabled by the great discovery of oersted 
to communicate at and during pleasure to a coiled

wire of any metal indifferent j all the properties of 
a magnet — its attraction repulsion and polari 
and that even in a more intense degree than was pre 
viously thought to be possible in the best natural 
magnets in short in this cas and in this case 
only perhaps in science have we arrived at that 
point which bacon seems to have understood by the 
discovery of forms the form of any nature 
says he is such that where it is the given nature 
must infallibly be the form therefore is perpe 
tually present when that nature is present ascer 
tains it universally and acoompanies it every where 
again this form is suqh that when removed the 
given nature infallibly vanishes lastly a true form 
is such as can deduce a given nature from some 
essential property which resides in many things 

 magnetism is remarkable in another im 
portant point of view it offers a prominent or 
 glaring instance of that quality in nature which 
is termed jman and that under circum 
stances which peculiarly adapt it for the study of 
this quality it does not appear that the ancienta 
had any knowledge of this property of the magnet 
though its attraction of iron was well known to them 
the first mention of it in modem times cannot be 
traced earlier than usoy though it was probably 
known to the chinese before that time the po 
larity of the magnet consists in this that if suft 
pended freely one part of it will invariably direct 
itself towards a certain point in the horizon the 
other towards the opposite point and that if two 
magnets so suspended be brought near each cither 
there will take place a mutual action in consequence 



of katuftal philosopht s 

of wludi the positions of both will be disturbed in 
lihe same manner as would happen if the corre 
sponding parts of each repelled and those oppositely 
directed attracted each other and by properly 
varying the experiment it is found that they really 
do so if a small magnet freely suspended be 
brout into the neighbourhood of a larger one it 
will take a position depending on the position of the 
poies of the larger one with respect to its point of 
suspension and it has been ascertained that these 
and all other phenomena exhibited by magnets in 
their mutual attractions and repulsions are ex 
plicable on the supposition of two forces or virtues 
lodged in the particles of the magnets the one 
predominating at one end the other at the other 
and such that each particle shall attract those in 
which the opposite virtue to its own prevails and 
repel those in which a simihr one resides with a 
force proportional to the inverse square of their 
mutual distance 

 the direction in which a magnetic bar or 
needleofsteelfreely suspended places itself hasbeen 
ascertidned to be different at different points of the 
earths surface in some places it points exactly north 
and south in others it deviatesfrom this direction more 
¦or less and at some actually stands at right angles 
to it this remarkable phenomenon which is called 
the variation of the needle and which was discovered 
by sebastian cabot in the year is accompanied 
with another called the dip noticed by robert nor 
man in it consists in a tendency of a needle 
nicely balimced on its centre when unmagnetized 
to dip or point downwards when rendered magnetic

towards a point below the horizon and situated 
within the earth by tracing the variation and dip 
over the wiiole surface of the globe it has been 
found that these phenomena take place as they 
would do if the earth itself were a great magnet 
having its poles deeply situated below the surface 
and what is very remarkable possessing a slow 
motion within it in consequence of which neither 
the variation nor dip remain constantly the same at 
the same place the laws of this motion are at 
present unknown but the discovery of electro 
magnetism by rendering it almost certain that the 
earths magnetism is merely an effect of the con 
tinual circulation of great quantities of electricity 
round it in a direction generally corresponding with 
that of its rotation have dissipated the greater part 
of the mystery which hung over these phenomena 
since a variety of causes both geological and others 
may be imagined which may produce considerable 
deviations in the intensity and partial ones in the 
direction of sudi electric currents the unequal 
distribution of land and sea in the two hemisierea 
by affecting the operation of the suns heat in pn 
ducing evaporation from the latter which is probably 
one of the great sources of terrestrial electricity 
may easily be conceived to modify the general tend 
ency of such currents and to produce irregularities 
in them which may render a tisctory account of 
whatever still appears anomalous in the jenomena 
of terrestrial magnetism tikis branch of science 
thus becomes connected on a great scale with that 
of meteorology one of the most complicated and 
difficulty but at the same time interesting subjects of 



of natural philosophy 

physical research one however which has of late 
begun to be studied with a diligence which promises 
the speedy disclosure of relations and laws of which 
at present we can form but a very imperfect notion 

 the communicationof magnetism from the 
earth to a magnetic body or from one magnetic body 
to another is performed by a process to which the 
name of induction has been given and the laws and 
properties of such induced magnetism have been 
studied with much perseverance and success — prac 
tically by gilbert boyle knight whiston cavallo 
canton duhamelrittenhouse scoresby and others 
and theoretically by pinus coulomb and poisson 
and in our own country by messrs barlow and 
christie who have investigated with great care the 
curious phenomena which take place when masses 
of iron are presented successively in different posi 
tions by rotation on an axis to the influence of the 
earths magnetism the magnetism of crystallized 
bodies partly from the extreme rarity of such as are 
susceptible of anyconsiderable magnetic virtue has 
not hitherto been at all examined but wouldprobably 
afford very curious results 

• to electricity the views of the physical 
enquirer now turn from almost every quarter as to 
one of those universal powers which nature seems 
to employ in her most important and secret oper 
ations this wonderful agent which we see in 
intense activity in lightning and in a feebler and 
more difiused form traversing the upper regions of 
the atmosphere in die northern lights is present 
probably in immense abundance in every form of 
matter which surrounds us but becomes sensible

separation from one body to another under the

 the study of these phenomena and their 
laws until a comparatively recent period occiqiied 
the entire attention of electricians and constituted 
the whole of the science of electricity it appears 
as the result of their enquiries that all the pheno 
mena in question are explicable on the soppositioa 
that electricity consists in a rare subtle and highly 
elastic fluid which in its tendency to expand and 
difiuse itself pervades with more or less facility the 
substance of conductors but is obstructed and de 



of katural philosophy 

tamed from expansion more or less completely bj 
nonconductors it is supposed moreover that this 
electric fluid possesses a power of attraction for the 
particles of all ponderable matter tcether with 
that of a repulsion for particles of its own kind 
whether it has weight or is rather to be regarded as 
a species of matter distinct from that of which pon 
derable bodies consist is a question of such delicacy 
that no direct experiments have yet enabled us to 
decide it but at all events its inertia compared 
with its elastic force must be conceived excessively 
small so that it is to be regarded as a fluid in the 
highest degree achve obeying every impulse in 
ternal or external with the greatest promptitude 
in short a fluid whose energies can only be com 
pared with those of the ethereal medium by which 
in the imdulatory doctrine light is supposed to be 
conveyed the properties of hydrogen gas com 
pared with those of the denser aeriform fluids will 
in some slight degree aid our conception of the 
excessive mobility and penetrating activity of a 
fluid so constituted electricity however must be 
regarded as differing in some remarkable points from 
all those fluids to which we have hitherto been ac 
customed to apply the epithet elastic such as air 
gases and vapours in these the repulsive force 
of the particles on which their elasticity depends is 
considered as extending only to very small distances 
so as to affect only those in the immediate vicinity 
of each other while their attractive power by 
which they obey the general gravitation of all 
matter extends to any distance in electricity on 
the other hand the very reverse must be admitted 



 discourse on the study 

the force by which its particles repel each other 
extends to great distances while its force of ad 
hesion to ponderable matter must be regarded as 
limited in its extent to such minute intervals as 
escape observation 

 the conception of a single fluid of this 
kind which when accumulated in excess in bodies 
tends constantly to escape and seek a restoration 
of equilibrium by communicating itself to any others 
where there may be a deficiency is that which 
occurs most naturally to the mind and was accord 
ingly maintained by franklin to whom the science 
of electricity is under great obligations for those 
decisive experiments which informed us respecting 
the true nature of lightning the same theory was 
afterwards advocated by pinus who first showed 
how the laws of equilibrium of such a fluid might 
be reduced to strict mathematical investigation 
but there are phenomena accompanying its trans 
fer from body to body and the state of equilibrium 
it affects under various circumstances which ap 
pear to require the admission o£ tvx distinct jiuids 
antagonist to each other each attracting the other 
and repelling itself but each alike susceptible of 
adhesion to material substances and of transfer 
more or less rapid from particle to particle of them 
these fluids in the natural undisturbed state are 
conceived to exist in a state of combination and 
mutual saturation but this combination may be 
broken and either of them separately accumulated 
in a body to any amount without the other pro 
vided its escape be properly obstructed by sur 
rounding it with nonconductors when so acca

mulated its repulsion for its own kind and attraction 
of the opposite species in neighbouring bodies tends 
to disturb the natural equilibrium of the two fluids 
present in them and to produce phenomena of a 
peculiar description which are termed induced elec 
tricity curious and artificial as this theoiy may 
appear there has hitherto been produced no phe 
nomenon of which it will not afford at least a plau 
sible and in by far the majority of cases a very 
satisctory explanation it has one character 
which is extremely valuable in any theory that of 
admitting the application of strict mathematical 
reasoning to the conclusions we wduld draw from 
it without this indeed it is scarcely possible 
diat any theory should ever be fairly brought to 
the test by a comparison with facts accordingly 
the mathematical theory of electrical equilibrium 
and the laws of the distribution of the electric 
fluids over the surfaces of bodies in which they 
are accumulated have been made the subject of 
elaborate geometrical investigation by the most 
expert mathematicians and have attained a degree 
of extent and elegance which places this branch of 
science in a very high rank in the scale of nxa 
thematicophysical enquiry these researches are 
grounded on the assumption of a law of attraction 
and repulsion similar to those of gravity and mag 
netism and which by the general accordance of 
the results with cts as well as by experiments 
instituted for the express purpose of ascertaining 
the laws in question are regarded as sufficiently 
demonstrated

for the air in ittf sudden expansion cannot reabsorb in an in

ow natural philosophy 

nothing decisive has been offered on the subject 
and that conjectural modes of action hare in this 
instance too often usurped the ace of those to 
which a careful examinatichi ci lacts alone can 
lead us 

 philosophers had long been familiar with 
the effects of electricity abore referred to and with 
those which it produces in its sudden and violent 
tranrfer from one body to another rending and 
shattering the parts of the substances through which 
it passes and where in great quantity producing all 
the effect of intense heat igniting fusing and vo 
latilizing metals and setting fire to inflammable 
bodies even its occasional influence in destroying 
or altering the polarity of the magnetic needle 
had been noticed but as heat was known to be 
produced by mechanicid violence and as magnet 
ism was also known to be greatly affected by the 
same cause these effects were referred rather to 
that cause than toany tiring in the pecidiar nature 
of the electric matter and rarded rather as an 
indirect consequence of its mode of acticm than as 
connected with its intimate nature in short elec 
tricity seemed destined to furnish another in addi 
tion to many mstances of subjects insulated from 
the rest of philosophy and capable of being studied 
only m its own mtema rdations when the great 
discoveries of galvani and vokst placed a new 
power at the command of the ex p e ri m e n ter by 
whose means aose efeects wlich had before been 
crowded within an inappreciable instant could be 
developed in detail and studied at leisure and those 
ferces which had previously exlribited themselves 



 discourse on the study 

only in a state of uncontrollable intensity were 
tamed down as it were and made to distribute 
their efficacy over an indefinite time and to ru 
late their action at the will of the operator it was 
then soon ascertained that electricity in the act of 
its passage along conductors produces a variety of 
wonderful effects which had never been previously 
suspected and these of such a nature as to afford 
points of contact with several other branches of 
physical enquiry and to throw new and unexpected 
lights on some of the most obscure operations of 
nature 

 the history of this grand discovery affords 
a fine illustration of the advantage to be derived in 
physical enquiry firom a close and careful attention 
to any phenomenon however apparently trifling 
which may at the moment of observatim appear in 
explicable on received principles the convulsive 
motions of a dead frog in the neighbourhood of an 
electric discharge which originally drew gralvanis 
attention to the subject had been noticed by others 
nearly a century before his time but attracted no 
further remark than as indicating a peculiar sensi 
bility to electrical excitement depending on that 
remnant of vitality which is not extinguished in the 
organic firame of an animal by the deprivation of 
actual life galvani was not so satisfied he ana 
lysed the phenomenon and in investigating all the 
circumstances connected with it was led to the ob 
servation of a peculiar electrical excitement which 
took place when a circuit was formed of three dis 
tinct parts a muscle a nerve and a metallic con 
ductor each placed in contact with the other two 



on natural hilosopht 

and which was manifested by a convukiye motion 
produced in the muscle to this phenomenon he 
gave the name of animal electricity an unfortunate 
epithet since it tended to restrict enquiry into its 
nature to the class of phenomena in which it first 
became apparent but this circumstance which 
in a less enquiring age of science might have exer 
cised a fatal influence on the progress of knowledge 
proved happily no obstacle to the further develope 
ment of its principles the subject lining immedi 
ately taken up with a kind of prophetic ardour by 
yolta who at once generalized the phenomena re 
jecting the physiological considerations introduced 
by galvani as foreign to the enquiry and regarding 
the contraction of the muscles as merely a delicate 
means of detecting the production of electrical ex 
citements too feeble to be rendered sensible by any 
other means it was thus that he arrived at the 
knowledge of a general fact that of the disturbance 
of electrical equilibrium by the mere contact of dif 
ferent bodies and the circulation of a current ot 
electricity in one constant direction through a cir 
cuit composed of three different conductors to 
increase the intensity of the very minute and deli 
cate effect thus observed became his next aim nor 
did his enquiry terminate till it had placed him in 
possession of that most wonderful of all human in 
ventions the pile which bears his name through 
the medium of a series of well conducted and lo 
gically combined experiments which has rarely if 
ever been surpassed in the annals of physical 
research 
 though the original pile of yolta was feebly

compared to thove gigantic combinatioim which wra 
afterwards produced it sufficed however to ex 
hibit electricity under a vety diierent aqieet from 
any thing which had gone before and to bring into 
tiew those peculiar modifications in its action which 
dr wouaston was the first to render a satisdery 
account of by referring them to an ticrease of 
quantity accompanied with a diminuuon of inimniy 
in the supply afforded the discovery had not 
long been made public and the instrument in 
the hands of chemists and electricians before it 
was ascertained that the electric current trans 
mitted by it through conducting liquids produces 
in them chemical decompositions this ciqital dis 
covery appears to have been made in the first 
instance by messrs nicholson and carlisle who ob 
served the decomposition of water so produced it 
was speedily followed up by the still more important 
one g€ berzelius and hisinger who ascertained it aa 
a general law that in all the decompositions so 
effected the acids and oxygen become transferred to 
and accumulated around the positive — and hydro 
gen metals and alkalies jound the negative pole of a 
voltaic circuit being transferred in an invisible and 
as it were a latent or torpid state by the action of 
the electric current through considerable qmces 
and even through large quantities of water or other 
liquids again to reappear with all their pnrtiea 
at their appropriate restingplaces 

 it was in this state of things that the sulject 
was taken up by davy who seeing that the strongest 
chemical affinities were thus readily subverted bj 
th decomposing action of the pile conceived the 



t tfatural philosophta sso 

happy idea of bringing to bear the intense piwer of 
the enormous batteries of the royal institution on 
those substances which though strongly suspected 
to be compounds had resisted all attempts to de 
compose them the alkalies and earths they 
yielded to the force applied and a total revolution 
was thus effected in chemistry not so much by th 
introduction of the new elements thus brought to 
light as by the mode of conceiving the nature of 
chemical sdffinity which firom that time has been re 
garded as davy broadly laid it down in a theory 
which was readily adopted by the most eminent 
chemists and by none more readily than by berze 
lius himself as entirely due to electric attractions 
and repulsions those bodies combining most in 
timately whose particles are habitually in a state of 
the most powerful electrical antagonism and dis

the connection of magnetism and electricity 
had long been suspected and innumerable fruitless 
trials had been mae to determine in the affirmative 
or negative the question of such connection the 
phenomena of many crystallized minerals which 
become electric by heat and develope opposite 
electric poles at their two extremities offered an 
analogy so striking to the pokrity of the magnet 
that it seemed hardly possible to doubt a closer 
connection of the two powers tile developement 
of a similar polarity in the voltaic pile pointed 
strongly to the same conclusion and experimenti 
had even been made with a view to ascertain whether 
a pile in a state of excitement might not manifest a

disposition to place itself in the magnetic meridian 
but the essential condition had been omitted that of 
allowing the pileto discharge itself freely a conditioa 
which assuredly never would have occurred of itself 
to any experimenter of all the philosophers who 
had speculated on this subject none had so pertina 
ciously adhered to the idea of a necessary connection 
between the phenomena as oersted baffled often 
be returned to the attack and his perseverance was 
t length rewarded by the complete disclosure of the 
wonderful phenomena of electromagnetism there 
is something in this which reminds us of the obsti 
nate adherence of columbus to his notion of the 
necessary existence of the new world and the 
whole history of this beautiful discovery may serve 
to teach us reliance on those general analogies and 
parallels between great branches of science by which 
one strongly reminds us of another though no direct 
connection appears as an indication not to be neg 
lected of a community of origin 

 it is highly probable that we are still 
ignorant of many interesting features in electrical 
bcience which the study of the voltaic circuit will 
one day disclose the violent mechanical effects 
produced by it on mercury placed under conduct 
ing liquids which have been referred by professor 
erman to a modified form of capillary attraction 
but which a careful and extended view of the phe

 among the remarkable effects of electricity 
dbclosed by the researches of galvani and voltai 
perhaps the most so consisted in its influence on 
the nervous system of animals the origin of mus 
cular motion is one of those profound mysteries oi 
tiature which we can scarcely venture to hope will 
ever be fully explained physiologists however 
had long entertained a general conception of the 
conveyance of some subtle fluid or spirit from the 
brain to the muscles of animals along the nerves 
and the discovery of the rapid transmission of elec 
tricity along conductors with the violent effects 
produced by shocks tiransmitted through the body 
on the nervous system would very naturally lead to 
the idea that this nervous fluid if it had any real 
existence might be no other than the electrical 
but until the discoveries of galvani and volta thia 
could only be looked upon as a vague conjecture 
the charactef of a vera causa was wanting to give it 
any degree of rational plausibility since no reason 
could be imagined for the disturbance of the electrical 
equilibrium in die animal frame composed as it ii 
entirely of conductors or rather it seemed contrary 
to the then known laws of electrical communication 
to suppose any such yet one strange and surpris

possibility ci such disturbance viz the powerful

not without its intervals but which every successive 
discovery of animals heretofore imknown has tended 
to fill up the wonders disclosed by microscopic 
observation have opened to us a new world in 
which we discover with astonishment the extremes 
of minuteness and complexity of structure united 
while on the other hand the examination of the 
fossil remains of a former state of creation has 
demonstrated the existence of animals far surpassing 
in magnitude those now living and brought to light 
many forms of being which have nothing analogous 
to them at present and many others which afford 
important connecting links between existing genenu 
and on the other hand the researches of the com 
parative anatomist and conchologist have thrown 
the greatest light on the studies of the geologistf 
and enabled him to discern through the obscure 
medium of a few relics scattered here and there

high degree important when it is considered that 
the principles thus brought into view are for le

the essential ingredients on which the medical 
virtues of the plants depend the law of the dis

of the most interesting and important branches of

light remains to be thrown by future researches

that presented by the slow progress of the physical

 the part of the mass of mankind to the study oif

of form discoveries or at best permitted them to 
linger on record rather as literary curiosities than

ordinary afiairs of life and studiously kept involved 
in learned mystery effectually prevented these oc 
casional impulses from overcoming the inertia of 
ignorance and impressing any regular and steady 
progress on science its objects indeed were con 
fined in a rion too sublime for vulgar comprehen 
sion an earthquake a comet or a fiery meteor 
would now and then call the attention of the whole 
world and produce from all quarters a plentiful 
supply of crude and fanciful conjectures on their 
causes but it was never supposed that science 
could exist among common objects have a place 
among mechanical arts or find worthy matter of 
speculation in the mine ot the laboratory yet it 
cannot be supposed that all the indications of nature 
continually passed unremarked or that much good 
observation ftnd shrewd reasoning on it failed u 
perish unrecorded before the invention of printing 
enabled every one to make his ideas kpown to all 
the world the moment this took place however 
the sparks of information from time to time strudc 
out instead of glimmering for a moment and dying 
away in oblivion began to accumulate into a genial 
glow and the flame was at length kindled whicb 
was speedily to acquire the strength and rapid spread 
of a conflagratiom the universal excitement in thtf 
tninds of men throughout europe which the first 
outbreak of modem science produced has beea 
already spoken of but even the most sanguine 
anticipators could scarcely have looked forward to 
that steady unintermitted progress which it has 
abce maintained nor to that rid succession of 
great discoveries whidi has kept up the interest of

the first impulse still vigorous and undiminished i 
may truly indeed be said that there is scarcely g 
single branch of physical enquiry which is ei 
stationary or which has not been for many years 
past in a constant state of advance and ii whid 
the progress is not at this moment going on witl 
accelerated rapidity 

 among the causes of this hsppy and desirr 
able state of things no doubt we are to look in the 
first instance to that great increase in wealth and cii 
yilization which has at once afforded the necessary 
leisure and diffiised the taste for inteuectual pursuit 
unong numbers of mankind which have long been 
and still continue steadily progressive in every prin 
cipal european state and which the increase and fresh 
establishment of civilized communities in every dis 
t region are rapidly spreading over the whole 
globe it is not however merely the increased 
number of cultivators of science but their enlarged 
opportunities that we have here to consider which 
in all those numerous departments of natural re 
search that require local information is in fact the 
niost important consideration of all to this cause 
we must trace the great extension which has of late 
years been conferred on every branch of natural 
history and the immense contributions which have 
been made and are daily making to the depart 
ments of zoology and botany in all their ramifica 
tions it is obvious too that all the information 
that can possibly be procured and reported by the 
most enlightened and active travellers must fall 
infinitely short of what is to be obtained by indivi 
duals actually resident upon the spot travellers

fedeed may make collections may snatdi a few 
heatj observations may note for instance the dis 
trflktion of geological formations in a few detacbed 
points and now and then witness remarkable local 
phenomena but the resident alone can make con 
tinued series of regular observations such as the 
scientific determination of climates tides magnetic 
variations and innumerable other objects of that 
kind requires can alone mark all tjie details of 
geokical structure and refer each stratum by a 
careful and long continued observation of its fossil 
contents to its true epoch can alone note the habits 
of the animals of his country and the limits of its 
vegetation or obtain a satisfactory knowledge of its 
mineral contents with a thousand other particulars 
essential to that complete acquaintance with our 
globe as a whole which is beginning to be under 
stood by the extensive designation of physical geo 
graphy besides which ought not to be omitted 
multiplied opportunities of observing and recordii 
those extraordinary phenomena of nature which 
offer an intense interest from the rarity of their oc 
currence as well as the instruction they are calcu 
lated to afford to what then may we not look 
forward when a spirit of scientific enquiry shall have 
spread through those vast regions in which the pro 
cess of civilizatimi its sure precursor is actually 
commenced and in active progress and what may 
we not expect from the exertions of powerful minds 
called into action under circumstances totally differ 
ent from any which have yet existed in the world 
and oveif an extent of territory far surpassing that 
which has hitherto produced the whole harvest of 



 



or natural philosophy 

human intellect in proportion as tiie nmnber of 
those who are engaged on each department of phj 
sicai enquiry increases and e geographical extent 
over which they re spread is enlarged a iopor 
tionately increased facility of communication and 
interchange of knowledge becomes essential to the 
prosecution of their researdies with ful advantage 
not only is this desiraue to prevent a number of 
individuals from making the same discoveries at the 
same moment which besides the waste of valuame 
time has always been a fertile source of jealousies 
and misunderstandings by which great evils have 
been entailed on science but because methods of 
observation are continually undergoing new im 
provements or acquiring new fiicilities a knowledge 
of which it is for the general interest of science 
shoidd be diffused as widely and as rapidly as possible 
by this means too a sense of common interest of 
mutual assistance and a feeling of sympathy in a 
common pursuit are generated which proves a 
powerful stimulus to exertion and on the other 
hand means are thereby afforded oi detecting and 
pnting out mistakes before it is too late fir their 
rectification 

ss perhaps it may be truly remarked that next 
j to the establishment of institutions having either the 
j promotion of science in general or what is still more 
 practically efficacious in its present advanced state 
 that of particular departments of physical enquiry 
for their express objects nothing has exercised so 
powerful im influence on the prcess of modem 
iscience as the publication of monthly and quarterly

while the abstracts they from time to time if well

of general observation as well as to hold out in the 
most conspicuous manner modeb for emulative 
imitation in looking forward to what may hereafter 
be expected from this cause of improvement we are 
not to forget the powerful effect which must in 
future be produced by the spread of elementary 
works and digests of what is actually known in each 
particular branch of science nothing can ht more 
discouraging to one engaged in active research than 
the impression that all he is doing may very likely 
be labour taken in vain that it may perhaps have 
been already done and much better done than with 
his opportunities or his resources he can hope ta 
perform it and on the other hand nothing can be 
more exciting than the contrary impression thus 
by giving a connected view of what has been done 
and what remains to be accomplished in every 
branch those digests and bodies of science whi 
from time to time appear have in fact a very import 
ant weight in determining its future progress quite 
independent of the quantity of information they 
communicate with respect to elementary treatises 
it is needless to point out their utility or to dweq

 one of the means by which an advaiceat 
of physical science contributes greatly to fulerate 
and secure its further progress is the exftct know 
ledge acquired of physical data or thce normal 
quantities which we have more than once spoken 
of ui the preceding pies a knowledge 
which enables us not only to appretiate the accuracy 
of experiments but even to correct jeir results 
as there is no aurer criterion of the tate of science 
in any pge than the egree of qare bestowed and 
discernment exhibited in tlie choice of such data so 
as to afford the simplest possible grounds for the ap 
plication qf eories and the degree of accuracy 
attained in jtheir determinfitioii so there is scarcely 
any thing by whiqh scienqe can be mwe truly bene 
fited than by researches directed expressly to this 
object and to the construction of tables exhibiting 
the true nipxierical relations of the elements of 
theories and the actual state of nature in all its dif 
ferent branches it is oiily by such determinations 
that we can ascertain what changes are slowly and 
imperceptibly taking place in the existing order 
of things and the more accurate they are the sooner 
will this knowledge be acquired what might we 
not now have known of the motions of the socalled 
fixed stars had the ancients possessed the means of

observation we now possess and employed them as 
we employ them now 

 in any enumeration of causes which have 
 contributed to the recent rapid advancement of 
 science we must not forget the very important one 
of improved and constantly improving means of 
observation both in instruments adapted for the 
exact measurement of quantity and in the general 
convenience and welljudged adaptation to its pur 
poseg of every description of scientific apparatus 
in the actual state of science there are few observ 
ations which can be productive of any great advantage 
but such as afford accurate measurement and an 
increased refinement in this respect is constantly 
called for the degree of delicacy actually attained 
we will not say in the most elaborate works of the 
highest art but in such ordinary apparatus as every 
observer may now command is such as could not 
have been arrived at unless in a state of ttie mecha 
nical arts which in its turn such is the mutual 
reaction of cause and effect requires for its existence 
a very advanced state of science what an im 
portant influence may be exercised over the progress 
of a single branch of science by the invention ca 
ready and convenient mode of executing a definite 
measurement and the construction and conumon 
introduction of an instrument adapted for it cannot 
be better exemplified than by the instance of the 
reflecting goniometer this simple cheap and 
portable little instrument has changed the face of 
mineralogy and given it all the characters of one 
of the exact sciences

 our means of perceiving and measuring mi 
tiute quantities in the important relations of weight 
qace and time seem ahready to have been carried 
to a point which it is hardly conceivable they should 
surpass balances have been constructed which 
have rendered sensible the millionth part of the 
whole quantity weighed and to turn with the 
thousandth part of a grain is the performance of ba 
lances pretending to no very extraordinary degree of 
merit the elegant invention of the sphaerometer 
by substituting the sense of touch for that of sight in 
the measurement of minute objects permits the 
determination of their dimensions with a degree of 
precision which is fully adequate to the nicest pur 
poses of scientific enquiry by its aid an inch may 
be readily subdivided into ten or even twenty thou 
sand parts and the lever of contact an instrument 
in use among the german opticians enables us to 
appreciate quantities of space even yet smaller 
for the subdivision of time too the perfection of 
modem mechanism has furnished resources which 
leave very little to be desired by the aid of clocks 
and chronometers as they are now constructed a 
few tenths of a second is all the error that need 
be apprehended in the subdivision of a day and 
for the further subdivision of smaller portions of 
time instruments have been imagined which admit 
of almost unlimited precision and permit us to ap 
preciate intervals to the nicety of the hundredth or 
even the thousandth part of a single second 
when the precision attainable by such means is

contrasted with what could be procured a few ge 
neratkhis ago by the rude and clumsy workmanship 
of even the early part of the last century it will be 
no matter of astonishment that the sciences which 
depend on exact measurements ould have made 
a prqportional progress nor will any degree of 
nicety in physical determinations aiear beyond our 
reach if we consider the inexhaustible resources 
which science itself furnishes in renderii the 
quantities actually to be determined by measure 
great multiples of the elements required for the 
purposes of theory sa as to diminish in the same 
proportion the influence of any errors which may be 
committed on the final results 

s great indeed as have been of late the im 
provements in the construction of instruments both 
as to what regards convenience and accuracy it is to 
the discovery of improved methods of observation that 
the chief progress of those parts oi science which de 
pend on exact determinations is owing the balance 
ef torsion the ingenious invention of cavendish and 
coulomb may be cited as an example of what we 
mean by its aid we are enabled not merely to render 
sensible but to subject to precise measurement and 
subdivision degrees of force infinitely too feeble 
to affect the nicest balance of the usual construction 
even were it possible to bring them to act on it 
the galvanometer too affords another example of 
the same kind in an instrument whose range of 
utility lies among electric forces which we have no 
other means of rendering sensible much less of 
estimating with exactness in determinations of 
quantities less minute in themselves the methods 



of natural philosophy 

devised by messrs arago and fresnel for the 
measurement of the refractive powers transparent 
media by means of the phenomenon of difactiony 
may be cited as affording a degree of precisicm 
limited only by the wishes of the observer and tfeye 
time and patience he is willing to devote to his 
observation and in respect of the direction of 
observations to points from which real information 
is to be obtained and positive condusions drawn 
the hygrometer of daniell may be cited as an 
elegant example of the introduction into general use 
of an instrument substituting an indication founded 
on strict principles for one perfectly arbitrary 

 in speculating on the ture fhrospects of 
physical science we should not be justified in leav 
ing out of consideration the probabsity or rattier 
certainty of the occasional occurrence those happjr 
accidents which have had so powerftil an influence 
on the past occasions where a fortunate combiur

in his works the sciences have not been behind 
hand in affording their testimony to its truth 
nor are we to suppose that the field is in the 
slightest degree narrowed or the chances in iavour 
of such fortunate discoveries at all decreased by 
those which have already taken place on the 
contrary they have been incalculably extended 
it is true that the ordinary phenomena which pass 
before our eyes have been minutely examined and 
those more striking and obvious principles which 
occur to superficial observation have been noticed 
and embodied in our systems of science but not 
to mention that by far the eater part tf na 
tural phenomena remain yet unexplained every 
new discovery in science brings into view whole 
classes of facts which would never otherwise hare 
fallen under our notice at all and establishes rela 
tions which afford to the philosophic mind a con 
stantly extending field of speculation in ranging 
over which it is next to impossible that he should 
not encounter new and unexpected principles how 
infinitely greater for instance are the mere diances 
of discovery in chemistry among the innumerable 
combinations with which the modem chemist is 
famqiar than at a period when two or three imagin 
ary elements and some ten or twenty substances 
whose properties were known with an aroadi to 
distinctness formed the narrow circle within which 
his ideas had to revolve how many are the in 
stances where a new substance or a new property 
introduced into familiar use by being thus brout 
into relation with all our actual dements of knoir 



of natural philosophy 

ledgehas become the means of developing proper 
ties and principles among the most common objects 
which could never have otherwise been discovered 
had not platina to take an instance been an object 
of the most ordinary occurrence in a laboratory would 
a suspicion have ever occurred that a lamp could be 
constructed to bum without flame and should we 
have ever arrived at a knowledge of those curious 
phenomena and products of semicombustion which 
this beautiful experiment discloses 

 finally when we look back on what has been 
accomplished in science and compare it with what 
remains to be done it is hardly possible to avoid 
being strony impressed with the idea that we have 
been and are still executing the labour by which 
succeeding generations are to profit in a few in 
stances only have we arrived at those general 
axiomatic laws which admit of direct deductive 
inference and place the solutions of physical pheno
