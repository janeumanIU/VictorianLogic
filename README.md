# Semantic Change in Victorian Logic

This project is to map the semantic change in the technical terms of Victorian Logic from Whately to Whewell. Currently, the corpus is exclusively comprised of the first edition of books published explicitly on the subject. In the future, it will include texts from other sources, especially journals, and reach further in time. The current cut-off is 1860; but, the project will proceed in steps, first extending to 1874 (Jevons' <i>Principles of Science</i>), and later to 1910-13 (Russell and Whitehead's <i>Principia Mathematica</i>).
